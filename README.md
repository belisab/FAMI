## How to make changes:

1. Every time you start working on the project, start off by **pulling the changes** from the cloud repository. You can do this by using your code editor's Git controls (there should be a button labeled "Pull" somewhere, possibly under a "VCS" or "Commits" tab), or manually by running `git pull` in the terminal.

> [!WARNING]
> If there are merge conflicts, oh dear. Send a message to the WhatsApp group or the course Slack team, someone'll help :D

2. After you have made your changes, you need to **commit your work** by running `git commit -a -m "Your message here..."` or by pressing your code editor's "Commit" button. If you have added new files, you need to first run `git add .` (or select the files in your code editor)

3. Once you are finished, run `git push` or press a Push button in your code editor.

> [!WARNING]
> If the push fails (if you get yellow text in the terminal or your code editor complains), then you need to first pull changes (and probably resolve a merge conflict).

If you run into any issues, send a message to the WhatsApp group :D
