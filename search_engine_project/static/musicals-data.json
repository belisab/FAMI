        "description": "Fame is a stage musical based on the 1980 musical film of the same name , with book by Jose Fernandez, music by Steve Margoshes and lyrics by Jacques Levy . Conceived and developed by David De Silva , it premiered in 1988 in Miami, Florida , and has spawned many stagings worldwide, including an Off-Broadway production at the Little Shubert Theatre from 2003 to 2004, under the title Fame on 42nd Street .\n\nDe Silva had produced the 1980 film about students at New York City 's High School of Performing Arts . The critically and commercially successful film was followed by a six-season television series , and the musical. The musical is significantly rewritten from the previous adaptations, with an almost entirely new score except for the title Academy Award-winning song, \"Fame\". The film is referred to several times in the script and in two songs. It tells the story of several students who attend the school, among them fame-obsessed Carmen, ambitious actress Serena, wisecracking comedian/bad boy Joe, quiet violinist Schlomo, \"talented but dyslexic\" dancer Tyrone, determined actor Nick, overweight dancer Mabel, and a serious dancer, Iris, from a poor family.",
        "synopsis": "A group of vibrant, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, energetic young people gather to audition to study at New York City's High School of Performing Arts .\nMiss Sherman, the homeroom teacher, warns the freshman class that it takes a lot more than dreams to succeed at \"P.A.\" The students acknowledge that it takes (\"Hard Work\"). Before Algebra class, Serena meets Nick Piazza, he explains his passion for the performing arts and tells her he wants his acting to move people emotionally (\"I Want to Make Magic\"). Mr. Myers, the drama teacher, asks them to think about how a physical sensation can trigger an emotional response. Joe discusses the physical reactions that happen whenever he thinks of a beautiful girl (Carmen) in dance class (\"Can't Keep it Down\" or the alternative lyrics, \"Can't Keep It Cool\"). Meanwhile, in dance class Tyrone can't get to grips with Ballet and states that he can do better, resulting in the whole class doing a hip hop dance. This makes Miss Bell see Tyrone's potential as a choreographer, so she partners him with Iris, a ballerina. Iris mocks Tyrone's lack of classical dance experience. Enraged at her comments, he begins a rap expressing his anger (\"Tyrone's Rap\"). Iris apologizes and confesses that she is not really rich, but scared and they share a kiss.\n\nAt lunch, Carmen, a self-assured, cocky Latina spitfire, asks Mr. Myers if she can skip class on Friday to audition for West Side Story. He tells her that it would just be another role for her to hide behind. Carmen, enraged, dreams of seeing her name in lights and people gasping as she walks down the street (\"There She Goes/Fame!\"). The other students join in her fantasy and begin an exciting, electrifying dance.\n\nSerena and Nick are rehearsing another scene and Serena confesses that she wants to try something romantic and passionate.  Serena is in love with Nick, but Nick is mainly focused on acting. Serena laments her unrequited love (\"Let's Play a Love Scene\"). Afterwards, Carmen interrupts Schlomo while he practices his violin, giving him lyrics that she wrote for the melody he always plays. Schlomo tries them out, and changes some of the lyrics with Carmen and they share their first romantic moment. (\"Bring on Tomorrow\"), which results in Carmen joining the band. Carmen kisses Schlomo and leaves. Goody (also in the band, along with Lambchops) makes fun of Schlomo afterwards. In the hallway, Miss Sherman talks to Tyrone about his care-free attitude towards education. She threatens to keep him out of the Fall Festival if his grades don't improve.  Miss Bell overhears and argues that Tyrone's artistic endeavors are more important than his academic performance (\"The Teachers' Argument\"). Tyrone storms off, threatening to drop out of school, and Miss Sherman reminds the gathered crowd of students of their academic commitments (\"Hard Work (Reprise)\").\n\nThe students begin their junior year with the P.A. Fall Festival (\"The Junior Festival\").\n\nNick congratulates Serena for getting the lead female role of Juliet in their junior show, Romeo and Juliet .  Serena gets excited and assumes that Nick got the role of Romeo.  However, she is surprised to learn that Joe Vegas has the role of Romeo and Nick got the part of Mercutio. Lambchops suggests that Nick is gay, and when Serena confronts him about it, Nick angrily replies that he is straight . Serena is so angry she decides to channel it into her acting (\"Think of Meryl Streep \"). Later, at a dance rehearsal, Mabel, an overweight dancer, complains about retaining water, and other problems she faces with the size of her body. She confesses that, although she tries many weight-loss schemes and diets, she always goes back to the \"Seafood Diet: I see food, and then I eat it!\" She prays aloud for God's help in keeping her from becoming \"the world's fattest dancer\" (\"Mabel's Prayer\"), eventually having an epiphany and deciding to switch her major to acting. Carmen tells Schlomo of her plan to leave school and go to Los Angeles .  She has met a Hollywood agent named Elliot Greene, who is sending her a plane ticket. Schlomo begs her not to go. He had seen her getting into Elliot's limousine and accuses her of using cocaine with him. Schlomo tells Carmen he loves her, but is left alone with his violin/flute/keyboard (depending on what the actor can actually play).\n\nIn English class, Tyrone is reading a Superman comic book.  Miss Sherman catches him, and forces him to stand up in front of the class and read from the comic book.  He accuses her of trying to make him look stupid.  He then accuses her of racism . Miss Sherman slaps him in the face and, shocked by what she has done, runs off.  Tyrone says to his classmates he doesn't need her help, or the ability to read or write - he is a dancer, and that's all he needs (\u201cDancin\u2019 on the Sidewalk.\u201d). Miss Sherman returns and apologises for her outburst. She reveals that she believes Tyrone may have dyslexia and offers him extra help, to which Tyrone refuses and storms off. Miss Sherman pleads after him not to give up on her (\u201cThese Are My Children\u201d).\n\nThe students rehearse Romeo and Juliet. Joe, insecure playing Romeo, has been ad-libbing. Joe starts to make fun of what he is saying, although is scared he'll mess up. Serena pleads with him to be serious in the part. Nick offers to show him how to play Romeo and winds up kissing Serena in their first romantic moment. Tyrone asks Iris why she has been avoiding him all year.  She says she doesn't want to be tied to a loser.  To show her that he is serious, he tells her he is repeating his senior year and reads a passage of Leaves of Grass to her.  They dance a pas de deux and walk off together, hand in hand.\n\nCarmen is standing in front of the school looking physically wasted and disoriented.  She spots Schlomo and tells him the truth about her experiences in Hollywood (\"In L.A.\").  Carmen promises him that she will quit the drugs and get her GED . He gives her a couple of dollars and sadly departs, reminding Carmen that he will always love her.\n\nAt the farewell party, everyone is dressed up and the celebration is loud and festive. Nick confesses his feelings to Serena and they decided to try to date although they are heading to different colleges (\"Let's Play a Love Scene (Reprise)\"). Schlomo reveals through monologue that Carmen has died of a drug overdose, and dedicates the classes' final senior song to her memory (\"Bring On Tomorrow (Reprise)\").\n\nAfter the bows, Carmen comes back dancing on the roof of a taxi cab and sings \"Fame\" for the Finale.",

However, it still contains elements of the \"I Want to Make Magic (Reprise)\" in it. Carmen and Serena only sing during the junior festival when the alternate (longer) versions of the songs are used.\n\n\u00a7 The Pas De Deux uses music from the ballet \"This Is Forever\" by Steve Margoshes. However, some productions use music by Mark Berman .\n\n\u2020 In some productions \"In LA\" is replaced with \"Out Here On My Own\".",

        "title": "Eileen (opera)",
        "description": "Eileen is a comic opera in three acts with music by Victor Herbert and lyrics and book by Henry Blossom , based loosely on the 1835 novel Rory O'More by Herbert's grandfather, Samuel Lover . Set in 1798, the story concerns an Irish revolutionary arrested by the British for treason. Eileen, his nobly born sweetheart, helps him to escape by disguising him as a servant.\n\nAfter two Cleveland performances at the Colonial Theatre on January 1\u20132, 1917 titled Hearts of Erin , the operetta moved on to Boston, changing its name to Eileen . It then opened at the Shubert Theatre on March 19, 1917 and ran for 64 performances. It was produced by Joe Weber , formerly of the comedy duo Weber and Fields . It then toured, but a fire destroyed its sets and costumes three months into the tour. The show was not revived in New York until the end of the 20th century. In 1982, a single on-book concert performance was given at Manhattan's Town Hall , featuring E. G. Marshall as O'Day, Judy Kaye as Lady Maude and Roderick Cook as Sir Reginald. In 1997, it was produced and recorded by the Ohio Light Opera . In 2012, a small-scale production was given by the Light Opera of New York.\n\nHerbert was eager to write an \"Irish\" musical to celebrate the land of his ancestors. His score was well received by the critics, but the libretto received some harsh reviews. Alexander Woollcott wrote: \"Mr Blossom [must have] gathered his material and atmosphere by reading for quite half an hour in some public library.\"",
        "synopsis": "It is 1798, the year of the brutal uprisings of the United Irishmen , who seek to reclaim their lands from the British. Lady Maude, the attractive widow of Lord Estabrook, an English lady, is the mistress of Castle Sligo , once held by the O'Day family, creating resentment among the Irish locals. Her niece, Eileen, has returned to Ireland after schooling at a convent in France; she is accompanied by the bumbling Sir Reginald. Shaun Dhu leads a band of smugglers and revolutionaries on the Western coast of Ireland that includes Barry O'Day, son of a legendary Irish rebel. The band stores its loot at Biddy's Black Bull Inn in an effort to avoid nasty British tax collector Humpy Grogan. Lady Maude and Eileen stop at the Inn when their carriage breaks down. Barry protects them from some village drunks and flirts with Maude, although it is really Eileen who has caught his eye; Maude is sympathetic to the rebels' cause. Colonel Lester, the local British authority, comes to arrest Barry for treason, but Lady Maude keeps the Colonel at bay, and Barry escapes disguised as Lady Maude's groom.\n\nLater, at Castle Sligo, Lady Maude has developed affection for Barry. Eileen explains that Barry is a rogue.  Nevertheless, Maude decides to help Barry escape again from the Colonel by putting a coachman's uniform on her guest, Sir Reggie, making him a decoy. Sir Reggie is arrested and sentenced to death before the Colonel learns that he has been fooled and that Barry has gotten away again.\n\nBy the time of Lady Maude's birthday, Eileen and Barry have fallen in love. Learning that Barry is there, the Colonel has his men surround the castle. Barry surrenders, and he is about to be shot, when news arrives that the King has pardoned the rebels. The arrest is reversed, various couples are united, including Barry and Eileen, and it is declared that \"Ireland shall stand among all nations of the world.\"",

        "title": "Kinky Boots (musical)",
        "description": "Kinky Boots is a musical with music and lyrics by Cyndi Lauper and book by Harvey Fierstein .\n\nBased on the 2005 British film Kinky Boots , written by Geoff Deane and Tim Firth and mostly inspired by true events, the musical tells the story of Charlie Price. Having inherited a shoe factory from his father, Charlie forms an unlikely partnership with cabaret performer and drag queen Lola to produce a line of high-heeled boots and save the business. In the process, Charlie and Lola discover that they are not so different after all.\n\nFollowing the show's conception in 2006, the creative team was assembled by 2010. The original production of Kinky Boots premiered at the Bank of America Theatre in Chicago in October 2012, with both direction and choreography by Jerry Mitchell , and starring Stark Sands and Billy Porter as Charlie and Lola, respectively. It made its Broadway debut at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre on April 4, 2013, following previews that began on March 3, 2013. The musical began a US tour in 2014. The Broadway production ended its six-year run on April 7, 2019.\n\nHaving initially been less well received by theatre critics and at the box office than another 2013 Broadway production, Matilda the Musical , Kinky Boots entered the 2013 awards season as an underdog. However, less than a month after opening, Kinky Boots surpassed this rival with audiences in weekly box office gross and later enjoyed a post-Tony boost in advance sales. The production earned a season-high 13 nominations and 6 Tony wins, including Best Musical , Best Actor for Billy Porter and Best Score for Lauper in her first outing as a Broadway songwriter, making her the first woman to win alone in that category. The musical's cast album premiered at number one on the Billboard Cast Albums Chart and number fifty-one on the Billboard 200 chart. Making its West End debut in 2015, in 2016, it won three Laurence Olivier Awards , including Best New Musical .",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nCharlie Price grows up as the fourth-generation scion in the family business, Price & Son, a shoe manufacturing company with its factory in Northampton . Another young boy, growing up in London , is as fascinated by shoes as Charlie is bored by them. But in this case, it is a pair of red women's heels that have attracted his attention, aggravating his strict father. Years pass. Charlie's father is aging and hopes Charlie will take over the business. Still, Charlie is eager to move to London with his status-conscious fianc\u00e9e, Nicola, and pursue a real estate career (\"The Most Beautiful Thing\").\n\nCharlie has barely made it into his new flat in London when his father dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, but they're neither stylish nor affordable, and the market for them is drying up. Though Charlie has no desire to run Price & Sons, he is determined to save the factory and his father's legacy. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.\n\nReturning to London, Charlie meets friend and fellow shoe salesman, Harry, in a pub to ask for help. Harry can only offer a temporary solution and advises Charlie not to fight the inevitable (\"Take What You Got\"). Leaving the pub, Charlie witnesses a woman being accosted by two drunks. He intervenes and is knocked unconscious. He comes to in a seedy nightclub, where the woman he attempted to rescue is revealed to have been the club's drag queen headliner, Lola, who performs with his backup troupe, the \"angels\" (\"Land of Lola\"). Recuperating from his ordeal in Lola's dressing room, an uncomfortable Charlie notices that the performers' high-heeled boots are not designed to hold a man's weight. Lola explains that the costly and unreliable footwear is an essential part of any drag act.\n\nCharlie returns to the factory and begins reluctantly laying off his workers. Lauren, one of the women on the assembly line, explodes at Charlie when given her notice and stubbornly tells him that other struggling shoe factories have survived by entering an \"underserved niche market.\" This gives Charlie an idea (\"Land of Lola\" {Reprise}), and he invites Lola to come to the factory to help him design a women's boot that can be comfortable for a man (\"Charlie's Soliloquy\"/\"Step One\").\n\nLola and the angels arrive at the factory, and he is immediately dissatisfied with Charlie's first design of the boot. Quickly getting the women of the factory on his side, Lola draws a quick design of a boot, explaining that the most important factor is by far the heel (\"The Sex is in the Heel\"). George, the factory manager, realizes a way to make Lola's design practical. An impressed Charlie begs Lola to stay until a prestigious footwear show in Milan in three weeks, to design a new line of \"kinky boots\" that could save the factory. Lola is reluctant, as he is already receiving crass comments from Don, the foreman, and some of the other workers, but is flattered by Charlie's praise, and finally agrees.\n\nCharlie announces that the factory will be moving ahead with production of the boots. He thanks Lauren for giving him the idea and offers her a promotion. She accepts and is horrified but thrilled to realize that she is falling for him (\"The History of Wrong Guys\").\n\nThe next day, Lola shows up in men's clothes and is mocked by Don and his friends. An upset Lola takes refuge in the bathroom, and Charlie attempts to comfort him. Lola explains that his father trained him as a boxer but disowned him when he showed up for a match in drag. The two discover their similarly complex feelings toward their fathers, and Lola introduces himself by his birth name: Simon (\"Not My Father's Son\").\n\nNicola and her boss Richard Bailey arrive from London and present Charlie with a plan for the factory that Richard has drawn up: closing it and converting it into condominiums. Charlie refuses but is shocked to discover that his father had agreed to this plan before he died, presumably because Charlie was not there to run it. He refuses to sell, and soon the workers are celebrating as the first pair of \"kinky boots\" is finished (\"Everybody Say Yeah\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nSome of the factory workers are not enthusiastic about the radical change in their product line. Some of them, especially the intimidating Don, make Lola feel very unwelcome. Lola taunts him back, enlisting the female factory workers to prove that Lola is closer to a woman's ideal than is Don (\"What a Woman Wants\"). Lola presents Don with a unique wager to see who is the better \"man\": Lola will do anything that Don specifies if Don will do the same thing for him. Don's challenge is for Lola to fight him in a boxing match at the pub. Charlie, remembering Lola's background, is horrified. Lola easily scores against Don in the ring, but ultimately lets Don win (\"In This Corner\"). Afterward, Don asks why Lola let him win, and Lola replies that he could not be so cruel as to humiliate Don in front of his mates. Lola then gives Don his part of the challenge: \"accept someone for who they are.\"\n\nCharlie is pouring his own money into the factory to ensure that it will be ready in time for Milan, and he is getting frantic that the product is not right, angrily making his staff redo what he considers shoddy work. Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When Charlie discovers that Lola has decided to have his angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at him, humiliating him in front of the other workers. Lola storms out, and the workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man (\"Soul of a Man\").\n\nLauren finds Charlie and tells him to come back to the factory. It is revealed Don has persuaded the workers to return to work and to sacrifice a week's pay to ensure that the boots can be finished in time for Milan. The astonished and grateful Charlie asks Don if he has paid up on his wager by accepting Lola. Lauren explains that the person that Don has accepted is Charlie himself.\n\nAs he heads to the airport for Milan, Charlie leaves a heartfelt apology on Lola's voicemail. Meanwhile, Lola performs his act at a nursing home in his hometown. After he leaves the stage, he speaks to his dying father, and reaches a sense of closure (\"Hold Me in Your Heart\").\n\nCharlie and Lauren arrive in Milan. But without models, Charlie is compelled to walk the runway himself. Lauren is thrilled by his dedication (\"The History of Wrong Guys (Reprise)\"), but the show threatens to be a disaster. Just as all seems lost, Lola and his angels arrive to save the day. Lauren and Charlie share their first kiss, and the whole company celebrates the success of the \"Kinky Boots\" (\"Raise You Up/Just Be\").",

        "synopsis": "The show is set in Thebes in Ancient Greece (\"Welcome to Greece\"). Jupiter is bored with life on Mount Olympus and decides to have an affair with a mortal woman, which turns out to be the beneficent Princess Alcmene .  However, she is happily married to General Amphitryon , who is away fighting battles. Jupiter concocts a plan to disguise himself as the General, but when Alcmene first meets the new general she is apprehensive. Jupiter wins her over with a depiction of the enchanted evening that awaits her (\"Heaven on Earth\").\n\nMercury , Jupiter's son, has accompanied him to Earth , but he turns out to be useless when Jupiter wants to know the result of the battle with Sparta . Dolores, a member of the chorus, is left to find out (\"Gods on Tap\").\n\nSosia, one of the General's slaves, arrives back home, happy to be alive after the years he spent fighting in the wars. Mercury, however, has assumed his identity, so he is not welcome (\"Surprise!\"). Sosia leaves just as Jupiter comes out from the palace, after his night with the Princess. Due to the fact this was Jupiter's first time as a human, he starts to feel human emotions  (\"Love - What a Concept\"). Anxiety fills him, wondering if Alcmene loves him. He asks her, but he is disappointed to learn she has spent the night with a charlatan . Mercury advises his father to give the Princess time, and eventually she will be cognizant of the truth (\"Wait 'Til it Dawns\").\n\nThe General is looking forward to reuniting with his wife (\"Enter the Husband/I Know My Wife\").  En route home, he encounters Sosia, who tells him he was barred from the house by, none other than the imposter General (\"It Was Me\").  Once at home, the general is perturbed by his wife's unfeeling greeting (\"Back So Soon\"). He is astounded to learn she spent an enchanted, passionate reunion the night before, which she describes in glowing detail (\"Wonderful\").  Angered, the General accuses the Princess of adultery . He storms out, while his wife is crying and still claiming innocence.  Sosia too is reuniting with his wife nagging wife, Charis. He too is astounded by his wife's actions, when he discovers her going out for a night on the town (\"At Liberty in Thebes\"). She contends that he gave her permission  (it was actually Mercury in disguise). Thinking it over, she contemplates if the man last night was an impostor.\n\nStill disguised as the General, Jupiter verifies her beliefs but says she should not be held responsible. He persuades her that there is only one way she could have been misled (\"Jupiter Slept Here\"). She is comforted to be pardoned from blame, but she furious to be deceived by Jupiter. Mercury suggests ways to win women's hearts after Jupiter becomes disheartened since he feels he can win the Princess' affection again (\"Something of Yourself\"). Jupiter attempts to gain sympathy by telling her how lonely he is on the Mountain, but he is still disguised as the General (\"Olympus is a Lonely Town\").\n\nAlcmene forgives Jupiter because she has been so moved, and Jupiter is ecstatic. But, Jupiter then encounters another human emotion: Jealousy. He then feels he cannot leave her on Earth with her real husband. To take her, he plans to make her into a constellation, so that way he can be with her forever in heaven, despite the objections by Mercury. Dolores uses this plot point as an excuse for a large production number with her as the featured performer (\"A Star is Born\").\n\nAlcmene is then faced with a problem: The General comes back and she is confused by two identical husbands. She is then pitted to choose one, and chooses Jupiter, thinking that is her actual husband. The General objects, but in turn doing so, he realizes he is condemning his wife as a willing debauchee. He takes back his plea and declares he will defend her purity of heart till death. Jupiter has yet another new emotion: compassion (\"Mine Eyes Have Seen\"). Jupiter then leaves Alcmene, abjures from the challenge to mend harmony on Earth. He returns to the Heavens, re-assuming his role as Eternal Ruler of The Universe, albeit dolefully (\"Heaven on Earth (Reprise)\").\n\nThe show is first and foremost a Comedy, and uses (and abuses) a few inside jokes. The first: The Show is produced (allegedly) by \"Murray the Furrier\", a fictitious furrier who deals in used and discount furs. Included in the actual contract to produce the show are stipulations that credit be given to Murray the Furrier in all advertising  media and program books.\n\nSecond: The character Delores, a chorus girl with only one line, has no business being on stage. It is obvious that she has been cast as a favor to Murray the Furrier, who is revealed to be her sugar daddy. She has only one \"scripted\" line, but that doesn't stop her from having an ongoing conversation with the audience throughout.  She speaks directly to the audience. When it comes time for her one scripted line, she flubs it. \nThird: the show lends itself to the style of a comedy routine from the 1950s (reminiscent of The Dick Van Dyke Show). The chorus (Tom, Dick, Horace and Delores) are stylized characters who tap dance in sandals. The leads are encouraged to be played broadly. It come off as light fun.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIt's the roaring 1920s and the beautiful, young Queenie, although she tries, cannot find a lover able to satisfy her desires \u2013 until she meets Burrs, a vaudevillian clown with a voracious appetite for women. Both Queenie and Burrs have now met their emotional and sexual match (\"Queenie Was a Blonde\").\n\nFor a while, they live together happily sated. However, the relationship eventually sours. Burrs' violent nature, which once thrilled Queenie, now scares her (\"The Apartment\"). Still, she longs to generate the same excitement that brought them together. She suggests a party, and Burrs agrees (\"Out of the Blue\").\n\nThe party begins with a parade of guests: Madelaine the lesbian, Eddie the thug, Mae the dimwit, Jackie the dancer, lover-brothers d'Armano, Dolores the hooker, and Nadine the minor (\"What a Party\"). Although Queenie radiates beauty and confidence, Burrs preys on other women. He makes his move on their youngest guest, Nadine. Despite her casual reprimand of his behavior, Queenie wants to hurt Burrs in return (\"Raise the Roof\").\n\nThe vivacious Kate arrives with her new friend, Mr. Black (\"Look at Me Now\"). Queenie, quite taken by Black, plans to make her move on him. Kate drags him away to meet the other guests. Queenie's plans are momentarily undermined (\"He Was Calm\"). The party's revelry continues: Burrs hits on Kate; Madelaine hits on Nadine, Eddie chugs beer and almost fights with Burrs. During the chaos, Black finds himself equally as taken by Queenie as she with him - much to the chagrin of Kate (\"Poor Child\"). As revenge, Kate plans on seducing Burrs. Meanwhile, in a corner of the room, Madelaine is in a drunken stupor and on the prowl for a woman with very little success (\"An Old-Fashioned Love Story\").\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the party guests begin to get comfortable, indulging in alcohol and cocaine and growing increasingly intoxicated (\"By Now the Room Was Moving\"). Though Queenie is fully aware that Burrs will threaten her physically, she makes her move on Mr. Black, easily getting him to dance with her. Burrs watches them, his ire rising. Unsuccessfully, Kate tries to get Burrs to dance \u2013 then to defuse the situation, Kate takes Queenie out of Mr. Black's arms and dances with her instead.\n\nBurrs' violent reaction against Mr. Black and Queenie is prohibited by the whole company dancing the Juggernaut (\"The Juggernaut\"). At its end, Mr. Black and Queenie are together again. To get the reaction he wants from Queenie, Burrs grabs Nadine, the minor, and makes out with her. This enrages Kate who throws Nadine to the ground by her hair. Madelaine rushes to aid Nadine. Burrs cuts into Mr. Black and Queenie's dancing.\n\nManaging to have her to himself, Burrs tells Queenie to stay away from Mr. Black. Laughing at him, Queenie says she will do whatever she chooses. He twists her arm. They are interrupted by Oscar and Phil at the piano (\"Intro to 'Wild, Wild Party'\"). Burrs releases Queenie, seeing that too many people are watching.\n\nBurrs and Queenie join Oscar and Phil's epic musical number based on the story of Adam and Eve \u2013 Burrs plays Adam and Queenie, Eve (\"A Wild, Wild Party\"). Their number is interrupted by a discontented neighbor. Eddie and Mae yell insults to the man and the crowd goes wild. The two celebrate their togetherness (\"Two of a Kind\").\n\nSuddenly, Mr. Black approaches Queenie and pointedly asks why she stays with an abusive brute (\"Of All the Luck\"). She reflects on her situation and comes to the conclusion that, perhaps, she has just learned to like the aggressive treatment (\"Maybe I Like It This Way\").\n\nElsewhere, Kate is attempting to seduce Burrs. He refuses her advances and expresses his deepest, darkest feelings for Queenie - she is driving him crazy (\"What Is It About Her?\"). Kate tries to kiss Burrs, but he pushes away. Black kisses Queenie. She embraces him.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe party rages on. Kate is alone and reflecting on her youthful indulgence (\"The Life of the Party\").\n\nAlone in the bathroom, Queenie is taking stock of her predicament. Although she's angry that she has confided in Black, a virtual stranger, she recognizes his goodness (\"Who Is This Man?\"). This both stirs and confuses her feelings. Black enters the bathroom with a drink. The two share a moment as Black conveys his admiration for Queenie (\"I'll Be Here\"). Suddenly, Burrs comes in seeking Queenie's attention. He apologizes for his behavior and asks her forgiveness. Before she can respond, Kate arrives. She unsuccessfully tries to draw Burrs back onto the dance floor. Both men pull for her affections and devotion\u2014Mr. Black asks Queenie to leave the apartment with him. Burrs ask her to stop the party and let them return to their isolation. Queenie is unable to respond to either man (\"Listen to Me\").\n\nFrustrated and hurt, Burrs lashes out by physically threatening her. His outburst causes Queenie to leave the bathroom and Black quickly follows. It is clear that Burrs is quickly becoming desperate and depressed (\"Let Me Drown\"). Soon after, he hallucinates and hears Queenie's voice in his head. Thinking Mae is Queenie, he mistakenly attacks her and angers Eddie. A fight ensues (\"The Fight\").\n\nMr. Black and Queenie return to find Eddie viciously beating Burrs. Queenie is afraid that Burrs will be killed if it is not stopped. Black rushes in and knocks Eddie unconscious with a chair out of concern. Mae tends to Eddie and Kate comes to the aid of a passed-out Burrs (\u201cTake A Hit\u201d). Realizing all of the trouble he is causing, Mr. Black tells Queenie that he will leave. Queenie, however, cannot let him go and leads him into the bedroom (\"Tell Me Something\"). In a moment of passion, the two begin making love. The party guests follow suit in the living room (\"Come With Me\").\n\nEarly the next morning, the revelers lie asleep in the living room, and Jackie dances for the last time before he departs (\"Jackie's Last Dance\"). Kate wakes Burrs who is beside her. Queenie is strikingly absent. Burrs, fearing the worst, staggers to the bedroom to find her in the bed with Black. When the two lovers wake, Queenie recoils in shock; Black jumps up and attempts to tackle Burrs but fails. Burrs moves to the dresser and locates a gun. Full of rage, he vacillates between trying to force Queenie to choose between the two men and threatening to kill Black, Queenie, or himself, claiming that when one of them dies, whoever it is, it will satisfy him (\"Make Me Happy\").\n\nBlack, who realizes that Burrs is about to make a decision, takes the chance and lunges at Burrs. The gun goes off. Burrs is dead. Fearing that Mr. Black will now be executed for the death, Queenie urges him to flee. Before leaving, Black professes his love for her (\"Poor Child [Reprise]\"). Queenie, now having lost both men, questions how things managed to reach that point of loss. She exits the apartment - with her coat - all eyes upon her sad, beautiful grace (\"How Did We Come to This?/Queenie Was a Blonde [Reprise]\").",

Set in early 19th-century France , Les Mis\u00e9rables tells the story of Jean Valjean , a French convict, and his desire for redemption. After stealing a loaf of bread for his sister's starving child, Valjean is imprisoned for 19 years and released in 1815. When a bishop inspires him with a tremendous act of mercy, Valjean breaks his parole and starts his life anew and in disguise. He becomes wealthy and adopts an orphan, Cosette. A police inspector named Javert pursues Valjean over the decades in a single-minded quest for \"justice\". The characters are swept into a revolutionary period in France, where a group of young idealists attempts to overthrow the government at a street barricade in Paris.\n\nThe French musical premiered in Paris in 1980 with direction by Robert Hossein . Its English-language adaptation, with lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer , produced by Cameron Mackintosh and directed by Trevor Nunn and John Caird , has been running in London since October 1985, making it the longest-running musical in the West End and the second longest-running musical in the world after the original off-Broadway run of The Fantasticks . Many other long-running productions followed on Broadway and around the world, and a film adaptation was released in 2012.",
        "synopsis": "### Prologue\n\nIn 1815 France, Jean Valjean , \"Prisoner 24601\", is released on parole by guard Javert after 19 years hard labor in prison for stealing bread (\"Work Song (Look Down)\"). Marked by his yellow ticket of leave (\"On Parole\"), Valjean is shunned and cannot find decent work until the Bishop of Digne offers him shelter. Valjean steals the Bishop's silver, but the Bishop pretends to have given it to him and also gives him a pair of silver candlesticks (\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"). Valjean vows to start an honest life (\"Valjean's Soliloquy (What Have I Done?)\"). He tears up his ticket, breaking parole.\n\n### Act I\n\nBy 1823, Valjean is living disguised as Monsieur Madeleine, a factory owner and the mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer . Fantine , a single mother working at Valjean's factory, is fired after a disagreement with the lustful foreman and sinks into poverty (\"At the End of the Day\"; \" I Dreamed a Dream \"), selling her locket and hair, and becoming a prostitute (\"Lovely Ladies\"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Javert, now a police inspector, arrests her. Valjean intervenes and takes her to a hospital (\"Fantine's Arrest\").\n\nWhen Valjean rescues a man pinned by a runaway cart, Javert, who has pursued him over the years, suspects his true identity. Learning an innocent man is about to be jailed in his place, Valjean confesses (\"Who Am I?\"). At the hospital, Fantine dies after Valjean promises to rescue her daughter Cosette from the thieving Th\u00e9nardiers , innkeepers who are paid to raise her (\"Fantine's Death (Come to Me)\"). Valjean escapes Javert (\"The Confrontation\"). In Montfermeil , the Th\u00e9nardiers use Cosette as a servant, treating her cruelly, while extorting money from Fantine (\"Castle on a Cloud\"; \"Master of the House\"). Valjean pays them 1,500 francs to release Cosette (\"The Bargain\") and takes her to Paris (\"The Waltz of Treachery\").\n\nIn 1832 Paris, unrest grows with the impending death of the merciful General Lamarque . Student revolutionaries Marius Pontmercy and Enjolras prepare for an uprising. The Th\u00e9nardiers, who have lost their inn and now lead a gang of street criminals, plot scams. Their daughter \u00c9ponine befriends the streetwise urchin Gavroche (\"Look Down\"). She secretly loves Marius, but he falls instantly for Cosette when he meets her with Valjean, whom the Th\u00e9nardiers attempt to rob (\"The Robbery\"). Valjean is recognized, but he and Cosette escape; Javert vows to recapture him (\"Stars\"). Marius persuades \u00c9ponine to help him find Cosette (\"\u00c9ponine\u2019s Errand\").\n\nAs Enjolras rallies the students (\"The ABC Caf\u00e9/Red and Black\"), Marius pines for Cosette. News of Lamarque\u2019s death sparks plans for revolution (\" Do You Hear the People Sing? \"). Cosette confronts Valjean about his secrets (\"In My Life\"). \u00c9ponine finds Cosette, and Marius and Cosette confess their love (\"A Heart Full of Love\"). Th\u00e9nardier and his gang arrive to rob Valjean's house but are foiled by \u00c9ponine\u2019s warning (\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\"). Believing Javert has found him, Valjean plans to flee with Cosette. On the eve of the 1832 Paris Uprising , Enjolras exhorts all of Paris to join the revolution. \u00c9ponine acknowledges in anguish that Marius will never love her. Javert plans to spy on, while the students and rebels steel themselves for battle (\" One Day More \").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe students build a barricade; Marius discovers that \u00c9ponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels (\"Building the Barricade\"). To keep her safe, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette (\" On My Own \"). Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. The French army arrives, demanding surrender (\"At the Barricade\"). Javert, disguised as a rebel, is exposed as a spy by young Gavroche (\"Little People\"). Wounded during the fighting, \u00c9ponine dies in Marius\u2019s arms, confessing her love (\"A Little Fall of Rain (Eponine's Death)\").\n\nValjean arrives disguised as a soldier, hoping to protect Marius (\"Night of Anguish\"). He saves Enjolras from a soldier. Valjean releases Javert instead of executing him, shaking Javert\u2019s rigid view of God and justice (\"The First Attack\"). As dawn approaches, the students prepare for attack (\"Drink with Me\"). Valjean prays for Marius's safety, offering God his own life (\"Bring Him Home\"). Enjolras realizes the people of Paris have not risen up but resolves to fight on (\"Dawn of Anguish\"). The army attacks; Gavroche is killed (\"The Second Attack (Death of Gavroche)\"), and all the students but Marius die. Valjean carries a gravely wounded Marius through the sewers and collapses (\"The Final Battle\"). Th\u00e9nardier, looting bodies, comes upon the unconscious Valjean and Marius, taking a ring from the latter and fleeing (\"Dog Eats Dog\"). At the sewer's exit, Valjean finds Javert waiting; he begs Javert for time to bring Marius to a doctor. Javert, unable to reconcile Valjean\u2019s mercy with his worldview, kills himself (\"Javert\u2019s Suicide\").\n\nParis mourns the fallen students (\"Turning\"). Marius grieves his friends and wonders who saved him (\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\"). Valjean blesses Marius and Cosette\u2019s marriage (\"Every Day\") but tells Marius he is an escaped convict and must leave to protect Cosette (\"Valjean\u2019s Confession\"). At their wedding (\"Wedding Chorale\"), the Th\u00e9nardiers attempt to blackmail Marius, who realizes Valjean carried him from the barricades (\"Beggars at the Feast\"). Marius and Cosette rush to find Valjean.\n\n### Epilogue\n\nAt a convent, Valjean awaits death. Fantine\u2019s spirit assures him of forgiveness. Cosette and Marius arrive in time to bid farewell. Valjean thanks God for seeing Cosette grown and happy (\"Valjean\u2019s Death\"). He entrusts her with his past and tells her the truth about her mother. Guided by the spirits of Fantine and \u00c9ponine, who remind him that \"to love another person is to see the face of God\", he dies at peace, joining the souls of the fallen in a hopeful vision of freedom (\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" (reprise)\").",

Extra dialogue was written for the show by Jonathan Biggins and Phillip Scott .\n\nThe stage musical has no relationship to the 1982 film The Man from Snowy River , or the 1988 sequel The Man from Snowy River II , or the television series The Man from Snowy River .\n\nAll poetry narrated in the musical was written by Banjo Paterson , including the lyrics to the songs \" Waltzing Matilda \" (with music written by Marie Cowan), and \"As Long as Your Eyes Are Blue\" (the music to which was \"Clancy's Theme\", which was written by Bruce Rowland for the film The Man from Snowy River ).",
        "synopsis": "On John Conroy's property, the 2-year-old colts and fillies are mustered and brought to the homestead for horse breaking . Two of the colts are of very good stock, especially the beautiful and spirited colt sired by the famous racehorse Regret (John Conroy says that the colt is worth a thousand pounds (\u00a31000) and that he wants the colt to eventually be the stud horse for the property).\n\nJim Ryan arrives at John Conroy's property following the death of his father. When he and Conroy's daughter, Kate, see each other, it is love at first sight for them both.\n\nJim, however, finds resentment at his presence at the station , both from John Conroy, the owner of the property, and the station's stockmen and station hands , with Dan Mulligan (the leading hand), disdainfully commenting \" We don't want any swagmen here \". Saltbush and McGinness McGee also make disparaging remarks about Jim Ryan's horse, with Saltbush sarcastically asking Jim if he bought his horse from a Mark Foy's catalogue, and McGinness McGee commenting that it was more likely that the horse had been saved from a glue factory .\n\nJohn Conroy also comments that they have enough men working on the property already. Kate pleads with her father to give Jim a job at the property, and he finally relents, saying that Jim can help break the horses. John Conroy resents it when Jim Ryan says that he knows of a better way to break horses than the horse-breaking method being used at the property. However, John Conroy says that Jim could prove his expertise in horse-breaking by breaking the colt from Regret.\n\nDuring the night, the Brumby herd gallops close to the homestead, and the colt from Regret breaks free from his tethers and joins them. John Conroy is furious at the loss of his prized colt, and unfairly blames Jim for what has occurred. Conroy decides to get all the crack riders (expert horse riders) from the stations near and far to muster at the homestead and hunt for the Brumbies, offering a reward of \u00a31000, and angrily orders Jim to leave the property first thing in the morning.\n\nThe crack riders gather at the homestead the following morning, including Harrison, who made his fortune when Pardon won the cup (a reference to the President's Cup, a lesser known race held in Manindie, New South Wales). Another crack rider at the homestead was Clancy of the Overflow (who was a friend of Jim). Jim shyly turns up to join in the ride to hunt for the colt and Brumbies, but finds that, apart from his friend, Clancy, he is not wanted by anyone on the ride. Clancy convinces the others that, as both Jim and his horse were mountain-reared, they would be of great help in the ride.\n\nThe Brumbies are too quick for the riders and, when it becomes too steep and dangerous with wombat holes (burrows, where a horse could break a leg), all riders stop short of the dangerous descent \u2014 apart from Jim, who continues to chase the Brumby herd - finally bringing the herd (including the colt) back to John Conroy's property.\n\nJohn Conroy is delighted to have his colt back again, and gives his approval to Jim marrying Kate. A concert and country dance, as well as a superb equestrian pageant, are then held in celebration and recognition of Jim's deed, and all ends happily.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nAs Riley and her best friend Cairo prepare for the annual cheerleading sleepover in the basement of Riley's home, Riley expresses her desire to prove herself as the new captain of the Giles Corey High cheerleading squad, while lamenting the team's \"loser\" status. Meanwhile, the other team members arrive, with varying levels of enthusiasm, as Cairo tries to get Riley to relax (\"Worst Team Ever\"). The meeting is delayed until Annleigh arrives late, with her step-sister Farrah, who is clearly drunk, in tow. While Riley attempts to lead them all in an introduction exercise, each team member expresses their inner concerns and worries, but ultimately states that they don't care (\"Don't Even\"). Cairo suggests a game of truth or dare and makes Mattie, the freshman on the team, drink the contents of Farrah's bottle. Riley tries to get them back on track by practicing a cheer, but Farrah refuses to participate if Chess is part of the team. Farrah berates Chess for being stoned and dropping her during a cheer, which was the reason the team went viral the previous year. Kate rises to her defense, stating that Farrah is drunk, and the argument escalates until Riley insists Kate take a walk and calm down.\n\nChess follows her friend outside and Kate confesses her fears over Chess moving away to college, since Kate is a junior while Chess is a senior (\"Skype Tomorrow\"). When Kate asks Chess to come back inside with her, Chess tries to stay outside and they argue until Kate finds Chess's bottle of pain medication and leaves, furious. At the same time, Farrah tries to get Annleigh to stop texting Clark, who is Annleigh's boyfriend, and pay attention to her, accidentally breaking her phone in the process. Annleigh tells Farrah that they will never be sisters and leaves, furious. Chess and Farrah divulge their concerns over their lives and their vices while the other girls describe the struggles of being teenage girls (\"Before the Breakdown\"). Alone, Chess hears strange noises and is murdered by an unseen person.\n\nBack in the kitchen, Annleigh is surprised by Clark, who has snuck into the sleepover to see her. The couple share their desires with each other and confirm their commitment to each other and their chastity, with Clark proposing to Annleigh (\"Forever\"). Before Annleigh can respond, Cairo comes to retrieve her and Clark hides in the pantry. The doorbell rings and Cairo and Annleigh introduce themselves to the pizza delivery girl, Eva Sanchez, who they recognize as the star cheerleader of West High's team, who are the Tigers' rivals. In the living room, Reese is ignored by the other girls because she is just the mascot and she reveals her dreams to be popular and liked, the way Riley and the others are, as well as her desire to be on the team (\"Captain of the Team\"). When Kate returns without Chess, Reese volunteers to take her place in the routine, but the other members pressure Riley to say no. Instead, Reese is sent to find Chess and Farrah. Mattie stumbles to the bathroom, drunk from the earlier dare. In the other bathroom, Reese finds Farrah throwing up from the alcohol she has consumed. Reese and Farrah have an honest heart to heart, where Reese, who has long been the victim of bullying due to her weight , asks Farrah to stop calling her \" Reeses \". Farrah begs Reese not to tell the others that she drank so much. When Reese leaves, Farrah reflects on her life (\"Before the Breakdown (Reprise)\") and pours the rest of her flask down the toilet. Someone knocks on the door, and Farrah apologizes for being drunk before she is killed in the shower by an unseen person.\n\nMeanwhile, Annleigh checks on a drunk Mattie and Cairo confronts Kate about her feelings for Chess. Mattie comes back into the room, bloody from hitting her head in the bathroom. Cairo follows an upset Riley into the kitchen, where they argue over who has done more for the other. Both believe that they are responsible for the other's success and thus deserve better treatment (\"Wallflower\"). They hear a scream and run outside to find Kate trying to save a dead Chess. In the bathroom, Reese finds Farrah's body and is surprised by Clark. Startled and afraid, Reese attacks Clark and hits him with the showerhead, believing him to be the person who killed Farrah. Realizing that it was Clark she attacked after turning on the lights, Reese attempts to wake him up, but she panics when she realizes that he died after falling and hitting his head on the toilet. When the other girls come running in after hearing her scream, Reese lets them assume Clark was killed by the same person as Chess and Farrah.\n\nPanicked by the deaths, Riley tries to call the police, but Cairo is worried that they will be blamed for the murders and stops her. Instead, she proposes that they pin the murder on Mattie, a girl who they barely know and who is drunk and covered in blood. The team reluctantly agrees to Cairo's plan and work together to plant a murder weapon. As Mattie staggers in and asks what's happening, the girls pass the knife with blood on it to Riley as they surround Mattie and the lights go out (\"Defense\").\n\n### Act II\n\nMattie is in prison. She writes a letter to her parents about how bad her life is now, and how she should never have joined the cheer team (\"Mattie's Lament\").\n\nThe Tigers return to Riley's, with two new promising team members, Reese, and Eva Sanchez. Cairo accuses Riley of avoiding her and for paying for Eva's scholarship to come to their school. The girls once again assemble in the basement, where Riley does her best to convince them that they can still have a great year (\"Phoenix\"). Kate, who keeps hearing Chess's ghost, is furious at them all for trying to act as if nothing happened. They argue until Kate announces that she is going to call the police and fix what they've done.\n\nOutside, Kate and Annleigh struggle over their feelings for their dead loved ones, with the ghosts of Farrah, Clark, and Chess watching them and asking them to promise not to forget them (\"Move On\"). Reese follows Kate outside and begs her not to call the police. When Kate asks her why, Reese confesses to accidentally killing Clark. Annleigh overhears and angrily attacks Reese for letting her believe that Clark died after cheating on her with Farrah. As the two begin to fight and Riley, Cairo, and Kate try to separate them, Eva watches the chaos and wrestles with whether or not she should stay on the team; on one hand, being on the Tigers means that she is at a better school and can receive a better education, but the team members are clearly unstable (\"Shut Up and Cheer\").\n\nDismayed over the fighting, Riley goes inside to get Annleigh and Reese some ice and tells everyone that they can leave. Cairo follows her, insisting that Riley stop them from leaving. Cairo believes they need to maintain the lie in order to stay out of trouble and they argue over what to do next. Riley leaves, and Cairo struggles over Riley's decision not to listen to her (\"Wallflower (Reprise)\"). Back in the basement, Riley finds that the door is locked and the Wi-Fi is down. While Riley searches for a key, she asks them to talk out their issues. Cairo, Kate, Annleigh, and Reese argue over which one of them could have been the murderer (\"IDK\").\n\nAnnoyed, Riley tries to get them to just practice cheering. When the team refuses, Riley becomes increasingly agitated and breaks down as the rest of the girls watch. Cairo realizes that Riley has the key and Kate and Reese attempt to reassure her, but an erratic Riley confesses to the murders (\"The Breakdown\"). After a struggle, Reese knocks Riley out and Cairo helps to tie her up. Annleigh is sent to call the police while Eva helps Kate, whom Riley stabbed in the thigh. Riley tells them that no one will believe them if they turn her in, but Eva reveals she recorded Riley's whole confession on her phone. Riley begs Cairo to untie her as police sirens wail.\n\nLater, in the gym, the remaining Tigers return to practice. Kate and Annleigh reveal that they are coping with the deaths of their loved ones (\"Move On (Reprise)\"). Mattie is back from Juvie, Cairo is the new cheer captain, Annleigh has met a new guy in grief counseling, and Kate is dating Eva. Eva reminds them all that they have community service for being accessories to the crime. Reese starts to show them all the new cheer and they all, including the ghosts of Farrah, Chess, and Clark, as well as Riley, who is in prison, reflect on moving on and healing with the support of each other (\"Finale\").",

Rain gives audiences the experience of seeing Beatles' songs performed live that were never done so by the band itself. It predates the popular Broadway show Beatlemania by several years. Rain has played Broadway , and toured for years.\n\nThe show takes the form of a roughly chronological history of The Beatles via their music. About 30 songs are performed during the show. Other than some onstage banter, there is very little dialogue during the production, which consists mostly of exact re-enactments of the Beatles' music. The multimedia production uses high-definition backdrops that feature psychedelic effects, vintage television commercials, and video footage of Rain cast members recreating iconic Beatle moments. For legal reasons, Rain never calls its performers the names of the actual members of The Beatles.\n\nEach production of Rain features two performers for each member of the Beatles, who alternate shows; plus an off-stage keyboardist to replicate the studio sounds familiar from later Beatles records.",

When this scene closes, The Beatles journey to America, beginning their tour at The Ed Sullivan Show . Moving forward, The Beatles' directions are changing musically while their band grows in popularity performing their largest concert at New York City 's Shea Stadium . Subsequent scenes use hallucinogenic and psychedelic designs to represent The Beatles' ever increasing experimentation with substances and Eastern philosophies. The show culminates with the breakup of the group and the end of the 1960s.",

Number 17 is where the Banks family lives: George and Winifred Banks, their two naughty children Jane and Michael, their cook/maid, Mrs. Brill and their house boy, Robertson Ay. Things are not going well for Jane and Michael. They are out of control and, as the show starts, their latest nanny, Katie Nanna, storms out. After that, Mrs. Brill and Robertson Ay complain about living in a \"madhouse.\" The children decide to write the advertisement for a new nanny (\" The Perfect Nanny \"), but George, having a very different idea of what constitutes the perfect nanny, tears up the piece of paper and throws it in the fireplace. The family all reflect on if they will ever find the perfect nanny (\"Cherry Tree Lane - Part 2\"). Within moments, Mary Poppins arrives, restored advertisement in hand, and takes charge of the Banks children, having every confidence in her own qualifications and merits (\" Practically Perfect \").\n\nOn the children's first outing to the park, they meet Bert and, despite their reservations, Mary teaches them that they must learn to look past appearances. To illustrate the point, Mary brings the park statues, including a mythological figure named Neleus, to life (\" Jolly Holiday \"). A storm starts to brew and the children quickly hurry home, but not before Neleus mentions how much he misses his father.\n\nWhile Mary manages the children, other problems lie with their parents. Winifred is aware that she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband. George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult. In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party (\"Cherry Tree Lane (Reprise) / Being Mrs. Banks / Jolly Holiday (Reprise)\"). Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts it out with a lesson (\" A Spoonful of Sugar \"). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming and Winifred reflects on her failure at pleasing George (\"A Spoonful Of Sugar (Reprise)\").\n\nMary takes the children to visit their father at the bank where he works (\"Precision and Order\"). There, George is busy dealing with possible investment clients: firstly, an ambitious man named Herr Von Hussler with an elaborate money-making scheme, and then a middle-class man named John Northbrook with a simple factory project. George is furious when Mary turns up with the children, but an innocent question asked by Jane (What's more important, a good man or a good idea?) makes him realise how much his values have changed (\" A Man Has Dreams \") since he was an idealistic young man. He then decides to accept Northbrook's project and rejects Von Hussler's, even though he knows the bank disapproves.\n\nOutside St. Paul's Cathedral, Mary introduces the children to the Bird Woman (\" Feed the Birds \"). Jane is suspicious of her, but Michael responds to the Bird Woman and throws crumbs for the birds. On the trip home, the children meet the enigmatic Mrs. Corry who runs a magic sweet shop that also sells words (\" Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious \").\n\nThe children return home in high spirits, unaware that things have gone wrong for their father. Unknown to them, George's decision to reject Von Hussler has cost the bank dearly, and he is suspended without pay. George explodes with rage at the children and they are sent to the nursery. Reacting to their father's outburst, Mary briefly points out that other members of the family are rarely there to take care of the parents, before Jane and Michael get into a fight over Jane's doll Valentine, prompting a displeased Mary to order them to bed and enchant them to sleep. The frightening consequence of Jane's anger becomes apparent moments afterwards, as Valentine and the rest of Jane and Michael's disgruntled toys come to life and join Mary in teaching them a lesson in how to take better care of their belongings and toys (formerly \"Temper, Temper\", now \"Playing the Game\").\n\nBelieving that Jane and Michael need personal growth, Mary decides to leave Cherry Tree Lane to bring them to their senses, and speaks with Bert about her decision (\"Chim Chim Cher-ee \u2013 Rooftop Duet\"). She then flies away using her magical parrot headed umbrella . Jane and Michael wake up to find Mary Poppins and their toys gone, leaving only a note on the floor that reads, \"Dear Jane and Michael, keep playing the game. Au Revoir, Mary Poppins.\" Mrs. Brill sees them awake, and when asked about what \"Au Revoir\" means, she tells them that it means \"Till we meet again\" before sending them in for bed.\n\n### Act II\n\nIn a misguided attempt to please her husband, Winifred arranges for his childhood nanny, Miss Andrew, to take over from the suddenly departed Mary (\"Cherry Tree Lane (Reprise)\"). At the sight of her, a terrified George flees, exclaiming \"the Holy Terror!\" To everyone's shock and dismay, he is right. Miss Andrew is a brutal and cruel tyrant , quick to administer her own terrible elixir (\"Brimstone and Treacle Part 1\") and discipline by threatening to split Jane and Michael up by taking charge of Jane and sending Michael to boarding school. After Miss Andrew goes to her room, Jane and Michael decide that running away is the only solution.\n\nThe children find their good friend Bert, who cheers them up and helps Michael fulfill his dream of flying a kite (\" Let's Go Fly a Kite \"). Mary Poppins flies in on the kite from the sky and reunites with the children. They update her on Miss Andrew and she takes them home, planning to \"surprise\" Andrew. Also hiding in the park is George, who is depressed over his supposed lack of achievements (\"Good For Nothing\"). Searching for him is Winifred, who at last understands her husband and the damage that was done to him by Miss Andrew (\"Being Mrs Banks (Reprise)\").\n\nWhen the children return to Number 17, Mary sets Caruso, Miss Andrew's lark, free from his cage. This leads to a confrontation between the two nannies, ending with Miss Andrew having a taste of her own medicine as she is trapped in a large birdcage and vanishes down below (\"Brimstone and Treacle Part 2\"). Winifred and then George return at this point, surprised but pleased that Miss Andrew has \"left\".\n\nThe group ascends to the rooftops, where Bert introduces the children to his friends the chimney sweeps (\" Step in Time \"). The sweeps' dance eventually enters the house, causing chaos. As the sweeps quickly exit, George receives a telegram from the bank requesting his presence there. George assumes that he has been fired and decides it's time to sell the family heirloom. However, the vase is shattered accidentally by Mrs. Brill, who goes into a despairing shock since she had been cleaning it from the top of the shelf. When she is being led away for comfort, George goes to clean the broken pile himself, to find it reveal a collection of gingerbread stars from his childhood. This leads to a brief moment of reflection for George (\"A Man Has Dreams (Reprise) / A Spoonful Of Sugar (Reprise)\"). After shaking hands with Bert, George leaves to meet the Chairman of the Bank.\n\nAt the children's encouragement, Winifred decides to follow her heart and be at George's side at the bank (\"Anything Can Happen (Part 1)\"). Unseen to anyone else, Mary takes Jane and Michael into the sky to follow, where they watch the unfolding events. On his way to the bank, George encounters the bird woman and gives her tuppence to feed the birds (\"Feed The Birds (Reprise)\")\n\nAt the bank (\"Precision And Order (Reprise)\"), George is surprised to learn the consequence of his choice: far from ruining the bank, he has made a fortune by both rejecting Von Hussler and approving Mr. Northbrook's loan. They ask for the word that made them so successful, which George admits to be Mary's word, (\" Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (Reprise) \"). Winifred, arriving to defend her husband, finds instead he is the hero of the hour. After she mentions Miss Andrew's name to the Bank Manager, the old man, too, relates his experience under \"the Holy Terror\". Winifred convinces the manager to quadruple George's salary. George apologizes for underestimating her, and together they return to the house. Mary and Bert take the children across the skies and they see everyone they met along their journey including Mrs. Correy, Neleus, and even Miss Andrew, who kindly shakes hands with Michael (\"Anything Can Happen (Part 2)\").\n\nMary realises that with the family reunited and happy, her task is done. With regret, she says goodbye to Bert with a kiss on the cheek and sets off (\"A Spoonful Of Sugar (A Task Is Done)\"). Jane and Michael accept that Mary is leaving them and tell her that they'll never forget her. The two children watch as their parents waltz happily together and Mary flies high above the audience using her magical parrot headed umbrella.",

        "description": "Starship is a musical with music and lyrics by Darren Criss , and a book by Matt Lang, Nick Lang, Brian Holden, and Joe Walker.\n\nStarship is about an alien planet inhabited by giant insects , called Bug-World. One of these insects, named Bug, comes across a crashed human starship and becomes infatuated with the idea of becoming a Starship Ranger, and he gets his chance when a group of humans land on Bug-World in an attempt to colonize the planet.\n\nThe musical was performed February 11 -23rd, 2011, at the Hoover-Leppen Theatre in Chicago , Illinois (this was the first StarKid stage production to not be performed on the University of Michigan campus). It was produced by StarKid Productions and directed by Matt Lang. The musical stars an ensemble cast featuring Joey Richter as the lead, Bug. The group put the entire musical up on YouTube on April 30, 2011. The musical's cast recording debuted at No. 134 on the Billboard 200 and No. 1 for Top Cast Albums.\n\nAn audio-only sequel, Starship: Requiem , was included as a perk for fans who contributed to Firebringer 's funding and was intended to be released on Christmas of 2016 but was delayed until February 2018.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nBug, an alien insect from the planet Bug-World, is watching a video about \"Starship Rangers\" in a crashed starship he has found and longs to be like the humans he sees on the screen. His friend Roach comes to find him for the job assigning ceremony and voices his dislike for Bug's constant talk of Starship Rangers. Bug seems certain that he is not like everyone else and that he is destined for greater things than a typical bug job (\"I Wanna Be\"). Shortly after, Bug runs into Bugette, a caterpillar assigned with carrying an egg sac until it hatches. It is clear she is romantically interested in Bug, but he rebuffs her advances. When the time comes for the bugs to be assigned a job by the Overqueen, Roach is given the prestigious job of \"Queen Impregnator\", while Bug is stuck with being an \"egg planter.\"\n\nSuddenly, a starship arrives on Bug-World, and Starship Ranger February of the Galactic League of Extraterrestrial Exploration (G.L.E.E.) touches down on the planet's surface. February is beautiful but dim and is desperate to prove herself as a true Starship Ranger. She meets what she believes to be the planet's indigenous life, but she is chased by the Mosquito siblings and captured by some of the hive's \" mammal wranglers.\"\n\nThe Starship Rangers remaining on the ship, including formerly tough Commander Up, second-in-command tomboy Taz, brainy Specs, mellow Krayonder, and the sweet and simple Tootsie Noodles, receive a distress signal that February is in danger. Before the team leaves, Junior, the son of the commander of G.L.E.E., gives them an android named Mega-Girl to take along, which the team reluctantly accepts despite the not-so-long-ago Robot Wars. Up received a famous injury during the Robot Wars, but Taz convinces him that he is still the man he once was, and is still the man who inspired her to become the person she is today, (\"Get Back Up\").\n\nBug doesn't adapt well to his first day of being an egg planter, hesitant to accept his mundane job (\"Life\"). Bug finds February, who has been blinded by bug mucus and taken captive. Because she cannot see, and Bug is the only Bug-World inhabitant who knows the human language from viewing the video on the crashed ship, February thinks that Bug is another captured human Starship Ranger. Bug sees this as his opportunity to live out his dreams, so he frees February and runs away with her. He runs into Bugette, who is shocked that he is running away with a human (\"Life (Reprise)\").\n\nUp and the other Rangers find their way to where February's communication device's signal is coming from and encounter some of the bug inhabitants of Bug-World. They try to fight off the \"monsters\" and the bug inhabitants try to protect themselves from the \"invaders\" (\"Hideous Creatures\").\n\nBug tries to tell February the truth amongst the fighting between the Rangers and bugs, but is interrupted when Mega-Girl attacks him with her lasers, ultimately causing Bug to run away and the Rangers to retrieve February. However, Mega-Girl betrays the Rangers and leaves them behind, taking only the now-unconscious February with her.\n\nBug is brought before the Overqueen because of his actions, and is sentenced to death. Before he can be squashed, Roach arrives and sticks up for Bug, using his high status to save his friend. Because of this, the Overqueen lets Bug live, but forbids him from ever leaving the hive or making contact with humans again (or singing). It is revealed a jealous Bugette was the one who informed the Overqueen of Bug's actions. She tries to apologize, but Bug rejects her.\n\nBug is then visited by the Mosquitos who take Bug to meet their boss, Pincer. Bug and Pincer discuss how they each want to befriend the humans and don't want to do the jobs the Overqueen assigned them to. Pincer reveals he has obtained a \"brain leech\" indigenous to the bug world, which allows two creatures to become psychically linked, and a cryotube containing a brain dead human body, recovered from the crashed starship, and proposes that Bug can take control of this body. Pincer's only condition is that Bug befriends the humans and brings them \"for dinner\". Bug eagerly agrees, not knowing that Pincer intends to eat their brains and let the Mosquitos suck their blood (\"Kick It Up a Notch\").\n\nThe Rangers escape from the bugs, but are not dealing well with being stranded on the bug planet, especially Taz, who finally realizes that Up has gone soft since the end of the Robot Wars. She takes over as the leader of the Rangers.\n\nThe team gets stuck in a giant spider's web, but Bug, now in the human body, convinces the spider not to eat them and joins the Rangers, who think he is the sole survivor of the starship crash from eighteen years before. The group decides to find February's ship to get back to their own. Roach tries to talk Bug out of going, but he has made up his mind to live his dream (\"Status Quo\").\n\n### Act II\n\nJunior contacts the leader of G.L.E.E., Evil Dr. Spaceclaw. It is revealed that Junior sent February to the planet by herself so she would be implanted with a bug egg and be returned to Earth and mass-produce an alien bug army. Spaceclaw, Junior's father, is pleased with his son's work but urges him to return with the bug soon. However, when Mega-Girl scans February, no alien life is detected.\n\nThe Rangers make it back to the ship. To keep the ship from leaving, Junior tells the Rangers that the ship's warp crystals are missing, meaning they are stuck there. Everyone goes their separate ways to rest before beginning the hunt for the crystals. Taz is still giving Up the cold shoulder and refuses to spend time with him. Tootsie confesses his feelings for Mega-Girl, while Bug struggles to tell February the truth about himself (\"The Way I Do\").\n\nBug goes to Up for some advice about his situation with February, but ends up helping Up overcome his feelings of weakness. In return, Up convinces Bug that being himself is what is important. Bug decides to take February back to Bug-World to show her his true nature. Junior overhears this and plans to go after them to re-initiate his plan and kill Bug. Junior asks Mega-Girl to keep the Rangers distracted, but she refuses because of her feelings for Tootsie. Junior removes her inhibitor chip, causing her to regain her suppressed feeling of lethal aggression towards humans.\n\nMeanwhile, Bug brings February back to Bug-World to try to show her his true self through bug culture. The other bugs look at the humans with disgust, but Roach explains that there is beauty in everything and tries to show that to February (\"Beauty\"). February is less than impressed with Bug-World, leading Bug to have second thoughts about revealing his secret. February suddenly has the idea that Bug must have brought her to Bug-World to take her to his crashed starship to obtain its warp crystals. Junior follows after them, but is captured by the Mosquitos.\n\nBug brings February to the crashed starship, and the two stumble upon a more complete version of the video Bug had been watching, revealing that G.L.E.E. already knew about the bug inhabitants and sent the crew to capture one, leading to them all being killed. February pieces together Junior's plan in a moment of clarity, and the duo rushes back to the ship to warn the other Rangers.\n\nJunior is brought to Pincer's lair, where Pincer reveals that he killed the survivors of the starship crash eighteen years before, and that Bug, who is in fact a bug, is actually working for him. Junior tells Pincer that Bug is working with the humans, so in exchange for his life, weapons, and secrets about the Overqueen and her hive, Junior forms an alliance with Pincer and promises him more humans to eat.\n\nBug and February return to the starship, where they tell the crew about Junior's plan. As another ship docks, the crew prepares to arrest Junior. However, Pincer and the Mosquitos invade the ship, and Pincer coerces Bug into telling the Rangers the truth about himself by threatening to kill February. Krayonder sacrifices himself so the other rangers can escape.\n\nMega-Girl attacks Tootsie and Specs. Tootsie reveals he changed his last name to Megagirl (on his planet, a person's last name is what they love) and affirms that he loves her even though she is a robot. Tootsie's showing of affection causes her to overcome her programming and download emotion software, allowing them to be together.\n\nMeanwhile, the Mosquitos ambush Taz and start sucking her blood. Up, seeing the bugs hurting Taz, Up tells them to suck his blood instead. When they do, Up starts using breathing exercises to force each of them to drink more of his blood than their bodies can handle, and they explode. Up and Taz are ecstatic that he is still tough and Up realizes that he needed to learn to kill \"with [his] heart,\" and that caring about Taz doesn't make him weak, but only makes him stronger.\n\nBug and Pincer battle. As Pincer prepares to kill February, Bug stabs Pincer and locks the two of them in the ship's airlock . Bug confesses his love for February and says his final goodbyes to his friends before having February jettison himself and Pincer out of the airlock into space.\n\nBecause his human body was destroyed, Bug's mind returns to his bug body on Bug-World, where Junior is attacking the hive, (\"Kick It Up a Notch (Reprise)\"). Bug catches up with Junior, who wants to take the Overqueen with him, even though it means the whole hive will die without her. Junior fires his weapon at Bug, and Bugette jumps in the way, sacrificing herself. Her larva then spring from her egg sac and attack Junior, devouring him. The bugs rejoice that their hive has been saved and pay tribute to the fallen Bugette.\n\nThe Overqueen appoints Bug as an ambassador between Bug-World and other planets, but Bug decides to seek out his Ranger friends to see if he still deserves the job. The starship crew lays Bug's human body to rest. Bug shows his true self to them and February, who loves him despite her distaste for bugs, kisses him. Tootsie and Mega-Girl get married, and humans, bugs, and machines all learn to live together in harmony (\"Beauty (Reprise)\").",

He lives in a fantasy world to flee the prison life, the torture, fear and humiliation. His fantasies turn mostly around movies, particularly around a vampy diva, Aurora. He loves her in all roles, but one role scares him: the spider woman, who kills with her kiss.\n\nOne day, a new man is brought into his cell: Valentin Arregui Paz, a Marxist revolutionary, already in a bad state of health after torture. Molina cares for him and tells him of Aurora. But Valentin can't stand Molina and his theatrical fantasies and draws a line on the floor to stop Molina from coming nearer to him. Molina, however, continues talking, mostly to block out the cries of the tortured prisoners, about Aurora and his mother. Valentin at last tells Molina that he (Valentin) is in love with a girl named Marta.\n\nAgain, Valentin is tortured. Again, Molina has to care for him afterwards. In his fantasies, Aurora is next to him, helping him do so.\n\nThe prison director announces to Molina that his mother is very ill and that Molina will be allowed to see her on one condition: he must tell them the name of Valentin's girlfriend.\n\nMolina tells Valentin about a man he loves, a waiter named Gabriel, who does not return his feelings, and the two men cautiously begin to bond. Only a short while afterwards, Molina gets hallucinations and cramps after knowingly eating poisoned food intended for Valentin. He is brought to the hospital ward, talking to his mother and to the Spider Woman. As Molina is brought back, Valentin starts suffering from the same symptoms, also from poisoned food. Molina is afraid that Valentin will be given substances that might make him talk and so protects Valentin from being taken to the hospital.  As Molina nurses him, Valentin asks him to tell him about his movies. Molina is happy to do so; Valentin also shares his fantasies and hopes with Molina.\n\nMolina is allowed a short telephone conversation with his mother, and he announces to Valentin that he's going to be freed for his good behaviour the next day. Valentin begs him to make a few telephone calls for him. Molina at first refuses, but Valentin persuades him with sex. Molina is brought back the next day, heavily injured. He has been caught in the telephone call, but refuses to tell whom he has phoned. The warden draws his pistol, threatening to shoot him, if he doesn't tell. Molina confesses his love to Valentin and is shot. The scene then shifts to Molina in a heaven-like world, where all of the people in his life are watching his final \"movie.\" The Spider Woman arrives and gives her deadly kiss as the curtain falls.",

The original London cast album featured several of the original Paris stars, but only preserved a fraction of the score in English.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe story is set in Paris in the year 1482. The poet Gringoire , who throughout the story acts not only as a participant but also as a sort of commentator, enters to set the scene for the story; he relates how Man has written his history in the building of the cathedrals (\"Le temps des cath\u00e9drales\").\n\nThe homeless and refugees, led by Clopin , swarm before the entrance to the Cathedral of Notre Dame begging for help and sanctuary (\"Les sans-papiers\"). Frollo , the Archdeacon of Notre Dame, orders Phoebus , the Captain of the Royal Archers, to have his men disperse the crowd (\"Intervention de Frollo\"). As his men are driving off the refugees, Phoebus catches sight of the beautiful Romani girl Esmeralda (in later productions, the scene changes to have him see her while she is dancing before Notre Dame) and is entranced by her. Esmeralda tells him about herself, her life as a traveller, and her dreams (\"Boh\u00e9mienne\"). Instead of arresting her, Phoebus leaves her alone.\n\nClopin, who has watched over Esmeralda since she was eight years old after the death of her parents, tells her that she is no longer a child and that she has reached the age where she will discover love (\"Esmeralda tu sais\"). He warns her to be extremely careful, since not all men are to be trusted.\n\nIn the next number, the audience is introduced to the nobly-born and beautiful Fleur-de-Lys, to whom Phoebus is engaged to be married. Fleur-de-Lys's love for Phoebus is childish and irrational, like that of Juliet for Romeo (\"Ces diamants-l\u00e0\").\n\nNow begins the wild and coloured Feast of Fools, presided over by Gringoire (\"La f\u00eate des fous\"), the climax of which is the choosing of the King of Fools from among the group of people who can make the ugliest face; the King will be crowned by Esmeralda. Hiding in the shadows is a monstrous figure who is dragged out into the light; it is the bell-ringer of Notre Dame, the hunchbacked and facially deformed Quasimodo . By unanimous decision, Quasimodo is chosen and crowned as the King of Fools, but he knows that for all the power he has this one day nothing can make a woman such as Esmeralda care for him (\"Le pape des fous\").\n\nFrollo breaks up the festivities and orders Quasimodo to kidnap Esmeralda and bring her to him that night so that she can be imprisoned as a sorceress and a violator of public decency (\"La sorci\u00e8re\"). Quasimodo, who is devoted to Frollo for raising and educating him after he had been abandoned as a baby (\"L'enfant trouv\u00e9\"), says he will obey.\n\nNight falls on Paris with its dark and hidden secrets commented on by Gringoire (\"Les portes de paris\"). Quasimodo stalks Esmeralda through the dark streets and is about to seize her when Phoebus and his guards arrive and arrest Quasimodo. Phoebus introduces himself to Esmeralda. He makes a date for a rendezvous with her the next night at the Cabaret du Val d'Amour. Phoebus and his men take Quasimodo away and Esmeralda darts off into the darkness (\"Tentative d'enl\u00e8vement\").\n\nAt the Court of the Miracles, the haven for all of the outcasts of Paris, Clopin presides over a wild revel, remarking that all are truly equal here no matter their race, religion, skin color or criminal background (\"La cour des miracles\"). Gringoire, who has wandered in accidentally, is seized and Clopin tells him that he will be hanged for his trespassing \u2013 unless one of the women will agree to marry him. Esmeralda who has arrived during this, agrees to marry Gringoire (in name only) and Clopin, as King of the Outcasts, unites them and they join in the wild revelry.\n\nLater, when Gringoire and Esmeralda are left alone (\"Le mot Phoebus\") he introduces himself to her as \"the Prince of the Streets of Paris\" and assures her that while he is not a \"ladies' man\" (\"un homme \u00e0 femmes\"), he would be glad if she would be his Muse and inspiration. Since Gringoire is educated, Esmeralda asks him what the word \"Phoebus\" means; he tells her that in Latin it means \"the sun\" or \"sun god\". Esmeralda muses on the word as it romantically relates to the man Phoebus (\"Beau comme le soleil\"); she is joined on stage by Fleur-de-Lys, who also muses on Phoebus (although she seems to be more apprehensive about him), but both believe that Phoebus will love them forever.\n\nPhoebus himself is under no apprehensions about what kind of man he is \u2013 he wants both women, one as a wife and one as a temporary mistress (\"D\u00e9chir\u00e9\").\n\nThe next day, Frollo summons Gringoire to Notre Dame and questions him about Esmeralda, forbidding him to touch her. Gringoire changes the conversation by asking about a strange inscription in Greek on the wall of the Galerie des Rois in Notre Dame, the word \"Anank\u00e9\". Frollo tells him that \"Anank\u00e9\" means \"Fate\" in Greek. They watch as Quasimodo is dragged on stage bound on the Great Wheel as sentence for his attempted kidnapping of Esmeralda (\"Anarkia\").\n\nQuasimodo endures his punishment, but cries out for water (\"A boire\"), a plea that is ignored by everyone. Suddenly Esmeralda appears and gives him a drink of water from her cup, an act of kindness that deeply touches the poor hunchback. He is then released from the Wheel, and he, Frollo and Phoebus sing about their different feelings for Esmeralda (\" Belle \"): Quasimodo about his growing feelings of tenderness for her, Frollo about his growing fascination for her, and Phoebus (watched jealously by Fleur-de-Lys) about his wish for an affair with her before he marries Fleur-de-Lys.\n\nQuasimodo leads Esmeralda into Notre Dame and tells her how the cathedral has been his home and sanctuary, and now it can be hers whenever she needs one (\"Ma maison c'est ta maison\"). In spite of her initial fear of this strange, deformed man, Esmeralda is touched by his gentleness and finds herself warming towards Quasimodo. Left alone, Esmeralda, who has never prayed before, prays to the Virgin Mary (\"Ave Maria pa\u00efen\"), while Quasimodo thinks of her (\"Si tu pouvais voir en moi\"). Frollo, secretly spying on Esmeralda, realizes that his lust for her will destroy him, but knows that he cannot resist nor does he want to (\"Tu vas me d\u00e9truire\").\n\nThat night, Phoebus is on his way to the Cabaret du Val d\u2019Amour for his rendezvous with Esmeralda when he realizes he is being stalked by a shadowy figure. The figure (Frollo in disguise) warns him to go no further (\"L'ombre\"), but Phoebus refuses to heed the threat and continues on his way.\n\nAt Val d\u2019Amour, Gringoire (who seems to be a regular customer) remarks how everyone, no matter the race, creed or color, comes here for a good time of one kind or another ... for a very low price (\"Le Val d\u2019Amour\"). Phoebus arrives (he seems to be a regular customer here too) and meets Esmeralda in a private room (\"La volupt\u00e9\"). They embrace and are about to make love when Frollo rushes in and stabs Phoebus with Esmeralda's knife (which she had placed on the floor earlier). Esmeralda collapses over Phoebus\u2019 body, Frollo makes his escape and Gringoire, Clopin, Frollo, Quasimodo and the Chorus comment on the terrible power of Fate (\"Fatalit\u00e9\").\n\n### Act II\n\nFrollo and Gringoire discuss the events and scientific discoveries taking place and how some of them (such as Johannes Gutenberg \u2019s printing press and Martin Luther \u2019s doctrines ) are changing the world forever (\"Florence\"). Gringoire notices how silent the cathedral is and Frollo tells him that Quasimodo has not rung the bells for three days.\n\nUp in the bell tower, Quasimodo recounts how the cathedral bells are his only friends and loves (\"Les cloches\"), especially the three \"Maries\": \"Little Marie\" which is rung for children's funerals, \"Big Marie\" which is rung when ships set sail and \"Great Marie\" which is rung for weddings. His greatest hope is that they will ring for Esm\u00e9ralda to hear that he loves her.\n\nFrollo asks Gringoire where his \"wife\" is (\"O\u00f9 est Elle?\"); Gringoire says he does not know and answers obliquely (but he tells Clopin, who has been searching for Esmeralda, that she has been imprisoned in the prison of La Sant\u00e9 and that she will be hanged if Clopin doesn't save her).\n\nIn her cell, Esmeralda compares herself to a caged bird and calls to Quasimodo to save her, while back at Notre Dame Quasimodo wonders about Esmeralda's disappearance three days earlier and fears for her safety (\"Les oiseaux qu'on met en cage\"). Clopin and a group of outcasts are arrested and thrown into the La Sant\u00e9 prison (\"Condamn\u00e9s\") as Esmeralda is put on trial for the attempted murder of Phoebus and sorcery with Frollo as presiding judge (\"Le proc\u00e8s\" / \"La torture\"); when she refuses to confess, she is subjected to a foot-crushing torture until she cries out \"I confess!\" Frollo sentences her to death by hanging, but Esmeralda still professes her love for Phoebus and Frollo is left to suffer from the emotional torment of his unrequited passion (\"\u00catre pr\u00eatre et aimer une femme\"). Esmeralda calls Phoebus to save her (\u201cPhoebus\u201d)\n\nElsewhere, a recovered Phoebus is confronted by Fleur-de-Lys, but he claims as an excuse that he was bewitched by Esmeralda's \"sorcery\" (\"Je reviens vers toi\"). Fleur-de-Lys tells him that he will still have her heart and love if he will swear to have Esmeralda executed (\"La monture\").\n\nAt five o'clock in the morning of the execution, Frollo visits Esm\u00e9ralda's cell and to her horror confesses to her that he knifed Phoebus out of love for her (\"Visite de Frollo a Esmeralda\" / \"Un matin tu dansais\") and offers her a choice: death on the gallows or life by giving him love. When Esmeralda rejects his advances, he tries to rape her, but Quasimodo (who has secretly followed him) frees Clopin and the other prisoners. Clopin attacks Frollo, knocking him unconscious, and releases Esm\u00e9ralda and they flee the prison to Notre Dame for sanctuary (\"Lib\u00e9r\u00e9s\").\n\nGringoire sings to the moon (\"Lune\") in which he describes Quasimodo's pain and suffering because of his love for Esm\u00e9ralda.\n\nQuasimodo leaves Esmeralda asleep in a safe place in Notre Dame (\"Je te laisse un sifflet\"), but bitterly reflects that while he will love her forever, his ugliness will ensure that she will never love him (\"Dieu que le monde est injuste\"). Alone, Esmeralda hopes that she will survive for the man she loves and sings about how Love has the power to change the world even should she die (\" Vivre \").\n\nWith Clopin and his people occupying Notre Dame, Frollo orders Phoebus and his men to break sanctuary and attack the cathedral to drive them out (\"L\u2019Attaque de Notre Dame\"). Clopin and his people resist bravely but are no match for the armed soldiers, and in the first attack Clopin is fatally wounded. Dying, he begs Esmeralda to take his place as leader. The final battle has Esmeralda and her people facing off against Phoebus and his soldiers, but the result is a foregone conclusion \u2013 Esmeralda is captured and the outcasts defeated. Phoebus coldbloodedly hands Esmeralda over to be executed, orders the outcasts driven out of Paris (\"D\u00e9port\u00e9s\") and leaves with Fleur-de-Lys.\n\nQuasimodo, searching Notre Dame for Esmeralda, finds Frollo standing at the top of one of the towers and begs him to help Esmeralda (\"Mon ma\u00eetre, mon sauveur\"). Frollo, finally driven insane, shows him the sight of Esmeralda being hanged and to Quasimodo's horror announces that he is responsible. As he laughs wildly, the enraged Quasimodo seizes him and hurls him down the stairs of the tower to his death. As the executioners are cutting down Esmeralda's body from the gibbet, Quasimodo appears and demands that they give him her body (\"Donnez-la moi\"). Driving them away, he kneels beside her body and mourns her, promising to stay with her and that even in death they will not be parted (\"Danse, mon Esmeralda\").\n\nAfter the curtain call, Gringoire leads the cast in a reprise of \"Le temps des cath\u00e9drales\".",

        "synopsis": "Jewish alcoholic Davey Stone's criminal record has earned him animosity in his hometown of Dukesberry, New Hampshire . Taken to court for his recent activity on the first night of Hanukkah , Whitey Duvall, a diminutive and eccentric aging volunteer referee from Davey's former youth basketball league, convinces the judge to have him do community service as a referee-in-training for the league. The judge agrees, but warns that if Davey commits another crime before his tenure at the league concludes, he will be sentenced to ten years in prison .\n\nAs Davey harasses the players at his first game, Whitey has a seizure and the game is abruptly halted with Davey forfeiting it to the opposing team. Attempting to calm Davey down, Whitey takes him to the local mall, where they meet Davey's childhood crush Jennifer Friedman, now a divorcee who has moved back to Dukesberry and taken a job there, and her preadolescent son Benjamin. Davey still secretly harbors feelings for Jennifer, but Whitey reminds Davey that he blew his chance with her years ago.\n\nWhitey's various attempts to encourage Davey are repeatedly met with humiliation and assault. Later, Davey bonds with Benjamin while playing basketball at the community center, but Benjamin's unsportsman-like behavior, encouraged by Davey, earns him the ire of Jennifer. On their respective rides home, Davey and Jennifer reminisce about their happy childhood together and how much things have changed. Davey returns home to find his trailer being burned down by one of the men whom he beat earlier in the basketball game. After retrieving a Hanukkah card from his late parents, Whitey invites Davey to stay with him and his diabetic twin sister Eleanore; Davey reluctantly accepts. The siblings explain the complex rules of their household, threatening to evict Davey if he does not abide.\n\nDavey slowly starts to improve himself, until one day Whitey recalls Davey's past\u2014en route to one of Davey's basketball games, Davey's parents died in a car accident, which he learned of shortly after winning the game. Davey spent the rest of his childhood in and out of foster facilities and state homes, numbing his pain with alcoholism and petty crime during his adolescence and ostracizing himself from Jennifer and his other friends. Enraged after being reminded of his trauma, Davey insults the Duvalls, resulting in a heartbroken Whitey evicting him.\n\nDavey spends the rest of the day binge-drinking. That night, he breaks into the closed mall and hallucinates the mascots of various stores coming to life and confronting him about his inability to grieve. He finally opens the Hanukkah card, which contains a heartfelt message asking him not to change who he is, and allows himself to cry over the loss of his parents. When the police arrive to arrest him, Davey escapes and boards a bus to New York City , but the bus is forced to stop when a thumbtack in the road punctures all rear tires. Reminded of the Miracle of Hanukkah, Davey sets out to make amends with Whitey.\n\nDavey finds Whitey at the All-Star Banquet, an annual town celebration in which one member of the community is recognized for positive contributions with the \"Dukesberry All-Star Patch\", which Whitey has wanted for thirty-five years. When Whitey is passed over again, he resolves to move to Florida to live the remainder of his life in anonymity. Davey arrives and reminds the townspeople of the abuse they have all heaped upon Whitey throughout his life and the selfless contributions he has made to the community in spite of that. Davey leads them to the mall, where Whitey is with Eleanore. The townspeople thank Whitey for his service over the years and the mayor officially grants him the Patch; previous recipients give him theirs as well. As Davey and Jennifer reconcile, Whitey has another seizure that he enjoys.",

        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nThe musical opens on Broadway, where Eleanor!: The Eleanor Roosevelt Story is celebrating its opening night with its lead cast members Dee Dee Allen and Barry Glickman (\"Changing Lives\"). The musical is bashed by The New York Times because Dee Dee and Barry are self-absorbed narcissists who do not understand their characters, and the show closes the same night. To improve their image, the actors decide to take up \"a cause\" that will make them appear selfless. They team up with two other washed-up actors \u2014 Trent Oliver, a Juilliard School graduate down on his luck who has just been cast in the non-Equity tour of Godspell , and Angie Dickinson, a life-long chorus girl who just quit after 20 years in the musical Chicago . Searching on Twitter, they find Emma, an Indiana teenager whose prom has been cancelled because she wanted to bring her girlfriend as her date. Seizing the opportunity, the actors decide to go to Indiana to help (\"Changing Lives (Reprise)\").\n\nIn Indiana, Emma faces bullying, but she reminds herself that not everyone is this cruel (\"Just Breathe\"). Mr. Hawkins, the school principal and Emma's ally, informs her that he has spoken to the state attorney general in hopes of reinstating the prom. The school holds a meeting with the homophobic PTA, but just as Emma and Mr. Hawkins begin to make progress, Dee Dee, Barry, Angie, and Trent barge in with protest signs in support of Emma. Dee Dee reminds everyone what a good person she is for doing this while claiming that this isn't about herself. Emma feels humiliated (\"It's Not About Me\"). After the meeting, it is revealed that the girl Emma wants to take to prom is Alyssa, a popular but closeted student and the daughter of Mrs. Greene, the head of the PTA. The two argue as Alyssa blames Emma for all the publicity around the prom but Emma reassures her that she didn't want this and just wants to be with her (\"Dance with You\"). The actors attempt to hold a rally to inspire action for Emma but can only book the halftime show at a monster truck rally. They perform alongside the non-Equity tour cast of Godspell (\"The Acceptance Song\"). Their performance is unsuccessful as the crowd boos them offstage.\n\nThe attorney general orders the PTA to organize a new prom. Emma thanks the actors, and Mr. Hawkins and Dee Dee go to Applebee's to celebrate, while students begin to \" prompose \" to each other. Emma invites Alyssa to the prom, and she agrees, promising to come out to be with her (\"You Happened\"). At Applebee's, Mr. Hawkins, a huge fan of Dee Dee's, tells her how much she inspires him (\"We Look to You\"). Barry helps Emma get ready for the prom and reveals he didn't have the opportunity to go to prom either after running away from home. Meanwhile, across town, other teens prepare for the prom (\"Tonight Belongs to You\"). As Emma waits outside the gym, she asks Barry to walk her in because she is nervous. As they enter, they realize that the school gym is empty. Mr. Hawkins, who is inside desperately trying to resolve the issue, reveals that the PTA lied to him and have secretly moved the prom across town. Dee Dee panics that the fake prom will be bad press for her, which angers Mr. Hawkins as he realizes Dee Dee's true intentions. Emma calls Alyssa who tells her she knew nothing about the other prom. Emma asks her to come and be with her, but she refuses to come out. Devastated, Emma runs out of the gym, asking all the actors to just go home.\n\n### Act Two\n\nFollowing the fake prom, the media frenzy around the whole event increases. The actors encourage Emma to step up and become the face of the story, but she is too scared. Angie encourages her with a quick lesson about \"zazz\", which she complements with a story about Bob Fosse and the original production of Chicago (\"Zazz\"). Dee Dee returns to talk to Mr. Hawkins, who berates her for being so self-centered. She performs his favorite song to make it up to him and vows to begin thinking of others (\"The Lady's Improving\"). Trent decides that he may be able to change the minds of the youth of the town due to his small-town upbringing. He confronts a number of the students about how they and their families break the word of the Bible every day and how hypocritical they are being. He encourages them to follow \"love thy neighbor\" above all (\"Love Thy Neighbor\").\n\nAlyssa meets with Emma to apologize, telling her about all the pressure her mother puts on her to be perfect and how she blames Alyssa for her father leaving. Emma is unable to accept her apology and they break up (\"Alyssa Greene\"). The actors book Emma a TV appearance, but she turns it down and tells them that she has her own plan to control the narrative and change minds. Convinced her plan will work and that they will be able to have a prom for everyone, Emma asks Barry to be her date so that he is finally able to fulfill his dream. Barry, overjoyed, agrees as he recounts his experience missing his own prom (\"Barry Is Going to Prom\"). Emma uploads a video of her singing with her guitar about her struggles and longing for acceptance, but how despite that she is proud of who she is and won't hide anymore. She inspires other members of the LGBTQ+ community in the area and across the country to comment on their support for her and how it has helped them (\"Unruly Heart\"). The video goes viral, inspiring the actors to plan an inclusive prom for Emma and all the LGBTQ+ kids across the state. However, Mr. Hawkins realizes that the school doesn't have enough money to pay for it.\n\nThe actors all donate, including Dee Dee, who turns over her American Express Black card. The PTA attempts to block the new prom but are stopped from doing so when the students voice their support, thanks to Trent's efforts to change their minds. The students suggest Trent stay in Indiana and become their drama teacher. Alyssa comes out to her mother in front of the school, confessing her love for Emma. Mrs. Greene is reluctant to accept Alyssa as she is, but Barry steps in, saying if she doesn't accept Alyssa, she is going to lose her. She is devastated but begins to become more open and agrees to listen to her daughter. The PTA backs down, and quickly makes plans for a new prom, while Dee Dee and Barry question what \"success\" is. The school puts on this more inclusive prom and LGBTQ+ couples from the area attend, along with the straight couples of James Madison High School. Emma and Alyssa finally get their dance and share a kiss (\"It's Time to Dance\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nMr. Jacob Jankowski, an elderly Polish-American man living in an assisted living home, visits O\u2019Brien\u2019s One-Ring Circus before it heads out of town. He reveals to the employees that he worked with circus animals in his youth. He reminisces on his first circus job. During the Great Depression , Jacob hops a train \"going anywhere.\" Camel, an older circus worker, and Wade, the foreman, try to intimidate him off the train, but he stands his ground. Camel reveals to Jacob that the train belongs to the \"Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth\" (\"Anywhere/Another Train\"). Jacob is hired for one day\u2019s work and will leave after their next stop (\"The Road Don\u2019t Make You Young\").\n\nJacob walks in on Marlena, the star performer, comforting her horse, Silver Star (\"Easy\"). Jacob, who studied veterinary medicine at Cornell, shows August, the ringmaster and Marlena\u2019s husband, that the horse is foundering and may need to be euthanized. After hearing that Jacob was studying to be a doctor before being forced to drop out of school, August offers Jacob a job as the circus vet if he is able to keep Silver Star working. August takes Jacob to the menagerie and tricks Jacob into getting attacked by a toothless lion - he boasts that nothing at his circus is real as people only want to see spectacular illusions instead of the grim reality (\"The Lion Has Got No Teeth\"). Later that night it's revealed that Wade \"red-lighted\" another circus worker on August\u2019s command, throwing him off the train. Camel warns Jacob of the dangers of the circus, but Jacob decides to stay because he has nowhere else to go (\"I Choose the Ride\").\n\nJacob ultimately has to put Silver Star down as the injury has progressed beyond saving. When the circus arrives at the no-longer-in-business Fox Brothers Train, August plans on buying a horse to replace Silver Star. However, all that remains is an old elephant, Rosie (\"Ode to an Elephant\"). Jacob and Marlena struggle to train Rosie (\"Just Our Luck\"), and August, unsatisfied with their progress, begins to abuse Rosie with a bullhook . Marlena tells Jacob that August is prone to fits of rage (\"I Shouldn\u2019t Be Surprised\").\n\nJacob, Marlena, and August spend the evening at a speakeasy. Jacob tells them that he had been studying to be a doctor to follow in his father's footsteps and his father had even ordered a sign reading \"Jankowski and Son\" to put over their practice, but he and Jacob's mother were killed in a car accident before he could pass his final exams. Jacob had hopped the train because the bank had confiscated his childhood home as well as his father's practice, so he was leaving the city to start a new life. Marlena empathizes with Jacob's story as she had run away from her family to marry August. Jealous of the tender moment, August becomes violent again, this time towards Marlena. When the speakeasy is raided, Jacob and Marlena escape from the police together. Outside of the speakeasy, they share a moment, and Jacob kisses Marlena. Marlena runs away, and Jacob revels in his thrilling situation (\"Silver Stars\").\n\nIn Chicago, Marlena and Rosie are set to make their debut as the star act, but Rosie refuses to move, forcing August to improvise. Furious, August prepares to beat her with his bullhook when Rosie swipes August down with her trunk. She is about to kill him when Jacob instinctively yells zosta\u0144 , the Polish word for \"stop\". Rosie, whose previous trainer was Polish, understands the language and can now follow Jacob\u2019s commands. The circus celebrates finally being \"back in business\" (\"The Grand Spec\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nMr. Jankowski reminisces on his younger days spent with Rosie (\"Funny Angel\"). With Rosie as their new star, The Benzini Brothers Circus becomes a success. As Jacob teaches the circus workers Polish, he grows increasingly close with Marlena (\"Zosta\u0144\"). This draws the eye of circus workers Barbara, Walter, and Camel, who convince Jacob that a relationship with Marlena will bring nothing but trouble (\"Squeaky Wheel\").\n\nJacob plans to leave the circus to Marlena\u2019s dismay - August grows suspicious of their relationship. He accuses Marlena of cheating on him and Marlena and August exchange blows (\"You\u2019ve Got Nothing (Part 1)\"). August orders Wade to red-light Jacob, Walter and Camel. Jacob and Marlena disappear, and a reluctant Wade pushes Walter and Camel off the train as it\u2019s going over a bridge, killing them (\"You\u2019ve Got Nothing (Part 2)\").\n\nIn a hotel room, Marlena regrets how poorly she let people treat her, but resolves to trust herself from now on (\"What Do You Do\"). Jacob finds Marlena, and they are free to be together for the first time (\"Wild\"). They form a plan: They will go back to the show, perform the first half, then run off with Rosie, Camel, and Walter while August finishes the show. When they arrive at the circus, Jacob goes to Walter and Camel's compartment, but only finds Walter's pet dog Queenie. Wade walks in on him and Jacob realizes what happened. The two end up fighting until Wade smacks Jacob's head against a post and runs off. When he comes to his senses, Jacob takes a knife and resolves to kill August as he takes a nap before the show (\"Go Home\"), but can\u2019t go through with it.\n\nDuring the show, a guilt-ridden Wade opens the menagerie cages, and the animals stampede the circus. Many people die, including August, who is killed by Rosie wielding his bullhook. Being the only person to see this, Jacob contemplates whether his indecision to try and stop Rosie was him being frozen with fear or a deliberate desire to let August die. Jacob and Marlena make it out alive and soon after got married, keeping Rosie and Queenie in their care. Jacob went on to pass his exams and they had five children, allowing Jacob to finally hang the sign his father had ordered before he eventually retired and left the practice in the hands of his children. After revealing that Marlena died not too long ago, Mr. Jankowski decides that he misses the circus life, and accepts a job at O\u2019Brien\u2019s One-Ring Circus, jokingly telling Marlena's spirit that he's running away with the circus before declaring that he's finally home (\"Finale (I choose the ride)\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe show begins with the ensemble dancing around a figure playing ancient drums (\"Fire\"). Molag, the narrator, speaks to the audience about fire and brings them back in time to tell the story of its invention (\"We Are People Now\"). In this time, a prolonged intellectual disagreement known as The Great Debate between Smelly-Balls and Chorn is causing chaos in a small tribe of early Homo sapiens . Their leader, Jemilla, steps in and solves it by encouraging Smelly-Balls to change his perspective, earning her the title 'Peacemaker'. The tribe then receives a blessing from their deity, a duck known as the Almighty Duck, and Jemilla encourages them to resume their work. However, a tribe member named Zazzalil pleads for a day off to sing and practice dancing , which has just been invented. Though Zazzalil resists, Jemilla and the rest of the tribe assert that the work must be done (\"We Got Work to Do\"). While the rest of the tribe perform their jobs, Jemilla meets with Molag, the tribe's former leader. Molag reveals that the duck the tribe worships is but one of many ducks that Molag has captured and used to control the tribe during her time as leader. She also reveals Tiblyn's duty of holding up the sky is unnecessary and useless. Jemilla is severely shaken by these revelations.\n\nZazzalil and her crony Keeri find Jemilla in her moment of desperation and present an idea to start eating squirrels , instead of their current food staples of nuts and berries . Jemilla tells them to stop thinking of such things and focus on their job, collecting nuts. Zazzalil resents Jemilla's rules and thinks she's holding her back (\"What If?\"). Zazzalil then has an idea for another invention when she realizes that a sharp stone Keeri found can pierce the skin and potentially kill animals (\"Welcome to the Stone Age\"). After watching a performance of the single joke in the repertoire of the inventor of comedy , Jemilla's wife Schwoopsie, Tiblyn, and Emberly come upon an intruder named Grunt. Though scared at first, Emberly stops Grunt from eating a poisonous berry and gives him a sandwich she invented (\"Just a Taste\"). They almost kiss, but Jemilla and the rest of the tribe chase Grunt away since he is an outsider. Jemilla then decides to reveal what Molag taught her, that the duck is not a god and Tiblyn's holding her arms towards the sky is not preventing it from falling. The supreme wizard Ducker claims Jemilla is just a heretic , but is proven wrong when Tiblyn drops her arms, and nothing happens. Ducker removes his wizard hat and the duck flies away. Everyone is dismayed by the shattering of their false ideas, especially Tiblyn and Ducker.\n\nZazzalil then arrives with her new invention, a spear . She attempts to test it on Keeri, but Jemilla stops her. She then attempts to test it on a mammoth named Trunkell (Lauren Walker/Joey Richter) that killed her parents but misses and angers Trunkell. The mammoth chases the tribe up a tree and intimidates them to stay there until nightfall, when Trunkell leaves and the tribe must return to their cave to avoid Snarl, a bloodthirsty Smilodon (\"The Night Belongs to Snarl\"). While the rest of the tribe continues to struggle with a seemingly godless world, Zazzalil leaves the cave to kill Trunkell and prove that the spear does work (\"Into the Night\"). The tribe chases after her and find her entering a cave containing a sleeping creature who turns out to be not Trunkell, but Snarl. A bolt of lightning hits the end of Zazzalil's spear and creates a torch which she uses to scare off Snarl. The tribe is amazed by the new invention, which Chorn calls fire, and Zazzalil uses their new respect for her to convince them to banish Jemilla. Jemilla warns them that the fire is dangerous and leaves. The tribe worships Zazzalil as the Firebringer (\"The Night Belongs to Us\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe tribe, now led by Zazzalil, marvel over how fire has improved their lives \u2013 they have moved out of the cave and kill mammoths so that they no longer go hungry (\"Climate Change\"). The fire, however, is revealed to have a negative effect as well \u2013 it distracts the tribe members from interacting with each other. In addition, Keeri tells Zazzalil that she thinks the mammoths have gone extinct from overhunting, and that the extra meat they dump in the watering hole has poisoned all of the water. Zazzalil encourages her not to worry but Keeri thinks she is turning into a monster. Jemilla, in exile, admits to herself that perhaps her reluctance to accept new ideas was wrong (\"Jemilla's Lament\"), when suddenly a man (Clark Baxtresser) from another tribe appears and leads her to his tribe's village.\n\nGrunt manages to find Emberly in her new village and shows her his paintings , then paints a portrait of her (\"Paint Me\"). Meanwhile, Ducker attempts to reestablish his former power as the duck priest by saying he can interpret the wishes of fire, which is now revered. He asks the tribe to light his hat on fire, which he claims will not burn him and prove that he is the fire's vessel on earth. He catches on fire and quickly sets the whole village ablaze (\"Ouch My Butt\"), after which the fire dies out. Everyone blames Zazzalil; Keeri says that Jemilla was right to call the fire dangerous, and that Zazzalil is a bad leader. Suddenly, Snarl appears, and snatches Grunt back to his lair. Emberly entreats the tribe to help her get Grunt back, and they all agree to help her. Emberly comes up with a plan to defeat Snarl \u2013 she paints fire on a stone tablet using her feces and hopes that the image of fire will drive him off. Though Zazzalil begs them not to go, saying it's a bad plan, the tribe follows Emberly to save Grunt.\n\nZazzalil laments her mistakes (\"Backfire\") and is visited by the man from the other tribe who, upon hearing her name, brings her back to his tribe. There she finds that Jemilla is the new leader of this tribe. Zazzalil begs her to return, admitting that she is a better leader, but Jemilla refuses as in this new tribe she has many attractive husbands and wives ('played by' the audience) and two children. Zazzalil promises to marry Jemilla if she returns, but Jemilla still refuses. Eventually they both confess their wrongdoings to each other and admit they're more alike than they thought. Jemilla finally agrees to return, saying goodbye to her husbands, wives, and children. Jemilla tells Zazzalil that she will hold her to the marriage promise, and they celebrate how much more they can accomplish (\"Together\"). Jemilla resolves to help save Grunt and the tribe and tells Zazzalil they need to make more spears.\n\nThe rest of the tribe finds Grunt in Snarl's lair, but Grunt's feet and one of his arms have already been eaten. Snarl is asleep, leading the tribe to believe that they can rescue Grunt and leave without having to deal with the predator. However, Jemilla and Zazzalil enter the cave loudly and cause Snarl to reawaken. When Emberly's plan to wave the painting at him doesn't work, Jemilla and Zazzalil attempt to stab Snarl through the eyes with their spears. They both miss and hit their spears against the cave wall, creating sparks. Zazzalil realizes this is how fire is made and bangs the sharpened stones from their spears together, creating a fire that sets Snarl ablaze, killing him. Jemilla congratulates Zazzalil for making fire and the tribe is in awe. Suddenly, Chorn reveals itself to be an alien of a species that seeded life on Earth. It was charged with testing humanity and declares the lightning bolt that hit Zazzalil's spear to make the first fire was actually a photon beam from its ship. It admonishes the tribe not to let new inventions make them arrogant, and restores Grunt's arm, though it is incapable of doing the same to his feet. It then gives the whole tribe its vast alien knowledge including the future of all humanity (\"Chorn\"), sending them into spasms. When the tribe awakens, they sing and dance; Zazzalil and Jemilla propose to each other, and Jemilla promises to give new ideas a try before dismissing them. The tribe finds comfort in their larger understanding of the world (\"Finale\").",

The musical follows and is based upon the true-life story of 16-year-old British schoolboy Jamie Campbell , as he overcomes prejudice and bullying to step out of the darkness and become a drag queen .",
        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nMiss Hedge, a careers teacher, asks her noisy year eleven class what they want to be when they get older. One student of the class (16), Jamie New, gets teased about his homosexuality and reveals to the audience all he wants to be is a drag queen (\"And You Don't Even Know It\"). When prompted, Jamie tells the class he wants to be a performer, but Miss Hedge tells him to get real.\n\nAt Jamie's house, his mother Margaret and family friend Ray are preparing for his 16th birthday. When Jamie arrives home, Margaret gives him a card from his dad, with a picture of a race car. Margaret then gives Jamie his gift from her - a pair of red stilettos from Meadowhall . Jamie reveals hesitation about going outside his garden in the shoes (\"Wall in My Head\").\n\nThe next day at school, Jamie shows his best friend Pritti his new heels, and then he is interrupted by Dean, the school bully. He taunts Pritti for being Muslim , and Jamie for being gay. Jamie taunts Dean; embarrassed, Dean leaves. Pritti encourages Jamie to go to prom in a dress (\"Spotlight\"). Jamie then parades around the classroom in his heels (\"Spotlight (Reprise) (Star of the Show)\").\n\nAt his local shop for drag queen attire, Victor's Secret, Jamie befriends the owner Hugo, and learns all about Hugo's past as a drag queen (\"The Legend of Loco Chanelle (and the Blood Red Dress)\"). Hugo books Jamie's first drag show at the local nightclub, and helps Jamie choose his dress (\"The Legend of Loco Chanelle (and the Blood Red Dress) (Reprise)\").\n\nMeanwhile, Margaret meets with Jamie's dad, where she reveals she has been lying to Jamie about his dad, including the fact she has to write a birthday card from him each birthday. Jamie's dad tells Margaret he wants nothing to do with Jamie, claiming he is not a \"real boy\". Margaret ponders what her life would be like if she never met Jamie's dad (\"If I Met Myself Again\").\n\nAt school, Jamie pulls Pritti into a disabled toilet so she can help with his make-up. They are discovered by Miss Hedge, but Pritti tells her that she is doing Jamie's make-up for an art project. Miss Hedge tells Jamie that he should be proud of being an art project, and walks him around school in the make-up. Jamie, initially embarrassed by the attention, decides to be proud of himself, telling the school that he is doing a drag show at the local nightclub, Legs Eleven, that night (\"Work of Art\").\n\nOutside Legs Eleven, Jamie bumps into Dean, who calls him a minger. Inside the club, Margaret and Ray have been introduced to a group of drag queens: Laika Virgin, Tray Sophisticay, and Sandra Bollock. Hugo emerges, now dressed as Loco Chanelle, his drag alter-ego. Jamie runs in to tell them all he cannot go on because of what Dean said. Jamie finds the dress he admired at Victor's Secret in his dressing room, with a tag on saying \"Love Dad\" as well as a flower delivery from Jamie's dad. Loco Chanelle, with the help of the other drag queens, encourage Jamie to find his drag self, whom Jamie calls Mimi Me (\u201cOver The Top\u201d). As Loco announces Jamie over the sound system, Dean and his mates chant 'minger' as we see Jamie in drag. (\u201cOut Of The Darkness\u201d).\n\n### Act Two\n\nThe next day, the school is buzzing with news of Jamie's drag debut (\"Everybody's Talking About Jamie\"). Jamie comes into school in bright blue eyeshadow and long eyelashes. Miss Hedge once again tells Jamie to \"get real\", and Dean taunts Jamie, but Jamie kisses him in retaliation, leaving Dean confused.\n\nAt home, Jamie shows Margaret and Ray his new prom dress , now shortened and fitted with working flashing lights. Margaret worries if this is all too much (\"Limited Edition Prom Night Special\"). The phone rings, and Jamie and Margaret are called to the school.\n\nJamie, Margaret and Ray go to the school to meet with Miss Hedge, who tells Jamie that there have been rumours that he will be attending prom in drag, and she will not allow it. Jamie is disappointed, and Dean seems to know all about it.\n\nIn Pritti's bedroom, Jamie rants to Pritti about how he is not allowed to go to prom in drag. Pritti tells Jamie to go in a dress - not in drag. Jamie says that without Mimi Me, he is ugly. Pritti reassures Jamie that he is far from ugly (\"It Means Beautiful\"). Jamie reveals that when he was eight, his dad found him in a dress and was angry. He is then confused as to why he paid for the dress and bought flowers if he is not supportive of him as a drag queen. Pritti suggests Jamie should go to his house and speak to him. Before he leaves, Jamie kisses Pritti on the cheek (\"It Means Beautiful (Reprise)\").\n\nAt the house of Jamie's dad, Jamie's dad reveals that he did not know about Mimi Me and calls Jamie disgusting.

Jamie figures out that it was his mother doing all of this in his dad's place (\"Ugly in This Ugly World\").\n\nAt home, Jamie argues with Margaret over why she has been lying over all these years. Jamie screams in Margaret's face and storms out. Margaret, left alone, sings about how she will always love Jamie no matter what (\"He's My Boy\").\n\nJamie wanders the streets drunk on cider.

It was the seventh feature film version of the story of 19th-century Australian bushranger Ned Kelly , and is notable for being the first Kelly film to be shot in colour.\n\nThe film was directed by Tony Richardson , and starred Mick Jagger in the title role. Scottish-born actor Mark McManus played the part of Kelly's friend Joe Byrne. It was a British production, but was filmed entirely in Australia, shot mostly around Braidwood in southern New South Wales , with a largely Australian supporting cast.",
        "synopsis": "The film opens with Ned's last few hours in black and white clips. During this we get our first taste of Mick Jagger as Ned.\n\nWe then see Ned returning home while the first of the films many songs play. Ned eventually settles in to the new home life and gets to know his stepfather. American Gorge King is Ned's stepfather and he is the one responsible for getting Ned back into a life of crime after Ned tries to live a simple honest life. We see Ned doing several activities such as bare knuckle boxing and getting into a fight with half a dozen police. Eventually a drunk police officer comes to the house trying to arrest Ned's brother and Ned has to forcefully remove him from the house.\n\nNed's mother is put on trial and sentenced by judge Barry played by Frank Thring Ned, his brother and two friends go on the run and kill policemen at a creek. As a result they are given a higher bounty on their heads than any other Australian criminals. They then go on to rob a bank at Euroa and rob several more banks. At one of these robberies Ned writes a letter that gives his side of the story and gives the gang multiple sympathisers who the gang later intend to use to their advantage. They then get the idea to construct armour,Ned even says \"The bible says turn your armour into plough shares but I say turn your plough shares into armour!\" They get the idea to kill Aaron who is an old friend of Ned's because he is a traitor and then they hope the police will send a train that will go past Glenrowan and they will damage the tracks and them and their sympathisers will slaughter the survivors.\n\nThey kill Aaron at night and then they get to the hotel in Glenrowan. However the train takes longer than expected and one of the people inside the hotel named Curnow convinces Ned to let him go and Ned lets him. Curnow then warns the train and the police start shooting at the hotel. Ned is shot in the hand and a person in the hotel is accidentally killed. Ned decides to warn the sympathisers and the rest stay behind. One of the gang members is shot and killed and the rest of the people are let free but the police make them all stay on the floor and some are arrested. Ned passes out and in the morning wakes up and walks to the tracks and the police hear him approaching. The remaining 2 gang members shoot themselves off screen and we cut to the middle of the action where Ned is shooting at police on the tracks. This scene is inaccurate as in real life Ned was shooting outside the inn and not on the tracks. Ned eventually is overpowered by the police and falls to the ground after a barrage of bullets. The inn is set on fire and we then see Ned on trial being prosecuted by the same judge that sentenced his mother and Ned is sentenced to death. Ned tells the judge \"I will meet you there\" he is presumably talking about hell or the afterlife.",

To gain access, Max persuades his comrade to exchange army papers, and Georgette allows him in, believing him to be her godson. Partly in revenge for her husband's roving eye and partly because she finds Max attractive, she does not discourage his evident interest in her.\n\nThe sudden arrival of Max's wife sets off a series of impersonations and swapped identities. Max, to avoid discovery by Lucienne, shaves off his moustache and beard and continues to maintain that he is Brichoux. Lucienne is not deceived, and she retaliates by a vigorous flirtation with Colonel Bolinger. To prevent the embarrassment of Georgette's exposure, her husband, Bibi, finds himself having to pose as a servant in his own house, while the Colonel assumes Max is Georgette's husband. Max, meanwhile, has to keep silent while his real wife receives the attentions of the Colonel. The real Brichoux intermittently appears and has to be explained away.\n\nMax, still unaware of Bibi's real identity, finds himself attending an evening event in his company. Bibi's indignation at his position breaks out continually. Eventually, Max confesses to Georgette that he is not her godson, and the chain of imposture unravels.

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nPhil Connors, an arrogant TV weatherman, is dreading his trip to Punxsutawney, PA to report on the annual Groundhog Day Ceremony, believing it is beneath him. As his weather van arrives in town, the people of Punxsutawney are hoping that the groundhog, Punxsutawney Phil, will not see his shadow, signifying an end to winter and the start of spring (\"There Will Be Sun\"). The next morning, Phil wakes on 2 February full of scorn for everything and everyone he encounters on his way to Gobbler's Knob where the annual ceremony takes place. When he arrives on location he meets up with cameraman Larry and his new producer Rita before the groundhog's forecast of six more weeks of winter. While Phil and Rita eat lunch at a diner, Larry packs the van preparing for their departure, and the sheriff enters and tells them that a bad snowstorm has closed every road out of town, keeping them from leaving. Rita makes an entry in her journal before the Groundhog Day banquet and the townspeople remain ever hopeful for the coming spring (\"Day One\").\n\nThe next morning, Phil wakes on 2 February and confusedly relives his morning over again, including a run-in with obnoxious high school classmate Ned Ryerson. Phil begrudgingly reports on the ceremony with the same result as the day before, and Rita enjoys the festivities after commenting in her journal about Phil's odd behavior (\"Day Two\"). The next morning, Phil wakes on 2 February and fearing a mental breakdown (\"Day Three\"), consults every doctor and healer in town, none of whom is medically qualified, and all of whom suggest a variety of unusual remedies (\"Stuck\"). Phil decides to self-medicate at the bar instead, and finds camaraderie with two drunks who are stuck in a rut and feel that life is repetitive. The trio takes advantage of not having a future and drive recklessly on train tracks, evading the police before they are eventually caught and Phil is arrested (\"Nobody Cares\").\n\nThe next morning, Phil wakes on 2 February with a newfound joy as he openly treats others terribly, does as he pleases, and uses his repeated days to meet and reintroduce himself to Nancy Taylor, a local woman that he eventually manages to sleep with (\"Philandering\"). After settling into a hedonistic groove, Phil sets his sights on Rita, determined to sleep with her. He spends several days trying to manufacture her perfect date, and grows more manic as he invariably keeps failing. With success never in sight, Phil wonders why he couldn't repeat a better day, Rita wonders if she'll ever find someone she could love, and the townspeople wonder if they will ever do all the things they've been putting off, waiting for an idealized future (\"One Day\").\n\n### Act II\n\nNancy contemplates her behaviour patterns and how she presents herself (\"Playing Nancy\"). Phil arrives at Gobbler's Knob for his broadcast and interrupts his report to shoot Punxsutawney Phil and then himself. The next morning, Phil wakes on 2 February and exhausts every way to kill himself, vowing not to give up that he will one day successfully commit suicide and or escape from the time loop (\"Hope\"). Phil returns to the diner and with nothing to lose, tells Rita what is happening, proving his claims by spouting off facts about the townspeople, predicting their actions, and finally telling Rita things he has learned about her (\"Everything About You\"). Intrigued, Rita spends the day with Phil, learning various things he's done about town and theorizing what she would do in his shoes (\"If I Had My Time Again\"). That evening, Rita goes to the bed and breakfast Phil is staying in to see what happens when his day starts over, but falls asleep in his room before she can find out (\"Everything About You (Reprise)\").\n\nThe next morning, Phil wakes on 2 February, alone again and decides to engage with the townspeople and better himself, even learning to play the piano (\"Philosopher\"). Phil learns that Ned's wife has died, and later that evening, he finds a homeless man dead in the park, which he spends several days trying to prevent before accepting that some things are inevitable (\"Night Will Come\"). On a new Groundhog Day, Phil delivers a surprisingly profound broadcast before running about town all day helping townspeople (\"Philanthropy\"). Rita arrives at the banquet and overhears everyone in town raving about what Phil has done for them that day, only to discover he is also playing in the band (\"Punxsutawney Rock\"). In a bachelor auction, Rita buys a dance with Phil and kisses him, both feeling that they are only just learning what the other is like (\"Seeing You\"). The next morning, Phil wakes to find Rita still in his room and a fresh layer of snow covering the ground outside. Though overjoyed at finally being able to leave, Phil agrees to spend the day with Rita. They start their day with watching the sun rise in Punxsutawney on 3 February (\"Dawn\").",

Jacobowsky buys the car but as he cannot drive and has overheard the Colonel's plans, proposes that he and the Colonel travel together. The Colonel will have no part of it, but Jacobowsky finally persuades him to do it for Poland (\"For Poland\"), and their Grand Tour begins.\n\nIn St. Cyrille the two meet Marianne, a lovely young French woman to whom the Colonel has promised to return. Mme Vauclain tries to persuade Marianne to leave St. Cyrille before the Germans come, but she will do nothing of the kind (\"I Belong Here\"). Late that night the car bearing Jacobowsky, the Colonel, and Szabuniewicz arrives outside Marianne's house, gives a final gasp, and expires. The Colonel wakens Marianne with music (\"Marianne\"), and although she is reluctant to leave St. Cyrille, Jacobowsky persuades Marianne that the best way to fight for her home is by leaving and remaining free. As she sews the Colonel's papers into her hat for safekeeping, they hurry to catch a local train heading west (\"We're Almost There\").\n\nThe train is halted by a bombed-out rail section and the group moves on to its next mode of transport, the caravan of the traveling Carnival Manzoni. Jacobowsky and Marianne talk, and we see that he is slowly falling in love with her. When the Carnival stops, Jacobowsky sets up a picnic at the side of the road and entertains Marianne while the Colonel glowers jealously in the background (\"More and More / Less and Less\"). The furious Colonel challenges Jacobowsky to a duel, and they are only stopped from shooting each other by the sudden arrival of an SS Captain. To save themselves, the four masquerade as performers in the Carnival: The Colonel and Szabuniewicz as two clowns , Jacobowsky as the human cannonball, and Marianne as his assistant (\"One Extraordinary Thing\"). Jacobowsky is about to climb into the cannon when the Colonel inadvertently gives the game away and they are forced to fire the cannon and make their escape under cover of its smoke and confusion.\n\nThey meet several hours later. Jacobowsky has arranged for a truck hauling nets to take them to the coast, but he will not go. It is time for him to head south to Spain and safety. But in his rush the Colonel has left the papers behind. Moments too late, Jacobowsky finds the papers and inspired by duty and the thought of seeing Marianne once more, he starts off to find her and the Colonel in St. Nazaire.\n\nJacobowsky, on his way to St. Nazaire aboard a small barge, reflects on the one person who has never been a part of his life (\"Mrs. S. L. Jacobowsky\"). When he arrives at Papa Clairon's caf\u00e9, his friends have not yet shown up. But a wedding is about to take place, and he momentarily mistakes the boutonniered bride 's father for the underground contact with the flower in his lapel. The guests are overjoyed to learn that Jacobowsky's father taught biblical history and that he can perform the wedding (\"Wedding Conversation / Mazeltov\"). As the ceremony is concluded, the guests barely have time to scramble to safety as the Nazis enter. A man who remains behind is revealed to the Nazis as a Gestapo agent, but in fact, he is the Colonel's contact. Realizing that the caf\u00e9 is no longer safe, he sends a waitress to intercept the Colonel and tell him the meeting place has been changed to 23 Rue Mace, to the relief of Jacobowsky.\n\nEn route to the caf\u00e9 and now very much aware of the missing papers, Marianne, the Colonel, and Szabuniewicz agonize over their loss. The Colonel realizes how much like Jacobowsky he is \u2014 running, hunted, and in fear of his life (\"I Think, I Think\"). Arriving on a bicycle the waitress tells them of the new meeting place.\n\nAt 23 Rue Mace, the convent of the Sisters of Charity, the Germans have come to billet their troops in spite of Mother Madeleine's outrage. The foursome arrive for their meeting and over-power the Germans. The Colonel is forced to kill the SS Captain, and Jacobowsky throws the other soldiers into the coal cellar and gives the Colonel the secret papers. By now the last barriers are down between the two men, and we see that Jacobowsky and the Colonel are friends at last (\"You I Like\").\n\nLater that night on the wharf outside St. Nazaire they wait for the boat that will take them to England, but there will be room only for two of the four. Szabuniewicz will not go but will return to Poland and fight the Nazis there. Jacobowsky, though he knows that there is no place for him in France, insists that Marianne leave with the Colonel. Jacobowsky's flight will continue, but this time with a difference; if he has found a place in the heart of a Marianne, then what can stop him from finding his place in the world? His Grand Tour is just beginning (\"I'll Be Here Tomorrow (Reprise)\").",

Lawrence, Faye Greenberg and Jamie Houston, and a book by David Simpatico.  It quickly became a popular choice for high school musical theater productions.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nAt East High School (in Albuquerque, New Mexico) (\"Wildcat Cheer\"), Troy Bolton tells his Jock friends, Chad Danforth and Zeke Baylor, about meeting Gabriella Montez on New Year's Eve during winter vacation on a ski trip. Gabriella, who has just moved to Albuquerque, also tells her newfound Brainiac friends Taylor McKessie, Kelsi Nielsen and Martha Cox  of her vacation. We meet Sharpay and Ryan Evans, the two drama stars of the school. Sharpay is selfish, and Ryan follows her orders but tries to be friends with everyone. Troy and Gabriella have a flashback to New Year's Eve when they met. (\"Start of Something New\"). One-half of the song is during the flashback, then we return to East High where Chad, Taylor, Kelsi, Ryan, Sharpay, Zeke and other students sing of their New Year's Resolutions.\n\nIn homeroom, Mrs. Darbus tells her class of the upcoming winter musical, \"Juliet and Romeo\", a new version of Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", written by Kelsi Nielsen, a shy East High student. When Ryan, Sharpay, Troy, and Gabriella start using their cell phones, Mrs. Darbus gives them all detention. Chad interferes, telling Mrs. Darbus that Troy cannot go because they have basketball practice after school and that they have an upcoming championship game. Mrs. Darbus then gives Chad a 30-minute detention, and gives Taylor a 35-minute detention when she remarks that Chad can not even count that high. At Gabriella's locker, Troy runs into her and they show their amazement of how they found each other again. Sharpay walks by and tries to flirt with Troy, but he shows no interest in her. Sharpay observes that he is interested in Gabriella and she is interested in him. Later, the Jocks have basketball practice (\"Get'cha Head in the Game\").\n\nIn a Science class, Gabriella shows her smarts by pointing out a flaw in the teacher's equation. Taylor is impressed and asks, on behalf of her Science Club, if Gabriella could join their team to win the upcoming Scholastic Decathlon, although Gabriella refuses. Sharpay overhears and has Ryan investigate by Googling her.\n\nDiscovering that Gabriella was a very intelligent Brainiac at her old school, Sharpay prints her newfound information and puts it in Taylor's locker. The students later head to Mrs. Darbus's room for detention, and act like animals. Taylor then asks Gabriella again to join the Scholastic Decathlon team based on the printouts Sharpay planted in her locker, and Gabriella agrees. Everyone does the \"ball of noise\", and  Coach Bolton comes to get Troy and Chad for practice and then talks to Mrs. Darbus about it.\n\nThe next day, thespians audition for the play (\"Auditions\"). Sharpay and Ryan audition as well (\"What I've Been Looking For\"). After the auditions have been declared closed, Gabriella and Troy sing the song as Kelsi intended it - much slower (\"What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)\"). Although Troy and Gabriella did not intend it to be an audition they are called back for a second audition. When their friends hear the news they spread it via cell phones (\"Cellular Fusion\").\n\nSharpay is furious, believing Troy and Gabriella have stolen the lead roles and broken the \"rules\" of East High. Though most of the school agrees, lyrical chaos erupts during a lunch break when students begin telling their secret obsessions outside of their cliques (\"Stick to the Status Quo\"). The scene culminates with Sharpay getting \"caked\" by Zeke (who secretly likes her), after Gabriella spins into him. Act I ends with Sharpay angrily shouting \"Someone is going to pay for this!\"\n\n### Act II\n\nJack Scott recaps events before Troy and Gabriella dance on the rooftop garden (\"I Can't Take My Eyes Off of You\"). Zeke comes to Sharpay's locker and tries to flirt with her. Meanwhile, the Jocks and Brainiacs plot against the infuriated duo during study hall. Sharpay and Ryan see the Jocks and the Brainiacs mingling together and imagine they are trying to help Troy and Gabriella. So Sharpay lies to Mrs. Darbus saying that Troy and his dad are trying to ruin the auditions because she gave Troy detention. Later at practice, (\"Wildcat Cheer (Reprise)\"), Mrs. Darbus talks to Troy's dad and then he talks to Troy. Gabriella comes to practice to see Troy while Martha comes and takes her to the lab. Troy's dad thinks Gabriella is the reason why Troy got detention. He tells Troy that he is a playmaker and not a singer. This infuriates Troy who angrily asks his father if he ever wondered if he could be both and storms off in a rage, leaving his father stunned.\n\nThe Jocks and Brainiacs put their plan to work, pushing at Troy and Gabriella to \"split up\". Eventually, Troy, furious with his friends for telling him the same things his dad did, gives in and pretends that he doesn't like Gabriella, completely oblivious to the phone in Zeke's hand, transmitting Troy's words directly to Gabriella (\"Counting on You\"). Gabriella hears and becomes very upset. Troy and Gabriella, lonely and upset, sing (\"When There Was Me and You\"). The Jocks and Brainiacs then realize that they have gone too far and feel guilty for ruining Troy and Gabriella's relationship.\n\nThe next day, Sharpay and Ryan are rehearsing for their callback while Sharpay talks to Ryan about her role in the school. Then Troy comes in looking for Gabriella and Ryan tells him that she is in the theatre. Troy goes to the theatre and tells Gabriella that they were set up and he didn't mean what he said and sings to remind her of New Year's (\"Start of Something New (Reprise)\").\n\nHearing that the callback date has been moved up by request of Sharpay to the same time as the big game and the Scholastic Decathlon, Troy and Gabriella announce to the Jocks and Brainiacs that they are not going to do the callback, but instead help their respective teams for their events. The Jocks and Brainiacs say they should do the callbacks. Troy and Gabriella refuse, but the teams decide to lend a helping hand anyway (\"We're All In This Together\").\n\nOn the day of the big game/Decathlon/callbacks, the students are excited for the festivities. Sharpay and Ryan perform their callback song (\"Bop to the Top\"), which at the same time happens with the basketball championship and the science decathlon, during which Taylor engineers an electronic meltdown in the decathlon and light malfunctions in the game, which forces all the students to move to the theater. Chad and Taylor explain to Troy and Gabriella that this is their only chance. Mrs. Darbus, hesitant to allow Troy and Gabriella an audition due to their lateness, has no choice but to let them audition as the auditorium fills with students (\"Breaking Free\").  Mrs. Darbus gives Troy and Gabriella the parts on the spot with everyone watching.\n\nThe end of Act II brings us to the gym where all the main characters wrap up their plots (Chad asks Taylor to an after-party, Zeke gets Sharpay to be nice to him, Jack Scott and Kelsi flirt, and Sharpay makes up with Gabriella and Troy). The Wildcats win the big game and the Decathlon. The students celebrate (\"We're All in This Together (Reprise)\") followed by a recap of all the major songs in the show (\"Megamix\") during the curtain call.",

        "synopsis": "Best-selling author Thomas Weaver has come back to his hometown to deliver the eulogy for his childhood friend, Alvin Kelby, but finds himself desperately scrambling for something to say. (Write What You Know). His reality is shattered by the memory of Alvin who takes him deep into Thomas's mind cluttered with a lifetime of stories. Alvin suggests that they excavate the story of their first meeting (Mrs. Remington). Thomas rejects Alvin's help but Alvin persists, offering the story of the last time they saw each other, one week ago, when Thomas was tasked with delivering the eulogy for Alvin\u2019s father. Thomas immediately ends this story. Alvin chooses another recalling an evening spent searching his dad's bookstore for a gift for Thomas (The Greatest Gift). Thomas recognizes that the gift, a copy of Tom Sawyer, planted the seed for his desire to become a writer (1876).\n\nAlvin continues selecting stories including a recollection of the time they promised to deliver each other\u2019s eulogy, a promise that locked Thomas into his current dilemma. Alvin chooses a story of Thomas belittling Alvin\u2019s fascination with a flapping butterfly (Normal). Thomas responds by selecting a story telling of the consequences of this behavior. Alvin\u2019s response (People Carry On) gives Thomas a new understanding of his friend. Alvin reintroduces the story of their last time together. Even though Thomas had been asked to write Alvin's father's eulogy, he only offered \u201ca quote from a dead poet.\u201d Again, Thomas shuts this story down.\n\nAlvin persists, choosing stories that track the passing years as life infringed on their friendship. There\u2019s the one of Thomas asking for Alvin\u2019s life-altering critique of a story written for his college application (The Butterfly). There\u2019s the one about their awkward goodbye as Thomas left for school (Saying Goodbye Pt. 1). There\u2019s the one about Thomas coming back with a seemingly insurmountable writing assignment (Here's Where It Begins). There\u2019s the one about Alvin's first meeting with Thomas's fianc\u00e9e (Saying Goodbye Pt, 2). With each story, small connections between them become apparent revealing the effect that Alvin had on Thomas's life.\n\nAlvin selects a story about Thomas inviting Alvin to leave his hometown for the first time, an invitation that irreparably altered their friendship (Independence Day). Thomas tries to excuse his behavior (I Like It Here), but Alvin criticizes the questionable choices made by Thomas throughout their friendship (You're Amazing Tom). Thomas attempts to explain the struggles of creativity using a failed \"work in progress\" as an example but Alvin's rebuttal pushes him to the edge of a nervous breakdown (Nothing There) desperately searching for anything to put this eulogy behind him.\n\nAlvin reintroduces the story of their last meeting and Thomas lets it play out. Thomas's failed attempt to write Alvin's father's eulogy leads to a final rift in the friendship and Alvin chooses to deliver his father's eulogy off the cuff. Thomas watches as Alvin's eloquent words let him see his friend as he's never seen him before (I Didn't See Alvin).\n\nThomas begs Alvin to reveal the story of his death but Alvin tells him that this is one story that Thomas will never know (This Is It). Thomas revisits his work in progress (Angels In the Snow) and is finally able to finish. Alvin's presence fades.

Set in farm country outside the town of Claremore , Indian Territory , in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry.  A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fianc\u00e9e, Ado Annie.\n\nThe original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943. It was a box office hit and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an Oscar -winning 1955 film adaptation .  It has long been a popular choice for school and community productions. Rodgers and Hammerstein won a special Pulitzer Prize for Oklahoma! in 1944.\n\nThis musical, building on the innovations of the earlier Show Boat , epitomized the development of the \" book musical \", a musical play in which the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story, with serious dramatic goals, that is able to evoke genuine emotions other than amusement. In addition, Oklahoma! features musical themes, or motifs , that recur throughout the work to connect the music and story. [ page\u00a0needed ] A fifteen-minute \" dream ballet \" reflects Laurey's struggle with her feelings about two men, Curly and Jud.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn Oklahoma Territory, in 1906, cowboy Curly McLain looks forward to a beautiful day as he visits farm girl Laurey Williams's yard (\" Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin' \"). He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a box social dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. Each man who wins a basket will eat lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long. To persuade her, he says he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (\" The Surrey with the Fringe on Top \"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a surrey .\n\nThe lonely, disturbed farmhand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance. She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud. Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns from a trip to modern Kansas City , and shows off his souvenirs (\"Kansas City\"). He won $50 ($1,700 today) at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie's father, Andrew Carnes, is the amount he needs to marry Ado Annie. Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her and one for her father: a Little Wonder (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside). He is unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will was away, she has spent a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a Persian peddler. Laurey says she'll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (\" I Cain't Say No \").  Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly. Laurey notices and tells her friends that she doesn't really care about Curly (\" Many a New Day \").\n\nAndrew Carnes sees Annie with Ali Hakim; he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her. Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (\" It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage! \"). Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead. Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey protests that she does not love Curly (\" People Will Say We're in Love \"). Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him. Curly jokingly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (\"Pore Jud Is Daid\"). Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (\" Lonely Room \").\n\nConfused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a \"magic potion\" ( laudanum ) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love. She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (\"Out of My Dreams\"). Soon asleep under the influence of the opiate, in an extended ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of marriage with Curly. Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly; she cannot escape him, confused by her desires (\" Dream Ballet \"). Awakening, she realizes that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud, who arrives, and they leave for the box social.\n\n### Act II\n\nAt the social, during a square dance (\" The Farmer and the Cowman \"), the rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys over fences and water rights leads to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone. Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. To rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would not have the money to pay her father. Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket comes up for auction. Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money. Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket. Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance. Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\" All Er Nuthin' \").\n\nJud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her. When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her. She then fires him as her farmhand, demanding that he get off her property. Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; she bursts into tears and calls for Curly. She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now.  Curly reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\"People Will Say We're In Love\" (reprise)). He realizes that he must now become a farmer. Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye, telling her Will is the man she should marry.\n\nThree weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married as everyone celebrates the territory's impending statehood (\" Oklahoma \"). Ali Hakim returns with Gertie, whom he has recently married after being threatened by her father with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, kisses Laurey and punches Curly, and they begin a fistfight. Jud attacks Curly with a knife, and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife. Jud soon dies. The wedding guests hold a makeshift trial for Curly, at Aunt Eller's urging. The judge, Andrew Carnes, declares the verdict: \"not guilty!\" Curly and Laurey depart on their honeymoon in the surrey with the fringe on top (\"Finale Ultimo\").",

In 1945, the film was remade as a musical with original songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein .  This was subsequently remade in 1962 as well as adapted into a made-for-television movie in 1976 . The stage production closely follows the plot of its predecessors, providing a glimpse into the life of a farming family, the Frakes, and their three-day adventure at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines in 1946. While parents Abel and Melissa are hoping to win a few blue ribbons , siblings Margy and Wayne are more interested in finding romance on the midway.",
        "synopsis": "Act I\n\nIt is a Tuesday afternoon in summer 1946 on the Frake family farm in Brunswick, Iowa, as the family prepares to leave for the Iowa State Fair . The family patriarch, Abel, is hoping that his prized boar, Blue Boy, will win the livestock sweepstakes. Abel's wife, Melissa, has her heart set on ribbons for her mincemeat and sour pickles, while their son, Wayne, is practicing throwing hoops, hoping to win prizes from the midway games (\u201cOpening (Our State Fair)\u201d). Wayne is suddenly saddened when he learns that his girlfriend, Eleanor, was accepted to college, and she cannot go to the fair with him.\n\nLocal shopkeeper Dave Miller is skeptical about the family's hopes. He makes a $5 bet that something is bound to go wrong for Blue Boy or the family. Abel accepts. Meanwhile, the Frakes' daughter, Margy, is feeling down and doesn't understand why (\u201cIt Might as Well Be Spring\u201d). Her boyfriend, Harry, arrives at the farm and presses her for an answer to his marriage proposal; she agrees to give him an answer when she returns home. That night, the family leaves for the fair, awaiting the surprises that lie ahead (\u201cDriving at Night/Our State Fair\u201d).\n\nAfter arriving at the fair on Wednesday morning, Wayne heads straight for the midway, where he is hustled by a carnie at a ring-throwing game. A beautiful mysterious woman defends on Wayne's behalf, and he falls head over heels in love before he even knows her name (\u201cThat\u2019s for Me\u201d). Later that afternoon, Abel and his farmer buddies are at the beer tent and trading stories about their prized pigs (\u201cMore Than Just a Friend\u201d). Meanwhile, Pat Gilbert, a former World War II reporter, arrives with Charlie, a photographer, to cover the fair for the Des Moines Register . He runs into Margy, whom he repeatedly tries to court, and she remains forbidding until he begins to win her over (\u201cIsn't It Kinda Fun?\u201d). That night, Wayne heads to the Starlight Dance Meadow in time to catch a show. The performer is a singer named Emily Arden, who happens to be the woman he met earlier in the day (\u201cYou Never Had it So Good\u201d). She buys him a drink, and tells Wayne that her dream is to become a Broadway star. He charmingly asks her out. She agrees, but only on the bounds that their relationship only lasts for the rest of the fair.\n\nThursday morning arrives and Margy complains to Melissa about Harry (\u201cIt Might as Well Be Spring (Reprise)\u201d). Abel walks in, overjoyed at the promise of victory and winning, and he proposes an evening of fun and dancing with his family (\u201cWhen I Go Out Walking With My Baby\u201d). At the Exhibit Hall that afternoon, the pickles and mincemeat are being judged. Unknowingly, Abel spiked Melissa's with a full bottle of brandy, sending the judges into a drunken fit of giggles and tipsiness. Melissa wins the blue ribbon and a special plaque. Pat and Charlie capture the euphoric moment. From a quiet hillside, Wayne and Emily watch the midway below. He wants to further continue their relationship, telling her that they have so many more memories to make, but she remains unsettled (\u201cSo Far\u201d). At the Starlight Dance Meadow that night, fairgoers gather for a dreamy waltz. Abel and Melissa dance romantically, Wayne and Emily arrive with a distinctive glow, and Pat and Margy share a passionate kiss when, to Margy's shock, Harry arrives at the fair (\u201cA Grand Night for Singing\u201d).\n\nAct II\n\nIt is now Friday, the last day of the fair. Despite Harry's presence, Pat and Margy are growing closer and more in love. While walking the midway alone, Pat runs into Jeanne and Vivian, two dancers whom he formerly shared intimate relationships with. They both try to flirt with him, but they notice that Pat has changed, as he admits that he has finally found real love (\u201cThe Man I Used to Be\u201d). Blue Boy is declared the winner of the livestock sweepstakes, and the livestock tent turns into a celebration led by Abel (\u201cAll I Owe Ioway\u201d). Afterwards, Charlie tells Pat that he has landed a job interview with the Chicago Tribune , but it would mean catching the first train out of Iowa (\u201cThe Man I Used to Be (Reprise)\u201d). Reluctant to leave Margy in the high point, he leaves just as she arrives for their night out (\u201cIsn't it Kinda Fun? (Reprise)\u201d).\n\nThe scene shifts to the Starlight Dance Meadow for the closing performance of the fair, headlined by Emily (\u201cThat\u2019s the Way It Happens\u201d). Wayne proclaims his love for Emily that night, but she breaks it off, revealing that she is married and was abandoned by her husband, making her scared to fall in love again. Back at the campsite, Abel and Melissa are watching the stars together. Melissa is concerned about the children growing up too fast, but Abel assures her that they raised Wayne and Margy well, and that when the children do move out, the couple will always be there for each other (\u201cBoys and Girls Like You and Me\u201d). On the darkened midway, the fair is over, and being dismantled. Margy is waiting for Pat, remembering that he said he wouldn't break it off, he just wouldn't be around (\u201cThe Next Time it Happens\u201d). Harry enters, pleading to Margy for her hand in marriage, though her refusal finally leads him to realize that she simply just doesn't love him.\n\nUpon returning to the family farm on Saturday morning, there is a full spread in the local newspaper detailing their experience at the Fair word-by-word, with extra emphasis on Margy, secretly written by Pat. Dave Miller returns, Abel pleads for him to cough up the money, but Dave reminds Abel that the bet was not about victory, but happiness. He emphasizes to Abel that he won't pay up until he is certain that everyone enjoyed themselves at the fair. Wayne and Eleanor have become engaged. Margy, however, has come in moping, saying that she has outgrown the fair. Shockingly, Pat has arrived at the Frake house, apologizing to Margy about leaving early, he reveals that he has been hired for the job in Chicago and he wants Margy to come with him. He gets down on one knee and proposes, Margy accepts. Dave Miller begrudgingly hands a $5 bill to Abel, and the two men shake hands and walk inside the house together (\"Finale Ultimo\").",

It spawned a successful West End production running for just over two years, national tours in the US and UK, many productions worldwide and a 2005 film version .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn New York in 1959, theatre producer Max Bialystock opens Funny Boy , a musical version of Hamlet . Reviews are overwhelmingly negative, and the show closes after one performance (\"Opening Night\"). Max, who was once called the King of Broadway, tells a crowd of down-and-outs of his past achievements and vows to return to form (\"King of Broadway\").\n\nThe next day, Leo Bloom , a mousy accountant, comes to Max's office to audit his books. When one of Max's elderly female \"investors\" arrives, Max tells Leo to wait in the bathroom until she leaves. She plays a sex game with Max, who persuades her to give him a check to be invested in his next play, to be called \"Cash\". Leo reveals his lifelong dream to be a Broadway producer. After recovering from a panic attack caused by Max touching his blue blanket, Leo tells Max that he has found an accounting error in his books: Max raised $100,000 for Funny Boy , but the play only cost $98,000. Max begs Leo to cook the books to hide the discrepancy; Leo reluctantly agrees. After some calculations, he realizes that, by bilking investors, a producer could profit more from a flop than from a hit. Inspired, Max proposes a scheme to find the worst musical ever written, hire the worst director and actors in New York, raise $2 million of investment from elderly women, produce the work on Broadway, close it after one night, and escape to Rio de Janeiro with the money. However, Leo refuses to help Max with his scheme (\"We Can Do It\").\n\nLeo's antagonistic boss, Mr. Marks, reprimands him for arriving at work six minutes late and calls him a nobody. While he and his miserable co-workers toil over accounts, Leo daydreams of becoming a Broadway producer (\"I Wanna Be a Producer\"). He realizes that his job is terrible, quits, and returns to Max (\"We Can Do It\" (reprise)). The next day, they search for the most offensive play they can find and discover Springtime for Hitler : A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden , an admiring tribute to Adolf Hitler written by ex- Nazi soldier Franz Liebkind . They go to the playwright's home in Greenwich Village to get the rights to the play, where Franz is on the roof of his tenement with his pigeons reminiscing about life back in Germany (\"In Old Bavaria\"). The producers get him to sign their contract by joining him in singing Hitler's favorite tune (\"Der Guten Tag Hop Clop\") and reciting the Siegfried Oath, under penalty of death, promising never to dishonor Hitler's spirit or memory. In doing so, Franz gives Hitler's middle name as \"Elizabeth\", explaining that his ancestors include \"a long line of English queens \".\n\nAt the townhouse of the flamboyant transvestite and failing director Roger De Bris , Roger and his domestic partner Carmen Ghia initially decline the offer to direct because of the serious subject matter. After much persuading and invoking the possibility of a Tony Award, Roger relents and tells the producers that the second act must be rewritten so the Germans win World War II while also insisting that the play be more \" gay \" (\"Keep It Gay\"). Max and Leo return to the office to meet Ulla , a beautiful Swedish woman who wants to audition for their next play (\"When You've Got It, Flaunt It\"). The producers are impressed, mostly by her sex-appeal, and hire her as a clerical worker. Max leaves to raise $2 million to produce Springtime for Hitler by calling on elderly women from all over New York (\"Along Came Bialy\"), and succeeds at raising the money (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n### Act II\n\nLeo and Ulla are left alone in Max's office, which she has \"redecorated\", and they start to fall in love (\"That Face\"). Max walks in and sees the tempting form of Ulla's covered behind (\"That Face\" (reprise)).\n\nAt the auditions for the role of Hitler, Roger rejects one actor after another in summary fashion. Finally, a frustrated Franz performs his own jazzy rendition of \"Haben Sie Geh\u00f6rt Das Deutsche Band?\", at the end of which Max approves Franz's audition. Opening night arrives (\"Opening Night\" (reprise)), and after Leo curses the production by wishing everyone \"good luck\" rather than the traditional \"break a leg\" (\"You Never Say 'Good Luck' on Opening Night\"), Franz literally breaks his leg falling down the stairs. Roger is the only one other than Franz who knows the part of Hitler, and he rushes to the dressing room to get ready. The curtain rises, and Max and Leo watch the opening number (\" Springtime for Hitler \"), which shocks the audience, before sneaking away. Unfortunately, Roger plays Hitler so flamboyantly that the audience mistakes the show for satire, and it becomes a surprise smash.\n\nBack at the office, Max and Leo are horrified that the IRS will learn of their actions as they read positive critical reviews for Springtime (\"Where Did We Go Right?\"). Roger and Carmen come to congratulate them, only to find them fighting over the accounting books. Franz bursts in, waving a pistol, outraged by Roger's portrayal of Hitler. Fearful for his life, Max suggests that Franz shoot the actors instead of the producers as a way to close the show. The police are summoned by the commotion and arrest Franz, who breaks his other leg while trying to escape. They also arrest Max and take the books. As Leo hides, Ulla finds him and persuades him to take the $2 million and run off to Rio with her.\n\nIn jail awaiting trial, Max receives a postcard from Leo, now living in Rio and having eloped with Ulla. Feeling betrayed, he recounts the events of the story (\"Betrayed\"). At his trial, Max is found \"incredibly guilty\", but Leo and Ulla arrive in the nick of time. Leo turns in the stolen money and tells the judge that Max is a good man who has never hurt anyone despite his swindling, and the only man he has ever called a friend (\"'Til Him\"). Touched by their friendship, the judge decides not to separate the partners, sending them and Franz to Sing Sing prison together for five years. In prison, they write a new musical entitled \" Prisoners of Love \", and they are pardoned by the governor of New York for bringing joy into the lives of their inmates by having them act in the play. Soon after taking Prisoners of Love to Broadway, with Roger and Ulla in the main roles, Leo and Max become successful producers and walk off into the sunset (\"Leo & Max\"). Everyone comes back for one last song, telling the audience to leave (\"Goodbye!\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe young woman Charity Hope Valentine is a taxi dancer at a dance hall called the Fandango Ballroom in New York City . With a shoulder bag and a heart tattooed on her left shoulder, Charity meets her boyfriend Charlie in Central Park . While Charlie silently preens himself, Charity speaks the pick-up lines she imagines him saying, and tells him how handsome he is (\"You Should See Yourself\"). Charlie then steals her handbag and pushes her into the lake (usually the orchestra pit ) before running off. Passers-by discuss the apparent drowning but do nothing, until a young Spaniard finally rescues her. In the Hostess Room of the Fandango Ballroom, Charity tries to convince both herself and the other skeptical taxi dancers that Charlie tried to save her. Nickie, a fellow dancer, tells Charity that \u201cyour big problem is you run your heart like a hotel \u2013 you got guys checkin\u2019 in and out all the time\u201d. The manager, Herman, arrives to tell them it is time for work. The hostess dancers proposition the audience in the front room of the Fandango Ballroom (\" Big Spender \"). Helene and Nickie try to comfort Charity about Charlie's absence (\"Charity's Soliloquy\").\n\nOn the street, after work, Charity gives to every beggar who approaches her until she realizes she has no money. Just then, film star Vittorio Vidal rushes out of the smart Pompeii Club, in pursuit of his beautiful mistress, Ursula. Ursula refuses to go back inside with Vittorio, who promptly takes the only-too-willing Charity instead. Inside the Pompeii Club, the dancers are dancing the latest craze, The Rich Man's Frug . To everyone's astonishment, the famous Vittorio is accompanied by the unknown Charity. She tries to steer him away from the subject of Ursula. Finally, he wants to dance. Not having eaten since breakfast, Charity faints. There is general agreement amongst the dancers that she needs to be \"laid down\". Vittorio asks \"where?\", and Charity recovers enough to prompt Vittorio with \"your apartment!\".\n\nLying down on Vittorio's bed, Charity claims she is no longer hungry. She admits she is a dance hall hostess, putting it down to \"the fickle finger of fate\" (a favorite expression of hers). Vittorio is struck by her humor and honesty. Starstruck, Charity asks for a signed photograph to prove to the girls she was really in his apartment. While Vittorio fetches props from his old movies for further evidence, Charity remarks on her good fortune (\" If My Friends Could See Me Now \"). Ursula arrives to apologize for her jealousy; Charity is swiftly bundled into a closet before Vittorio opens the door to Ursula. (\"Too Many Tomorrows\")  While Charity watches from the closet, Vittorio and Ursula make love inside his four-poster bed.  The following morning, Charity is escorted from the room by a mortified Vittorio. In the Hostess Room, the girls are disappointed that Charity failed to get more out of Vittorio. Nickie announces she is not going to remain at this job for the rest of her life, prompting the girls to speculate on alternative careers (\"There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This\"), but Herman brings them back down to earth. Charity decides to seek some cultural enlightenment at the 92nd Street Y , where she gets stuck in a broken elevator with shy tax accountant Oscar Lindquist. While trying to calm him down, Charity learns that he is not married. She declares, \"Oh Oscar... You're gonna be all right.\" After helping Oscar overcome his claustrophobia (\"I'm the Bravest Individual\"), the pair are plunged into new panic when the lights stop working.\n\n### Act II\n\nAfter being trapped in a broken elevator, Oscar and Charity are finally rescued when it starts working again. Oscar invites Charity to go to church with him, to which she hesitantly agrees. As they walk under the Manhattan Bridge to the church, the faint cries of the next person to be stuck in the elevator are heard. The Rhythm of Life Church turns out to be a thin veneer on hippie culture (\" The Rhythm of Life \"). A police raid breaks up the meeting. Traveling home on the subway, Oscar proposes another date and tries to guess Charity's job, deciding that she works in a bank. Charity lies, saying she works for First National City , Williamsburg Branch. As they part, Oscar kisses her hand, and dubs her Sweet Charity (\"Sweet Charity\").\n\nAfter two weeks, Oscar and Charity have continued dating, and she still has not confessed what she actually does for a living. At Coney Island Amusement Park they become trapped again when the Parachute Jump ride breaks. This time, Oscar is the calm one while Charity is scared \u2014 scared that she is starting to depend on him. Once again, Charity loses her nerve about telling him what her real job is. As the crowd looks on, the couple kisses. On a slow night at the Fandango, Charity loses the opportunity to snare one of the few customers to a new co-worker, Rosie. Disgusted by the whole business, she quits. However, in Times Square , she wonders what the alternative is (\"Where Am I Going?\"). Sending a telegram to Oscar, she asks to meet him at Barney's Chile Hacienda. She admits that she is a dance hall hostess; he admits he already knows, having followed her one night and watched her dancing. He says he does not care and wants to marry her. Relieved and elated, Charity leaves (\"I'm A Brass Band\") and packs a suitcase on which is printed 'Almost Married'.\n\nAfter a farewell party at the Ballroom (\"I Love to Cry at Weddings\"), Charity and Oscar walk in the park, whereupon Oscar announces that he cannot go through with the wedding, saying he is unable to stop thinking about the \"other men\". Eventually,  believing he\u2019s sparing her an unhappy life with him, he pushes her into the lake and runs off. Emerging from the lake, Charity, speaking directly to the audience, asks \"Did you ever have one of those days?\". Realizing that unlike Charlie, Oscar has not stolen her bag, she shrugs and reprises her opening dance.\n\nThe stage blacks out onto three neon signs , reading \"And so she lived \u2026 hopefully \u2026 ever after\".",

After a visit to Oaken, Olaf, Sven, and their sleigh full of traditions travel through the snowy tundra only for a piece of coal (from a portable sauna that Oaken had given them) to set the sleigh on fire.

Pepa, a working actress and singer, arrives at a film recording studio, where she is scheduled to dub a duet with Ivan. Still reeling from his message and hoping to get some answers, she is disappointed to learn he has already laid down his vocal tracks and gone. As she sings to his recorded voice, we hear her thoughts, the conversation she would have with Ivan if only he were there (\"Lie To Me\"), and she faints from the emotion of the song. A doctor is called, and Pepa admits she has been experiencing some morning sickness for the past few weeks. The doctor insists on running some tests just to be sure. Pepa protests. There's only one thing that's wrong with her, and it's an ailment that seems to be affecting every woman in town (\"Lovesick\"). Pepa sets off to find Ivan at his apartment and learns that he hasn't slept there in weeks. She leaves a card to let him know she was there, but it is quickly snatched away by a mysterious woman. Aided by the Mambo Taxi Driver, Pepa pursues her through the streets.\n\nThe woman is Lucia Beltran, Ivan's ex-wife, who is suing him for his desertion of her twenty years before and her resulting time in a mental facility. Back in her apartment, Lucia goes through a trunk full of memories - letters, clothes, and an old record (\"Time Stood Still\") which take her back to a happier time full of hope. Lucia is brought back to the present by the appearance by her shy, stammering son Carlos, and his unhappy, frustrated fianc\u00e9e Marisa. They inform Lucia they will begin looking for apartments tomorrow in anticipation of their upcoming wedding. Furious at being abandoned once again, Lucia throws Carlos' suitcases out into the night. As Carlos and Marisa gather their things from the street below, they question their relationship and their future together (\"My Crazy Heart\"). The next morning, Pepa returns home to an answering machine full of messages from her best friend, the fashion model and eternal romantic Candela, who has finally found the perfect man, except for one small hitch: he just may be an international terrorist (\"Model Behavior\"). Pepa wanders her penthouse apartment and remembers the life she shared there with Ivan (\"Island\"). Meanwhile, back in his old studio, Ivan is packing to leave town, when he receives a visit from Carlos. Torn between his mother and his fianc\u00e9e, the young man receives a lesson from his golden-voiced father about how to communicate with women (\"The Microphone\").\n\nPepa is about to reach the end of her rope. She prepares a batch of gazpacho laced with sedatives in anticipation of Ivan's return. She is interrupted by the arrival of Candela, seeking refuge from both the terrorists and the police, and by Carlos and Marisa, who through a series of mix-ups have found Pepa's address on their list of apartments for rent. As their disparate lives and stories begin to come together, the women are all starting to come apart. Pepa learns that Ivan is leaving town with another woman. Marisa realizes her future with Carlos is about to slip away. Candela, trapped, terrified (and, unable to get Pepa's attention in any other way) jumps off the penthouse terrace. Just as it seems things can't get any more complicated, the doctor announces Pepa's test results: she's pregnant (\"On The Verge\").\n\nAct II\n\nSometime during the intermission, Candela has changed her mind; she can't go through with it. Pepa and Carlos pull her back to safety. Shaken and upset, Candela tells them of her tormented infatuation with the wild and romantic Malik. (As soon as she saw the grenade belt, she \"knew something was up\".) Now the police are searching for him and she is afraid she'll be arrested for harboring the fugitive. Carlos suggests they talk to his mother's attorney, Paulina Morales. Noticing Carlos' attraction to the beautiful and fragile Candela, Marisa retreats to the kitchen, where she unknowingly drinks the sedative-laced gazpacho and passes out, as Pepa heads off to get the attorney's help. Outside her building, Pepa has a moment alone, as she considers the news of her pregnancy through memories of her own mother (\"Mother's Day\"). She is joined by her pious Concierge, who senses Pepa's troubles and tries to reassure her that things have a way of working out \u2013 \u2018Sometimes you think you're praying for one thing, but God knows better.\u2019 As she heads toward the lawyer's office, Pepa is unaware the woman Ivan is involved with is the same woman she is about to meet - Paulina. Although she tries to resist Ivan's pleas to go away with him, he eventually seduces her with his philosophy of eternal love (\"Yesterday, Tomorrow, And Today\"). Pepa arrives to see Paulina and is confused by the attorney's hostile reception and refusal to help Candela. Meanwhile, back at the apartment, Carlos and Candela find themselves growing closer.\n\nThey discover a note outlining Malik's plans for an attack on the main courthouse and anonymously call the police to warn them, as the various characters all try to sort out the mess of their intertwining lives (\"Tangled\"). At the courthouse, Lucia is heard presenting her petition against Ivan to the Magistrates. She demands that her story must be heard (\"Invisible\"). As she becomes more unraveled, her case is dismissed, and she realizes she has been left with only one solution - she must find a way to make Ivan disappear for good. Pepa returns home and informs Candela that their only safe recourse is to leave town for a while. Besides, there is nothing more for her here (\"Island\" (reprise)). Just as she and Candela are about to go, the police arrive, having traced the anonymous phone tip to Pepa's number. Lucia arrives as well in search of Ivan and demanding to know where he is. Pepa puts the pieces together and realizes he is at the courthouse, about to run off with Paulina. She tries to go after them, but is stopped by the two officers. Pepa concedes and graciously offers them each a glass of the sedative-laced gazpacho. They pass out, and before Pepa can stop her, Lucia grabs the police officers' guns and heads off to the courthouse to kill Ivan. A chase ensues, with Pepa arriving just in time to warn Ivan and save him from Lucia's gunshot. (The bullet providentially wounded Malik, turning Lucia into a national heroine.)\n\nIvan thanks Pepa and realizes how much he really cares for her. All he wants is for the two of them to go home and pretend this day never happened (\"Lie To Me\" (reprise)). Pepa does want that, but recalls her Concierge's words from earlier. She kisses Ivan goodbye and exits. Pepa returns home and is greeted by her Concierge, who tells Pepa she has been praying for her all day. Pepa smiles; she thinks it may have worked. She heads upstairs to begin her new life, as the women gather together and joyfully look toward the future (\"Shoes From Heaven\").",

The music was mostly adapted from several pieces composed by Alexander Borodin . The story concerns a wily poet who talks his way out of trouble several times; meanwhile, his beautiful daughter meets and falls in love with the young caliph .\n\nThe musical was first produced on Broadway in 1953 and won the Tony Award for best musical in 1954. It was also successful in London's West End and has been given several revivals.  A 1955 film version was produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer .",
        "synopsis": "Kismet is set in a fictional Baghdad in the times of The Arabian Nights .\n\n### Act 1\n\nAt a mosque , an imam prays as the sun rises (\"The Sands of Time\"). Three beggars sit outside the temple, but the fourth, Hajj , has gone to Mecca .  Crying \"Rhymes! Fine Rhymes!\", a poet enters to sell his verses. His beautiful daughter Marsinah joins in the sales pitch, but they have no success (\"Rhymes Have I\"). Marsinah is sent to steal oranges in the Bazaar for their breakfast, while her father sits down to beg. When the beggars object to the poet's taking Hajj's place, he claims to be a cousin of Hajj.  The poet threatens to curse those who do not give him money and soon earns a few coins (\"Fate\").  Hassen-Ben, a huge man from the desert, mistakes him for Hajj and kidnaps him.  The poet (who is referred to as Hajj thereafter) is taken to Jawan, a notorious brigand .  Fifteen years ago, the real Hajj had placed a curse on Jawan that resulted in the disappearance of the brigand's little son. Now he wants the curse removed. The new Hajj, seeing an opportunity to make some money, promises to do so for 100 gold pieces. Jawan leaves for Baghdad to search for his son, and Hajj rejoices in his new-found riches (\"Fate\" (reprise)).\n\nBack in the city, the wazir of police comes through the busy bazaar (\"Bazaar of the Caravans\"). The evil wazir and his seductive, beautiful wife-of-wives, Lalume, discuss a loan he desperately needs. In return for the money lent from the king of Ababu, the wazir must arrange for the caliph to marry one (or all three) of the princesses of Ababu, who perform a sexy dance. Through their amah , the princesses tell Lalume that they wish to return home. Lalume convinces them that Baghdad is much more exciting than any other place on earth (\"Not Since Nineveh\").\n\nMarsinah is being pursued by a fruit merchant whose wares she has stolen.  Her father arrives to rescue her, giving the man money.  Hajj gives his daughter half of the money and leaves. The merchants set out their finest \"Baubles, Bangles and Beads\" for the young lady.  The young caliph and his advisor, Omar Khayyam , have been traveling incognito. He is struck by Marsinah's beauty and follows her.  Elsewhere, Hajj is basking in the glow of some scantily-dressed slave girls he has just bought, when he is stopped by the police, who are checking identities because they are looking for Jawan. The Chief recognizes, on the coins, the crest of a family Jawan has robbed and arrests Hajj as a thief.  Meanwhile, Marsinah has found a quaint little house with a beautiful garden to buy for her father and herself. She is admiring the garden when the Caliph slips in and, pretending to be a gardener, introduces himself to her. They fall in love on the spot (\"Stranger in Paradise\").  They promise to meet again in the garden at moonrise.  The Caliph tells Omar that he has fallen in love, which is overheard by the princesses of Ababu; they are furious that he seems to ignore them, but the Chief Policeman reassures them that \"He's in Love\".\n\nAt the wazir's palace, Hajj is on trial for the theft of 100 pieces of gold. The wazir has no need for evidence; he sentences Hajj to 20 lashes, and his right hand is to be cut off.  The poet pleads that, as a poet and storyteller, the loss of a hand would cripple his career; it is the gesture that tells the story (\"Gesticulate\").  The lovely Lalume, attracted to the handsome poet, begs her husband for forgiveness, but the Wazir is not convinced and orders his guards to drag Hajj off to punishment.  As Hajj curses the wazir, a guard bursts in with news that they have captured Jawan.  The old brigand is brought in and asks Hajj where his son is.  He sees, around the wazir's neck, a medallion that his son was wearing when he was captured. The wazir is his son! Jawan praises the power of the great magician, Hajj, a man who has the power to curse and uncurse.  Jawan is thrilled to see his son, but the Wazir sentences his own father to death. \"For the leading judge of Mesopotamia to have as a father the leading criminal of Mesopotamia,\" he says, is \"a disturbing thought.\"\n\nAs Jawan is led to his execution, the wazir realizes that the \"powerful magician\" has cursed him. Just when he is about to murder Hajj, the caliph enters with news that he has found a bride, a commoner, and that he will marry her tonight.  The wazir is distraught: if the caliph does not marry a princess of Ababu, the wazir will be ruined.  He concludes that this is a result of Hajj's curse and begs Hajj to reverse the situation, promising him a reprieve and the title of Emir . Hajj agrees. Lalume knows that the poet is no wizard, but she decides that he may be her chance out of a dull life (\"Bored\") and is falling in love with him; she promises to help.  When the wazir returns, Hajj sings a mystic-sounding invocation to fate as the slave-girls dance wildly, distracting the wazir. Hajj jumps out of a window, leaving his coat behind him. When the wazir sees he is gone, he clutches the cloak in amazement and faints.\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe caliph and his wedding procession approach the house of his beloved (\"Night of my Nights\"). Inside, Marsinah thinks only of her gardener (\"Stranger in Paradise\" (reprise)). Hajj enters and tells her of his situation and says that they must flee immediately to Damascus , but Marsinah refuses to go. They argue, and he nearly strikes her before he runs off, ashamed.  She departs in the opposite direction. When the caliph enters the garden, his love is not there.\n\nThe wazir is informed by his spies that the caliph's bride has disappeared.  He rejoices at the power he wields, by having a magician as Emir (\"Was I Wazir?\"). He instructs Lalume to keep his new Emir happy, and she is eager to comply (\"Rahadlakum\").  Hajj and Lalume are discussing a trip to a \"small oasis, a week's travel by camel\" when Marsinah enters the Harem.  Father and daughter reconcile, and she tells him of her lover and asks him to find him.  At the same time, the caliph, in the next room, orders the wazir to find his love (\"And This Is My Beloved\").   Hajj and Omar encounter each other and engage in a battle of wits (\"The Olive Tree\").\n\nThe wazir, hoping to convince the caliph that only wanting one wife is just a phase, shows him his harem through a peephole where he sees Marsinah. The caliph is horrified that his love is a member of the wazir's Harem, and the wazir, sure that Hajj has arranged the whole thing, claims that she is one of his wives. The caliph, heartbroken, agrees to choose his wife-of-wives that night during his diwan .  So as not to have lied to his prince, the wazir immediately marries Marsinah, promising to visit her that night. She vows to kill herself if he does.\n\nThat night, at the caliph's diwan, the candidates for his hand dance for him: Princess Zubbediya of Damascus, Princess Samaris of Bangalore, and the three Ababu princesses. The caliph is unmoved.  Hajj is searching for Marsinah; the wazir thanks the \"wizard\" for placing the caliph's beloved in his own harem. Laughing, he tells him that he has married the pretty little Marsinah.  Realizing what has happened, Hajj pulls a knife, but has a better idea. He takes a blank plaque and throws it in a pool, proclaiming that when it is retrieved, it will read the name of the caliph's fated bride. He secretly gives the wazir another tablet, this one with the name Ababu written on it, and tells him to substitute it for the tablet from the pool.  When the wazir enters the pool, Hajj trips him and holds him underwater until he drowns.\n\nHajj explains all to the caliph, who is joyfully reunited with Marsinah. The caliph is ready to pardon Hajj for his murder of a public official, but the poet requests, as his punishment, to be \"banished to some dreadful oasis ... at least a week's journey away by camel,\" and to be made to comfort the wazir's widow in her \"grief\". As the two couples unite, the poet reflects on the fleetingness of \"The Sands of Time\".",

        "description": "The Lightning Thief is a musical with music and lyrics by Rob Rokicki and a book by Joe Tracz, based on the 2005 novel of the same name by Rick Riordan . In the musical, Percy Jackson - a teenage boy who discovers that he is a demigod - goes on a quest to find Zeus 's missing lightning bolt to prevent a war between the Greek gods .",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nPercy Jackson, a teenage boy with ADHD and dyslexia , is on a field trip to the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art . While there, his substitute pre-algebra teacher, Mrs. Dodds, asks to speak with him. Once alone, Mrs. Dodds transforms into a Fury , a mythological Greek demon of Hades . Thanks to a pen that transforms into a sword named Riptide, thrown to Percy by his Latin teacher, Mr. Brunner, Percy manages to fend off and vaporize Mrs. Dodds. After this incident Percy is expelled from his school on the grounds that he failed to stay with the group while being on probation. When Percy tries to explain what happened, he is shocked to find that neither Mr. Brunner, his best friend Grover Underwood, nor anyone else remembers Mrs. Dodds (\"Prologue/The Day I Got Expelled\"). Percy says goodbye to them and heads home for summer vacation.\n\nBack at his apartment, his mother, Sally Jackson, seems to understand and even forgive Percy's expulsion, while her husband, Gabe Ugliano, does not. \u201cSmelly\u201d Gabe abuses Percy, and Sally confesses she needs to tell him about his father, who left before Percy was born. Percy, extremely bitter about his father and upset with himself for being expelled yet again, regrets his actions and becomes increasingly hard on himself. Sally assures Percy the quirks and abnormalities of someone are what make them special (\"Strong\"). Sally takes Percy to the beach where she met Percy's father, and the two run into Grover. Percy is shocked when he learns that Grover is a satyr .\n\nSuddenly, a Minotaur (half-bull, half-man) attacks the trio. Sally sacrifices herself so that Percy and Grover can make it to a place she calls \"camp\". Percy kills the minotaur to avenge his mother but is kicked in the head and falls unconscious. He dreams of a man in a Hawaiian shirt, who gives him a seashell, claiming, \"What belongs to the sea can always return to the sea\" (\"The Minotaur/The Weirdest Dream\").\n\nWhen Percy awakens, he finds himself in a place called Camp Half-Blood. The shell the strange man in his dream gifted him remains in his pocket. The camp director, Mr. D (who is actually Dionysus , god of wine and madness), reluctantly explains to Percy that he is a demigod , the son of a human and a Greek god (\"Another Terrible Day\"). Mr. Brunner (who is really Chiron , an immortal centaur), is also at the camp and explains to Percy that the gods will send a sign to claim him. However, Percy is still skeptical and angry that his father has never shown any sign of interest in him at all. Luke Castellan, the son of Hermes, sympathizes with Percy, telling him that many half-bloods never know their godly parents, as they are not claimed (\"Their Sign\").\n\nPercy settles in and meets several other campers such as Silena Beauregard (a daughter of Aphrodite ), Katie Gardner (a daughter of Demeter ), Clarisse La Rue (a daughter of Ares , who immediately dislikes Percy), and Annabeth Chase (a daughter of Athena , who took care of Percy while he was unconscious). Annabeth quickly takes the helm as leader during a game of capture the flag, instructing Percy to sit and wait in the boys' bathroom so he won't \"mess things up\". Clarisse singles him out and tries to \"pulverize\" him, but the toilets unexpectedly burst and soak her (\"Put You in Your Place\"). After things settle down, the campers sit around a campfire and vent about their unsteady, and in some cases harmful, relationships with both their godly and mortal parents (\"The Campfire Song\").\n\nPercy is claimed as the son of Poseidon , god of the sea, and it is at once rumored that Zeus ' lightning bolt has been stolen, and Percy is the culprit. Percy is told he and two others must go on a quest to retrieve the bolt to prevent a war between the gods. He is also sent to receive a prophecy from the Oracle of Delphi (\"The Oracle\"). After the Oracle's prophecy, Percy is upset that he has to leave Camp Half-Blood for a quest that will be unsuccessful (\"Good Kid\"). Percy only accepts the quest because Luke hints that his mother will be in the Underworld - the location of the search - since Hades is now rumored to be the real thief. Annabeth and Grover force themselves into the quest, and after a pair of winged shoes is given to them by Luke, the three are thrust into the woods with little care and protection (\"Killer Quest!\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nPercy, Annabeth, and Grover reflect on the task they've been given, and vow to try their hardest, even if they may fail (\"Try\"). The three questers then escape a bus which was attacked by the three Furies. Just after blowing it up, they become hopelessly lost (\"Lost!\"). In a frantic decision, Percy suggests they should enter Aunty Em's Garden Gnome Emporium. The strange Auntie Em wants to take pictures of them, but she is revealed to be Medusa . Percy cuts off her head with his pen/sword Riptide, and, as a joke, sends the head by mail to the gods. Annabeth seems particularly upset with this run-in, so while Grover scouts out their surroundings, Percy questions her about it. She confesses that she has always been ignored by everyone around her, and is desperate for a chance to prove herself to Athena, her mother, and make the history books (\"My Grand Plan\").\n\nGrover returns with train tickets to St. Louis and they set off, encountering many dangers along the way such as a Chimera , nasty storms, and the Lotus Hotel and Casino. They also meet up with Ares, who gives them a lift to Nevada (\"Drive\"). While on a bus ride to Los Angeles, Percy has a dream of a man speaking with someone whom he refers to as \"my lord\". The powerful voice mentions sacrifices and brings up a name: Thalia (\"The Weirdest Dream Reprise\"). Percy wakes with a jolt and asks Grover if he has ever heard of someone named Thalia. Grover confesses that a few years ago he was sent to escort Luke, Annabeth, and Thalia Grace - Zeus's daughter - to camp. On the way there they were attacked, and Grover failed to save Thalia, who, sacrificing herself, was turned into the tree that protects the borders of Camp Half-Blood. Grover holds himself responsible and thinks Percy must be ashamed of him (\"The Tree on the Hill\"). Percy assures Grover that no matter who he is or what he does, Percy will always want him as a friend. Percy brings up that the Oracle said that he would fail the quest, but he, Grover, and Annabeth all reaffirm their devotion to one another (\"Try (Reprise)\").\n\nThe trio arrive in the Underworld, where they are given a tour of the horrors by Charon and several long-dead musicians (\"DOA\"). Percy realizes that the lightning bolt is hidden in his backpack, and the three work out how it could have gotten there. Percy is nearly dragged into Tartarus by the shoes Luke gave him, and the group is discovered. After a brief conversation with an innocent Hades, Percy withdraws the shell from his pocket and blows it, realizing it was from Poseidon. It opens a portal out of the Underworld. Vowing to return to save his mother, Percy, Annabeth, and Grover escape. Percy hypothesizes that Ares is the one who planted the bolt in his bag, and comes to terms with himself and his father. He declares himself a son of Poseidon, and with his powers over water and the help of Annabeth and Grover he bests Ares (\"Son of Poseidon\").\n\nThe trio return to the camp as heroes, but Percy couldn't be more troubled. He confides in Luke that he feels just as confused as before, and Luke tells him that he also felt that way after his own quest. Luke tells Percy that he is the lightning thief, and that he has teamed up with Kronos to get back at the gods, who he feels have done him wrong (\"The Last Day of Summer\"). Luke attacks Percy and flees. Percy declares that there will be a war, no matter how they try to stall it, but he and his friends will be prepared and do whatever it takes to fight it (\"Bring on the Monsters\").",

        "synopsis": "A freighter explodes off the coast of North Africa under mysterious circumstances. All hands are accounted for save for stowaways Jeff Peters and Orville 'Turkey' Jackson, the latter's smoking habit causing the explosion. Upon reaching land, Orville reminds Jeff of his promise to Aunt Lucy to take care of him, but Jeff says she died before he could agree to it. Conveniently, a camel appears, and they hitch a ride.\n\nAs Jeff and Orville make their way into the city, they are nearly run over by Arabs led by Sheik Mullay Kasim, who has come to propose to Princess Shalmar. Orville is approached by men carrying a mysterious woman in a veiled palanquin, and her hand takes his before they leave. While at a restaurant, Jeff and Orville plan to skip out on the bill, but a man takes Jeff aside and gives him some money. Jeff has sold Orville, and although he is initially angry, he eventually calms down after Jeff promises to buy him back. Two men then throw a hood over Orville and carry him off.\n\nJeff has a vision of Aunt Lucy, who shames him for selling Orville. He attempts to buy Orville back but discovers that he has been sold once again. Aunt Lucy then advises Jeff to find Orville and suggests that he sing his favorite song. Jeff walks and sings until a note and Orville's locket are thrown from the palace, warning him of danger. Jeff climbs over the palace wall and hears a woman singing. He sneaks in and finds Orville with Princess Shalmar and other beautiful girls.\n\nJeff storms into the palace but is caught by guards. Orville pretends not to know him, resulting in the princess dismissing everyone except Jeff. Orville then confesses to their engagement, but the princess reveals that she bought him and that her wise man advised her to marry him. The princess invites Jeff to stay, and Orville is waited on by girls, including Mihirmah, who confesses her love for him. Jeff confronts Orville, who then has him thrown out.\n\nLater, Jeff sings and attracts the princess, and they go for a walk. Mihirmah tries to convince Orville to leave with her. Jeff tells the princess that he should be the one marrying her, but Orville threatens him with a sword. The following day, Kasim threatens to kill Orville, but the princess takes him to the wise man, who reveals a prophecy: the first husband will die a violent death within a week of marriage, and the second will have a long and happy life. The princess declares that Orville is the first husband, and Kasim finally understands.\n\nOrville learns of the prophecy and runs off with Mihirmah, convincing Jeff that the princess actually loves him. That night, Aunt Lucy's spirit rebukes Orville. Princess Shalmar refuses to marry Jeff and sends Orville away to prepare for the wedding. Later, the wise man tells the princess and Jeff that he misread the stars and that the prophecy is incorrect. Jeff now understands why Orville wanted to avoid the marriage, and tells him that the princess has changed her mind. Meanwhile, Kasim learns of the news and rallies his men.\n\nPrincess Shalmar and Jeff decide to get married in the United States along with Orville and Mihirmah. However, Kasim intervenes and abducts the princess while giving Mihirmah to one of his men. Jeff and Orville attempt to use their 'patty-cake' routine on Kasim, but it fails, and they end up getting captured along with the girls.\n\nKasim leaves Jeff and Orville stranded in the desert and takes the women with him. While wandering in the desert, they discover an oasis near Kasim's camp. They try to sneak in but are caught. They then witness a clash between two sheiks and take advantage of the chaos to escape with the girls. The four board a boat back home. However, things take a dangerous turn when Orville causes an explosion while smoking in the powder room. Fortunately, they all survive by clinging onto a pile of wreckage near New York Harbor.",

        "synopsis": "The story begins with Hannah, a beautiful young teen, as she is completing her senior year of high school. Her Brooklyn neighborhood is falling apart and SING! is one of the only traditions that keep the neighborhood alive. Newly arrived teacher, Miss Lombardo grew up in the neighborhood and returned to be their SING! leader. One cold Christmas night, Miss Lombardo is leaving a neighborhood party when a young man hails her a cab, then attempts to mug her. In self-defense, she bites his hand to release his grip and he screams in pain and terror and flees. The cab driver jokes about not starting the meter yet.\n\nOn the first day back at school, Miss Lombardo runs into difficulty when her students are uninterested and misbehaved. One such student, named Dominic, gets scolded for bringing stolen watches to school and putting his feet up on the desk. On the day of SING! leader elections, Miss Lombardo recognizes Dominic as her mugger by the bandage on his hand and decides to blackmail him into being co-SING! leader of the Senior class along with Hannah, who was rightfully elected. The school kids work hard to plan their SING! productions. Hannah and Dominic clash along the way as Hannah uses traditional SING! planning strategies while Dominic wants to introduce the flavor of the youth in the neighborhood. In order to put Dominic and Hannah on the same page, Miss Lombardo suggests that Hannah accompany Dominic to a local club. At first, the two are equally hesitant but Hannah agrees on the terms that it is not a date.\n\nHowever, by the end of the night, Hannah uses Dominic to make her ex-boyfriend, Mickey, jealous, and due to this, Hannah and Dominic start seeing each other in a different light. Dominic accompanies Hannah on her walk home and the two share a romantic kiss. Once the two are finally uniting and getting along, the Dept. of Education informs the school that it will close forever at the end of the semester and therefore, there won't be enough resources for them to complete this year's SING!. This fuels the kids to work even harder on their productions and the neighborhood comes together even more to help finance the show, despite the school authorities' ban.\n\nJust as things are starting to look up, Dominic reluctantly accompanies his brother on a robbery of Hannah's mother's diner, their sole source of income which already was at risk of failure due to the school's upcoming closure. A classmate sees Dominic standing outside the diner at the time of the crime and informs Hannah about it. Devastated, Hannah confronts Dominic and he promises to get the money back for her. He then steals the money from his brother and returns it to the diner, restoring Hannah's faith in him. The recent events have discouraged Dominic from fulfilling his co-SING! leader duties and he had been skipping out on rehearsals. In a moment of great need as the senior's main performer is injured and knocked unconscious, Dominic steps in to save the show. He sheds his bad-boy demeanor and exceeds all expectations. The underclassmen and seniors perform to a record-high sold-out audience. At the end of the show, Hannah makes a moving speech motivating the community to rejoice and always remember that despite compromising circumstances, they completed a successful SING! and proved their community's worth.",

        "title": "Me and Juliet",
        "description": "Me and Juliet is a musical with music by Richard Rodgers , and lyrics and book by Oscar Hammerstein II . The sixth stage collaboration by Rodgers & Hammerstein , it tells a story of romance backstage at a long-running musical: assistant stage manager Larry woos chorus girl Jeanie behind the back of her electrician boyfriend, Bob. Me and Juliet premiered in 1953 and was considered a modest success \u2014 it ran for much of a year on Broadway and had a limited run in Chicago (altogether nearly 500 performances), and returned a small profit to its backers.\n\nRodgers had long wanted to write a musical comedy about the cast and crew backstage at a theatre. After Rodgers and Hammerstein had another hit with The King and I in 1951, Rodgers proposed the backstage project to his partner. Hammerstein was unenthusiastic, thinking the subject matter trivial, but agreed to do the project. The play required complex machinery, designed by Jo Mielziner , so that the audience could view action not only on the stage of the theatre where the show-within-the-show (also named Me and Juliet ) takes place, but in the wings and on the light bridge (high above the stage, from which the lighting technicians train spotlights) as well.\n\nWhen Me and Juliet began tryout performances in Cleveland , the duo realized  the show had problems with plot and staging. Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed to fix the difficulties with the plot, which the critics considered weak and uninteresting. The show was met with poor reviews, though Mielziner's staging won praise from audience and critics. The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales. Bill Hayes, the show's star, states in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass (2005):\n\nWith the exception of a short run in Chicago , there was no national tour, and the show has seldom been seen. A small-scale production was presented by London's Finborough Theatre in 2010.",
        "synopsis": "The entire action of the show takes place in and close to a Broadway theatre in which the long-running musical Me and Juliet (the \" show-within-the-show \") is playing. The setting is the early 1950s.\n\n### Act 1\n\nA half-hour remains before the show is to begin. Electrician Sidney and chorus girl Jeanie are irritated at Sidney's fellow electrician, Bob, for not being there. Sidney needs Bob's help; Jeanie, Bob's girlfriend, is annoyed at being stood up. Sidney warns Jeanie that Bob may not be the right man for her; these are doubts she has too (Musical numbers: \"A Very Special Day\"/\"That's the Way it Happens\").\n\nJeanie leaves, and Bob appears. Bob tells Sidney he likes dating Jeanie, but does not plan to marry her. When Sidney jokes that Jeanie can do better than Bob, the larger man momentarily chokes him. Jeanie sees this, adding to her doubts about Bob. Larry, the assistant stage manager, is also attracted to Jeanie (reprise of \"That's the Way it Happens\").\n\nStage manager Mac sees to the final preparations, and the overture to the internal show is played by the orchestra, led by Dario, the conductor (\"Overture to Me and Juliet \"). The internal show's curtain rises (\"Marriage Type Love\"): the main male character, \"Me\" (performed by Charlie, a singer), tells the audience about the girl he wants to marry, Juliet (Lily, a singer). He also tells the audience of the girl he is determined not to marry, Carmen, who scares him. \"Me\" feels Carmen (the lead female dancing role) is better suited to his boss, Don Juan (the lead male dancer). As the internal show continues, Bob and Sidney are on the light bridge. Bob identifies with Don Juan for his reluctance to marry (\"Keep It Gay\").\n\nAnother day at Me and Juliet , and the dancers are rehearsing under Mac's supervision (conclusion of \"Keep It Gay\"). At Larry's urging, Jeanie decides to audition for the position of second understudy for the role of Juliet. On learning this, Mac takes Larry aside and warns him never to get involved with a cast member of a show while in charge of it. No sooner has Mac said this than his girlfriend Betty (currently in the show across the street) auditions for the role of Carmen. The producer gives her the role. As Larry looks on with amusement, Mac accepts this professionally, then stamps off in disgust.\n\nJeanie practices for her own audition (\"No Other Love\"), and Larry tells her that the audience will accept her if she's \"a real kid\" like Juliet, but reject her if she's a \"phony\" (\"The Big Black Giant\"). Larry desires a romance with Jeannie, but fears the larger and stronger Bob.\n\nSeveral months pass, during which Jeanie gets the job as second understudy. Larry and Jeanie are meeting secretly and keeping their budding romance from Bob. The rest of the cast is aware of their dates\u2014one dancer spotted them in a chili restaurant on Eighth Avenue .\n\nMac, true to his principles, has dumped Betty, but the two are still attracted to each other. Betty enjoys acting (\"It's Me\"). As she performs in the internal show, Bob and Sidney are on the light bridge again.\n\nBob has been fooled by Jeanie's lies about why they are not going out, and is enlightened when Sidney lets slip that Larry and Jeanie are seeing each other. Bob demands proof, and Sidney tells Bob to watch what happens in the wings during the upcoming Act 1 finale to Me and Juliet . Bob sees Larry and Jeanie kiss after she comes offstage with a tray of flowers, an action caught by Bob's spotlight . Mac enters, grasps the situation, sends Larry away, then puts the tray back in Jeanie's hands and pushes her onstage. She is pursued by Bob's spotlight, which relentlessly follows her around the stage as more and more of the dancers become aware something has gone badly wrong. Bob drops a sandbag from the light bridge; it knocks the tray Jeanie is holding to the ground. Mac orders the curtain lowered in front of a stage in panic.\n\n### Act 2\n\nIn the downstairs lounge, a few minutes before the Act 2 curtain for Me and Juliet rises, the ushers comment on the remarkable conclusion to Act 1\u2014although the audience has noticed nothing unusual (\"Intermission Talk\"). As Act 2 of the internal show starts, an enraged Bob is searching the theatre for Jeannie and Larry. Unable to find them, he takes up position at a bar across the street where he can watch the theatre doors (\"It Feels Good\"). The perspective shifts to the onstage action in Me and Juliet , where Don Juan and Carmen are on a date (\"We Deserve Each Other\"), before moving to the manager's office where Larry and Jeanie are hiding out (\"I'm Your Girl\"). Mac has only just begun his lecture to them when Bob enters through the window, having heard familiar voices. In the ensuing fight, Bob knocks out Mac, but when the electrician grabs for Jeannie, Larry strongly defends her. The fight ends when Bob accidentally hits his head on a radiator and is knocked out as well.\n\nRuby, the company manager, sends Larry and Jeannie down to the stage to continue the play. After Bob and Mac recover, Ruby informs Bob that Larry and Jeanie had secretly married earlier that day, and the surprised electrician leaves. Mac, fearful of more mayhem, goes in search of him. As Mac exits, the phone rings, and Ruby takes the call. It is the producer, calling for Mac to transfer him to another show, thereby setting him free to resume his romance with Betty.\n\nOnstage, Me and Juliet is concluding. After the internal show finishes (\"Finale to Me and Juliet \"), Larry, who will be the new stage manager, insists on rehearsing a scene from the show. Seeing Bob enter with a scowl, Larry orders him and Sidney to be present the next morning to re-angle the lights. Taken aback, and rather sheepishly, Bob says \"I didn't know you were married\" before quietly leaving, after stating, \"I'll be here, I guess.\" Jeanie is congratulated by her showmates, but Larry, all business, waves them to their places to rehearse the scene. As Lily has had to leave, Jeanie stands in for her as Juliet, while Larry sings the part of Me in the scene, as the curtain falls (\"Finale of Our Play\").",

The day starts fine but Elsa suddenly starts developing symptoms of a cold . With each sneeze, Elsa unknowingly produces a group of \" Snowgies \",  little snow-babies who begin to dismantle the birthday party's decorations while Kristoff and Sven try to stop them and Olaf embraces them.\n\nElsa brushes away Anna's growing concern regarding her constant sneezing, assuring her she \"[does not] get colds\" and enthusiastically continuing the treasure hunt. Meanwhile, Anna is visibly struggling under the weight of all the extravagant presents she has found from the hunt and Elsa's condition is rapidly worsening. Anna recognises her sister is delirious with a fever as they climb the clock tower to Elsa's final present, two figures of the sisters as part of the hourly clocktower procession. Now completely delirious and wobbly, Elsa starts teetering dangerously close to the edge of the platform, before falling. Anna races forward and grabs her sister's wrist, pulling her back to safety. Reluctantly, Elsa admits she is suffering from a cold and that she needs to go home and rest in bed.\n\nThey walk back to the castle where Elsa apologizes to Anna for \"ruining\" another birthday, but Anna reassures her that she did not ruin anything, despite having a fever. As Anna goes to lead Elsa to bed, the doors to the castle open to reveal Kristoff, Olaf, Sven, and a mountain of Snowgies, who surprise Anna. Elsa sneezes again and finally notices the little snow-people she has been inadvertently creating all day. The cake is served and everyone celebrates Princess Anna\u2019s birthday. Despite her sister's protests, Elsa concludes the party by blowing into an alphorn , but she sneezes into the horn, forming a giant snowball that inadvertently and accidentally hits Hans overseas into a cart of manure, as he was cleaning out the stables.\n\nElsa rests in bed under Anna's care while she points out that taking care of her beloved big sister is the best birthday present she could have been given. Olaf, Kristoff, and Sven escort the Snowgies to Elsa's former ice palace, where they stay with the palace's snow-giant doorkeeper and current owner Marshmallow .",

        "synopsis": "### Prologue: The Launching\n\nTitanic' s designer, Thomas Andrews marvels at the wondrous things mankind has accomplished (\"In Every Age\"); with the R.M.S. Titanic becoming the newest feat once thought impossible. Stoker Fred Barrett arrives at the dock in Southampton , amazed by the feat of engineering (\"How Did They Build Titanic ?\").  He is joined by Lookout Frederick Fleet and wireless telegraph operator Harold Bride , and they gaze in awe at the \"Ship of Dreams\" (\"There She Is\") as the crew arrives. Bruce Ismay , Andrews, and Captain Edward Smith congratulate each other on being the owner, designer, and captain of \"The Largest Moving Object\" in the world.  The ship's passengers arrive; the Third and Second Class passengers feel privileged to be aboard the maiden voyage of the grandest ship ever to sail (\"I Must Get on that Ship\").  The First Class passengers arrive; their names and achievements are narrated by Second Class passenger Alice Beane (\"1st Class Roster\").  The Titanic sets sail, and the assembled company wishes her a safe crossing (\"Godspeed Titanic\").\n\n### Act 1\n\nNow at sea, Ismay arrives on the bridge to inform Smith that he plans for the Titanic to arrive in New York on Tuesday afternoon rather than Wednesday morning, while Andrews insists that the maiden voyage be a safe one.  As they've cleared land, Smith allows her speed to be increased slightly.  Barrett, in the boiler room, disagrees with the order on such a new ship, but nonetheless complies (\"Barrett's Song\").\n\nAs the voyage continues, Ismay demands increasingly more speed, so the ship can build an impressive reputation. Smith complies despite Andrews' objections and warnings of icebergs in their course.\n\nIn Second Class, Alice Beane longs for the grandeur that is First Class, while her husband Edgar, a successful hardware store owner, is content with their station.  Charles Clarke, who is traveling to America to become a journalist, is accompanied by his fianc\u00e9e Caroline Neville. Caroline's father doesn't approve of the engagement, so they are eloping to America.\n\nMeanwhile, in First Class, the titans of industry recount the accomplishments that man has recently achieved, with the Titanic becoming the pinnacle. (\"What a Remarkable Age This Is!\").\n\nOn the bridge, Smith hails 1st Officer Murdoch 's qualities, deeming him ready to assume a command of his own, but Murdoch feels he is not yet ready to handle the responsibilities of the job (\"To Be a Captain\").\n\nIn steerage , three Irish lasses\u2014each named Kate\u2014dream with the rest of Third Class of the opportunities that await them in America (\"Lady's Maid\").  Kate McGowan is smitten with a young man traveling with them, Jim Farrell.\n\nIn the wireless room, Bride is overwhelmed by the passengers' personal messages to be sent, though he finds time to handle Barrett's proposal to his girlfriend (\"The Proposal/The Night Was Alive\").\n\nOn Sunday morning, the First Class attends religious services (\"God Lift Me Up\"), then dances on deck to \"The Latest Rag\".  Alice Beane has managed to infiltrate their ranks, though she is turned away several times by an alert steward.  Edgar finds her and the two argue over their lifestyle choices (\"I Have Danced\").  As evening draws near, the temperature drops, and lookout Fleet finds the weather conditions difficult for spotting icebergs (\"No Moon\").  On deck, Kate McGowan tells Farrell that she needs to marry as she is carrying the child of a married man, and he accepts.  Elderly passengers Isidor and Ida Straus discuss their plans for the years to come while Charlotte Drake Cardoza scandalizes the First Class men by joining them for cards in the First Class Smoke Room (\"Autumn\").\n\nSuddenly, Fleet spots an iceberg and alerts the bridge.  Murdoch, who's the senior officer on the bridge, takes evasive action, but the Titanic strikes the iceberg.\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe stewards begin waking the confused passengers, while they themselves do not have much information (\"Wake Up, Wake Up\").  Capt. Smith arrives on the bridge and is briefed on the situation.  He orders all passengers to put on life vests, for Bride to begin sending distress messages, and for Andrews to inspect the damage.  Andrews informs Smith and Ismay that the damage inflicted is more than the ship is designed to endure and that the ship will sink, reminding them that there are only enough lifeboats for less than half of the people aboard.\n\nIn the First Class Dining Salon, passengers refuse to believe that anything is wrong with the ship and are annoyed at being awakened in the middle of the night (\"Dressed in Your Pyjamas in the Grand Salon\").  Crew members are assuring them that there is no reason to panic. No one is aware of the ship's growing peril until a food cart rolls on its own, showing the ship's growing tilt. All the passengers and crew members quickly hurry to the lifeboats.\n\nIn Third Class, the three Kates and Farrell attempt to find a way up to boat deck, but are unable to until they are assisted by Barrett (\"The Staircase\"). Smith arrives in the radio room where Bride informs him that only the Carpathia is near enough to help, but is unable to arrive until after the Titanic has sunk.  Smith, Andrews, and Ismay argue over responsibility for the disaster (\"The Blame\").\n\nWomen and children are ordered into the lifeboats, while the men are forced to stay behind (\"To the Lifeboats\").  Murdoch orders Fleet and Barrett into the last lifeboat to help man the oars, but Barrett doesn't know how to row a boat and lets Farrell, who can row, into the boat instead.  Barrett bids farewell to his absent girlfriend while the rest of the passengers do the same to their loved ones (\"We'll Meet Tomorrow\").\n\nThe bellboy tells the captain that all the life boats have been launched, and that those remaining aboard accept their fate. Murdoch tells the Captain that he takes full responsibility for the accident, but Smith forgives him and then laments on how he had gone his entire career without experiencing any accident. Henry Etches, the first class steward, says a prayer (\"To Be A Captain\" (Reprise)). Isidor and Ida Straus (Ida had refused to leave her husband behind) affirm their long-lasting love for one another (\"Still\").  As the Captain declares the ship officially lost, Andrews\u2014life vest unworn\u2014remains in the first-class smoking room, obsessing over the ship's plans. He visualizes redesigning her, as well as the final moments for the passengers before the ship sinks beneath the waves (\"Mr. Andrews' Vision\").\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, the survivors are rescued by the Carpathia .  Many of them recount the tragedy of the Titanic , mourning the loss of people and ship.  Bride and Ismay, along with several of the survivors, discuss the possibilities that could have prevented the disaster (\"The Foundering\").  The survivors express hope that they will one day be reunited with their lost loved ones and abandoned dreams (\"In Every Age/Finale\").",

        "title": "Labyrinth (1986 film)",
        "description": "Labyrinth is a 1986 musical fantasy film directed by Jim Henson from a screenplay by Terry Jones based on a story conceived by Henson and Dennis Lee . A co-production between Henson Associates and Lucasfilm with George Lucas serving as executive producer, the film stars Jennifer Connelly as teenager Sarah and David Bowie as Jareth , and follows Sarah's journeys through a maze to save her baby brother from the Goblin King.\n\nLabyrinth started as a collaboration between Henson and Brian Froud following their previous collaboration The Dark Crystal (1982). Jones of Monty Python wrote the first draft of the film's script early in 1984, drawing on Froud's sketches for inspiration. The screenplay underwent several revisions by Laura Phillips, Lucas, Lee, and Elaine May \u2014although Jones received the film's sole screenwriting credit. It was shot from April to September 1985 on location in Upper Nyack , Piermont , and Haverstraw, New York , and at Elstree Studios and West Wycombe Park in the United Kingdom. The film's fantastical creatures were designed by Froud and created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop .\n\nThe New York Times reported that Labyrinth had a budget of $25 million. The film underperformed at the United States box office , grossing $12.9 million during its US theatrical run. However, it was a success in the United Kingdom and overseas, grossing over $34 million worldwide. Labyrinth was first met with a mixed critical response upon its release, which contributed to a difficult period of Henson's career, according to his son Brian Henson . It was the last feature film that Henson directed, and over the years it has been re-evaluated by many critics. A success on home video and television broadcasts, Labyrinth has gained a large cult following .\n\nThe film has been adapted into a variety of media, including books, video games, board games and comics. Tokyopop published a four-volume comic sequel Return to Labyrinth between 2006 and 2010, and Archaia Entertainment published a comic prequel Labyrinth: Coronation between 2018 and 2019. In January 2016, it was announced that a sequel was in development.",
        "synopsis": "While in the park with her dog, Merlin, 16-year-old Sarah Williams recites from a book titled The Labyrinth but is unable to remember the last line. Realizing that she is late to babysit her infant half-brother Toby, she rushes home and is confronted by her stepmother who goes out with Sarah's father for the night. Frustrated that Toby was given her treasured teddy bear , Lancelot, and annoyed by his constant crying, Sarah rashly wishes that Toby be taken away by the goblins from her book. Toby disappears and the Goblin King Jareth appears, offering Sarah her dreams in exchange for the baby. She refuses, instantly regretting her wish. Jareth reluctantly gives Sarah 13 hours to solve his labyrinth and find Toby before he is turned into a goblin forever. Jareth transports Sarah to a wasteland where she meets a dwarf named Hoggle who aids her in entering the labyrinth. As Sarah traverses the labyrinth, Jareth plays carelessly with Toby in his palace at the labyrinth's center.\n\nAfter falling down a trapdoor, Sarah ends up in an oubliette where she reunites with Hoggle. The two are confronted by Jareth, escape one of his traps, and encounter a troll named Ludo being tormented by goblins. Hoggle flees, while Sarah befriends Ludo after freeing him but loses him in a forest. Hoggle encounters Jareth, who instructs him to give an enchanted peach to Sarah, calling his loyalty into question, as he was supposed to take her back to the beginning of the labyrinth. Sarah is harassed by a group of creatures called The Fire Gang, but Hoggle comes to her aid. She kisses him, and they fall through a trapdoor that deposits them in a flatulent swamp called the \"Bog of Eternal Stench\" where they reunite with Ludo. The trio meet the guard of the swamp, the anthropomorphic fox terrier Sir Didymus and his Old English Sheepdog \"steed\" Ambrosius. Sarah begins crossing a bridge over the bog, but it collapses, and Ludo summons a trail of rocks to save her. Sir Didymus joins the group as they leave the bog. Hoggle gives a hungry Sarah the enchanted peach and runs away as she falls into a trance and forgets her quest. She dreams of a masquerade ball and sees Jareth in the crowd. She approaches him, and the two dance together, but Sarah is reminded of her quest when she sees a clock. She runs, escaping the trance and falling into a junkyard outside the Goblin City near Jareth's castle. An old Junk Lady fails to trick Sarah, who regains her memory and rejoins Ludo and Sir Didymus. They are confronted by the humongous, robotic gate guard, but Hoggle comes to their rescue. Despite Hoggle feeling unworthy of forgiveness for his betrayal, Sarah and the others welcome him back, and together they enter the city.\n\nJareth is alerted to the group's presence and sends his goblin army to stop them. Ludo summons a multitude of rocks to chase the goblins away, and they enter the castle. Sarah insists she must face Jareth alone and promises to call the others if needed. In a room modeled after M. C. Escher 's Relativity , she confronts Jareth while trying to retrieve Toby. She recites the lines from her book that mirror her adventure up to that point, but she still cannot remember the last line. Jareth offers Sarah her dreams again, but she remembers the final line: \"You have no power over me!\" Defeated at the last second, Jareth returns Sarah and Toby home, turns into a barn owl , and flies away.\n\nRealizing how important Toby is to her, Sarah gives him Lancelot and returns to her room as her father and stepmother return home. She sees her friends in the mirror and admits that, even though she has grown up, she still needs them in her life, whereupon the labyrinth characters appear in her room for a raucous reunion party, hugging each other in joy. Jareth, in his barn owl form, watches their celebration from outside and then flies off into the moonlight.",

        "description": "Nine is a musical initiated by and with music and lyrics by Maury Yeston and a book by Arthur Kopit . Based on the film 8\u00bd , it tells the story of film director Guido Contini, who is dreading his imminent 40th birthday and facing a midlife crisis , which is blocking his creative impulses and entangling him in a web of romantic difficulties in early-1960s Venice .\n\nConceived and written and composed by Yeston as a class project in the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop in 1973, it was later adapted with a book by Mario Fratti, and then with another book by Arthur Kopit . The original Broadway production opened in 1982 and ran for 729 performances, starring Raul Julia . The musical won five Tony Awards (including Best Musical ) and has enjoyed a number of revivals.\n\nA film adaptation was released in 2009.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nGuido Contini, a famous Italian film director, has turned forty and faces double crises: he has to shoot a film for which he can't write the script, and his wife of twenty years, the film star Luisa del Forno, may be about to leave him if he can't pay more attention to their marriage.\n\nLuisa's efforts to talk to him are drowned out by voices in his head: voices of women in his life whom he has loved (\"Overture delle Donne\").\n\nIn an attempt to find some peace and save the marriage, they go to a spa near Venice (\"Spa Music\"), where they are immediately hunted down by the press with intrusive questions about their marriage and Guido's imminent film project, which he has not told Luisa about (\"Not Since Chaplin\").\n\nAs Guido struggles to find a story for his film, he becomes increasingly preoccupied, his interior world sometimes becoming indistinguishable from reality (\"Guido's Song\"). His mistress Carla arrives in Venice, calling him from her hotel room (\"A Call from the Vatican\"). His producer Liliane La Fleur, former vedette of the Folies Bergeres, insists he make a musical, an idea which veers off into a vivid fantasy (\"The Script / Folies Bergeres\"). All the while, Luisa watches, the resilience of her love being consumed by anxiety for him and a gathering dismay about their life together (\"My Husband Makes Movies / Only With You\").\n\nIn Guido's imagination, he encounters his mother bathing a nine-year-old boy\u2014his own young self (\"Nine\"). The vision leads him to re-encounter a moment on a beach with Saraghina, a prostitute to whom he went as a curious child, sneaking out of his Catholic boarding school St. Sebastian, to ask her to tell him about love. Her answer, to be yourself (\"Ti Voglio Bene / Be Italian\"), and the dance she taught him reminds the forty-year-old Guido of the consequences of that night\u2014punishment by the nuns and rejection by his mother (\"The Bells of St. Sebastian\"). Unable to bear the adults, the little boy runs back to the beach to find no one.\n\n### Act II\n\nBack into the present, Guido is on a beach once more. With him is Claudia Nardi, a film star and his muse, who has flown in from Paris for him; however, she does not want the role. He is enraged by her rejection. Claudia loves him but wants him to love her as a person and not a \"spirit\", which he cannot do. She calls him \"My charming Casanova!\", thereby involuntarily giving Guido the inspiration he needs (\"A Man Like You\"). Claudia lets him go (\"Unusual Way\"), Guido has an idea for a movie set on the Grand Canal and cast with every woman in his life (\"The Grand Canal\").\n\nDuring the filming of the movie, Carla races onto the set to announce her divorce and her delight that they can be married, only to be rejected by Guido in his fixation on the film. Luisa is enraged and saddened by his use of their intimacy and her words as a source for the film. Guido keeps the cameras rolling, capturing the desolation of the women he loves (\"Cut, Print!\").\n\nThe film is dead. Carla leaves with a broken heart (\"Simple\"). Claudia sends a letter from Paris to say that she has married. Luisa ends their marriage (\"Be On Your Own\").\n\nGuido is alone and directionless, contemplating suicide (\"I Can't Make This Movie\"). As the gun is at his head, he is interrupted by his nine-year-old self telling him it is time to grow up and move on, and Guido surrenders the gun (\"Getting Tall\"). The women return, this time to let him go, with the exception of Luisa (\"Reprises\"). Guido feels the aching void left by the only woman he will ever love. In the 2003 Broadway production, as the boy leads the women off, Luisa steps into the room on the final note, and Guido turns toward her.",

Intercut with the vignettes in which their lives unfold are several recreations of the melodramatic short stories Jo writes in her attic studio.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn 1865, Josephine March (Jo) receives a notice of rejection from a publisher; it is her twenty-second rejection. Jo asks Professor Bhaer, another boarder at Mrs. Kirk's boarding house , his opinion on her story (\"An Operatic Tragedy\"). The professor is not impressed by her story, telling her that he thinks that she can write something better. Jo, taken aback and angry at Bhaer's reaction, asks him what he knows to give him the right to criticize her and insults him by calling him old. He reacts by saying that he is stating his opinion and leaves. Jo, left alone, wonders what could be better than the story she has written, then muses that perhaps her writing was better when she was at home in Concord, Massachusetts (\"Better\").\n\nTwo years earlier in her attic studio, Jo assembles her sisters, Meg, Beth, and Amy, to tell them that she will be putting on a show of her own called the \"Operatic Tragedy\". The sisters beg Jo to not make the show but Jo convinces them that this play will be a hit and will make for the best Christmas ever (\"Our Finest Dreams\"). Marmee, their mother, comes in with a letter from their father, who is away as a Union army chaplain in the American Civil War . As Marmee writes a response, she reflects on how hard it is to be the pillar of strength in the March home (\"Here Alone\").\n\nAunt March, the sisters' wealthy aunt, asks Jo to change from being a tomboy to a model lady of society. She tells Jo she is considering bringing her along to Europe . Jo begs to go with her, but Aunt March says that she will take her only if she changes. Jo, who has always dreamed of seeing Europe, agrees (\"Could You?\"). Meanwhile, Meg has one of her own dreams realized: she and Jo are invited to Annie Moffat's Valentine's Day Ball. On the day of the ball, while the two sisters are getting ready, Meg decides that she cannot go. She asks Marmee what she should say when one of her potential suitors asks her to dance. Marmee tells Meg to just smile and say \"I'd be delighted\" (\"Delighted\"). Amy, who cares about society life more than Jo, rushes down in Jo's old ball gown to join them in going to the ball, but Jo stops her as she is not invited. Spiteful, Amy burns Jo's manuscript in the fireplace.\n\nAt the ball, Jo accidentally sits on Laurie, who is a neighbor of the Marches' along with his grumpy grandfather, Mr. Laurence. Laurie's tutor, Mr. Brooke, comes in and scolds Laurie for not meeting important people, which will make Mr. Laurence angry. Mr. Brooke accidentally takes Meg's dance card ; when he returns it, he sees how beautiful she is, asks her to dance, and Meg agrees. Meg and Mr. Brooke are smitten with each other at first sight. Laurie confesses to Jo his need for friends and asks Jo to dance with him. Jo replies that she doesn't dance but Laurie keeps trying (\"Take A Chance On Me\").\n\nBack at the Marches' after the ball, Jo and Amy have a confrontation after Jo discovers what Amy has done to her manuscript. Marmee sends Amy to bed and apologizes to Jo, but tells her that Amy is just a child and wants to be like Jo. Jo rushes up to the attic to rewrite her story (\"Better (Reprise)\"). Laurie invites Jo to a skating race, which she at first refuses but eventually agrees to. Amy wants to go with them but has already outgrown her skates . Beth, who intends to stay home, offers Amy her old skates.\n\nBeth is sitting at the family's old piano when Mr. Laurence comes in looking for Laurie. Mr. Laurence discovers Beth's talent at the piano and they sing a duet (\"Off to Massachusetts\"). Jo and Laurie come in from the skating race with Laurie carrying Amy because she fell through the ice while skating. Jo and Amy reconcile, and Jo makes Laurie an honorary member of the March family (\"Five Forever\").\n\nMarmee receives a letter informing her that her husband has contracted pneumonia and she must go to Washington to be with him. As Marmee prepares to leave and Amy packs her things to stay with Aunt March, Jo returns with money for Marmee to travel, but confesses that she did not go to Aunt March; she tried to sell her stories in the town common, but ended up cutting and selling her hair. When Aunt March arrives to pick up Amy, she sees Jo and is furious. Jo has a confrontation with Aunt March, ending with Aunt March deciding not to take Jo to Europe after all. Aunt March then turns her focus to Amy, intending to mold her into the society life that she envisioned for Jo. Mr. Brooke tells Meg of his enlistment in the Union army. He then asks Meg for her hand in marriage, and she accepts (\"More Than I Am\").\n\nMonths later, Laurie returns to Concord and visits Jo, who is happy to see him. Laurie tells her that his grandfather has enrolled him in college and that he will be leaving in time for the summer session. Laurie begins to confess his feelings for Jo and kisses her (\"Take A Chance On Me (Reprise)\"). He put out a ring and tells Jo he loves her. Jo does not accept his marriage proposal and is upset by his words. He tells her that she will marry eventually, but Jo tells him that she will not; Laurie says she will, but not to him. Jo ponders her future, vowing to find another way to achieve her dreams (\"Astonishing\").\n\n### Act II\n\nAt Mrs. Kirk's boarding house in New York City , she is holding a telegram for Jo from Mrs. March. Jo runs in, looking for Professor Bhaer and finding him right in front of her. She has news of her first sale as an author (\"The Weekly Volcano Press\"). She tells them the story of the sale as well; following Professor Bhaer's advice, she embellished the story. When Jo reads the telegram, she is notified that Beth contracted scarlet fever and immediately packs her bags to return to Concord.\n\nJo, after a few days, sends a letter to Professor Bhaer, asking him what's new in New York. The professor struggles to write a decent response (\"How I Am\"). With her new earnings, Jo takes Marmee and Beth to Cape Cod . When Marmee leaves to write to her husband, Beth and Jo put together a kite that Jo got for Beth and they fly it in the air. Beth tells Jo that she is not afraid to die, but says that the hardest part is leaving Jo (\"Some Things Are Meant To Be\"). Beth dies soon after.\n\nAmy and Aunt March return home from Europe. Laurie also returns home from Europe and sees Jo for the first time in a long time. Jo tells Laurie that she has missed him and that she sold a story; Laurie tells her that she was always meant to \"fly on golden wings,\" and that he was not. Amy comes to them and Amy and Laurie struggle to tell Jo of their impending marriage because they do not wish for Jo to be upset (\"The Most Amazing Thing\").\n\nJo, grieving Beth's death, finds herself unable to write another story. Marmee tells Jo of how she copes with Beth's death, telling Jo that she must move forward for Beth's sake (\"Days of Plenty\"). Jo reminisces about her sisters. Her thoughts of her family and friends inspire her to write her novel, \"Little Women\" (\"The Fire Within Me\").\n\nOn the day of Laurie and Amy's wedding, Professor Bhaer comes to Concord to see Jo and she is surprised to see him. He tells Jo of his feelings for her (\"Small Umbrella In The Rain\"). He proposes to her and Jo accepts his proposal. He tells Jo that he sent the manuscript of her novel to Henry Dashwood, the editor of The Weekly Volcano Press. He tells Jo that the publisher agreed to publish it, and Jo proclaims her happiness. As Marmee comes outside and brings Professor Bhaer in, Jo takes a moment to reflect on her life (\"Volcano (Reprise)\"). Professor Bhaer then comes back out and tells Jo they're all waiting for her inside. Jo goes to Bhaer, takes his hand, and goes inside the house.",

They meet up with kindly Professor Marvel, who subtly convinces Dorothy to return home. Suddenly a tornado hits, and Dorothy and Toto, seeking shelter in the house, are transported to the Land of Oz.\n\nIn Oz, Dorothy meets Glinda, the Good Witch of the North .

The foursome and Toto are reunited, but the Wicked Witch interferes, threatening the Scarecrow with fire. Dorothy, dousing the flames with a bucket of water, accidentally strikes the Witch, who smolders and melts into nothing (\"Ding Dong the Witch Is Dead\" (reprise)). The four friends, triumphant, take the Witch's broom back to the Wizard.\n\nThe Wizard remains imperious and imposing, but Toto pulls aside a curtain to reveal a meek and ordinary man speaking into a microphone. The Wizard, revealed to be a \"humbug\", nonetheless grants each traveler's request, giving the Scarecrow, the Tinman, and the Lion each a token of his newly-acquired ability. The Wizard offers to take Dorothy back to Kansas in his hot-air balloon, but the balloon accidentally takes off, and Dorothy is left alone and crestfallen. Glinda appears and explains that Dorothy has always had the power to return home. All she has to do is close her eyes, tap her heels together three times, and repeat to herself, \"There's no place like home.\"\n\nBack in Kansas, Dorothy awakens, confused, with a bump on her head. Reunited with all her loved ones, and relieved to learn the storm has left Miss Gulch incapacitated by a broken leg, Dorothy shares the tale of her miraculous journey, celebrating the joy and healing power of home.",

        "description": "The Woman in White is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber , lyrics by David Zippel, and a book by Charlotte Jones. It is based on the 1860 novel by Wilkie Collins , as well as on elements of the 1866 short story \" The Signal-Man \" by Charles Dickens .\n\nIt ran for nineteen months in the West End and three months on Broadway , making it one of Lloyd Webber's shortest-running shows.",
        "synopsis": "On a midnight train trip on the way to Limmeridge House as a drawing teacher, Walter Hartright sees a strange woman dressed entirely in white, apparently fleeing from someone and desperate to share a terrible secret with him. The signalman is scared because although he saw no-one, it was predicted a year earlier that in a 'year to this day', someone would be found dead on the railway track (\"Prologue\").\n\nWalter meets his new students: Marian Halcombe and her pretty half-sister Laura Fairlie, who is heir to the estate which includes Limmeridge House (\"I Hope You Like It Here\"). He tells them about his encounter, and they resolve to solve the mystery (\"Perspective\").\n\nA love triangle develops as Walter and Laura quickly fall in love but Marian also falls for Walter and those feelings are not reciprocated (\"I\u2019m Trying Not To Notice It\"/\"I Believe My Heart\"). The peasants on the Limmeridge Estate sing and dance to celebrate the harvest. A girl is excluded from the festival because her mother believes her to be 'telling tales'. She tells Hartright of a ghost of a woman in all white (\"Lammastide\"). Hartright goes to the graveyard where the child saw the 'ghost' and meets Anne Catherick, who tells him her name and the name of the man who she is scared of: \"Sir Percival Glyde\". Marian tells Walter that Laura is engaged to a man of 'titled property': Sir Percival Glyde. Later Glyde arrives at Limmeridge, pretending to be a long-standing friend to Marian. He suggests that they move the wedding up from spring to Christmas and Laura eventually agrees.\n\nCount Fosco, Glyde's friend and best man for the wedding, arrives and becomes attracted to Marian (\"You See I Am No Ghost\").\n\nWhen questioned by Walter about Anne Catherick, Glyde tells him that she is mad. He mentions that he tried to help her, and she thinks that he is her enemy. Laura is reluctant to marry Glyde, but Marian encourages her to honor her father's dying wish. Walter receives all this news angrily and leaves for London, but not before Laura returns a picture he drew of her (\"Gift For Living Well\"). Laura and Glyde are married. Anne Catherick decides to travel to Laura's side to help her, because she insists that Glyde 'knows no mercy'.\n\nMarian moves into Blackwater House, Glyde's estate. Laura becomes angry and distrustful of Marian because her advice led her to marry a man whom she discovers to be a physically abusive husband; he only wants her for her money, to pay off his debt (\"The Holy and the Ivy\"). Marian is determined to free Laura from this ill-fated marriage (\"All For Laura\").\n\nThe next day, Glyde presents Laura with a document to sign, but he will not tell her its contents. Laura is immediately suspicious, and refuses to sign something she knows nothing about. Glyde is furious, but cannot force her to sign the document (\"The Document\"). The girls go for a walk to calm down, and meet Anne Catherick. They witness Anne being taken back to the Asylum. They are then completely convinced that Glyde and his friend Fosco are villains. Laura and Anne realize how similar they are to each other (\"Act 1 Finale\").\n\nMarian eavesdrops on Sir Percival and Count Fosco, and overhears their evil plans to steal the Limmeridge Estate. She also overhears their plans for Anne Catherick, but Count Fosco figures out that he is being watched before he reveals anything important about the madwoman. He leaves the library to put Marian to bed (\"If I Could Only Dream This World Away\"). Marian, having gone to bed, starts to dream a montage of events that have occurred recently, mixed in with some noises. The noises, though not apparent to Marian, are actually Laura arguing and screaming (\"The Nightmare\").\n\nMarian shortly is woken up by Count Fosco, who tells her that Laura was walking in her sleep and fell out the window. Marian is quite shaken by the tragic news. Fosco, avoiding drama, heads off to his house in London. However, being infatuated with Marian, he gives her his address in case she needs anything. At the village funeral Glyde suggests to Mr Fairlie that they get to the papers that need to be attended to. In a show of grief Glyde tries to shake Marian's hand but she ignores him, but vowing revenge for her sister she heads to find Walter.\n\nIn London, Walter has run out of money and gives his last coin to a beggar (\"Fosco Tells of Laura\u2019s Death\"/\"The Funeral\"/\"London\"). Having heard the news through the grapevine of Laura's death, Walter expresses his grief at losing the love of his life (\"Evermore Without You\"). Coincidentally, Glyde, who is frustrated with paperwork, also shares Walter's feelings for Laura. Marian goes to London in search of Walter (\"Lost Souls\").\n\nWhen Marian finds Walter, he joins her in her quest to learn the secret of Anne Catherick and avenge Laura's death. Marian believes that Anne's location is in a document that she witnessed Count Fosco sign the night she eavesdropped. Meanwhile, Glyde is happily betting the money that he has not yet received, which infuriates Fosco and leads to a split in their friendship. Marian and Walter are ready to leave for their visit to Count Fosco's. Marian is dressed specifically with the intent to use her feminine wiles against Fosco, which makes Walter suddenly realize his true feelings for her (\"If Not For Me For Her\"). Fosco, pleased with his part in the manipulation of everyone, gloats to himself and his pet mice (\"You Can Get Away With Anything\").\n\nMarian and Walter go to Fosco's home to retrieve the document, where he attempts to seduce Marian, not realizing that she is purposefully playing along. She sends him to the bathroom to shave as a diversion, whilst she searches for the document. She finds it, and discovers the location of Anne's asylum. When Fosco returns from the bathroom he discovers that Marian is visiting for another purpose. A rejected Fosco admits if Marian were really interested in him, he would have proposed marriage (\"The Seduction\").\n\nMarian and Walter go to the asylum to get the secret from Anne Catherick. However, when they arrive at Anne's cell, they find not Anne but Laura. Laura explains that Glyde put Laura in Anne's place at the asylum, killed Anne, then buried her in Laura's grave. In desperation the threesome head to Limmeridge House to try to learn the secret from Mr. Fairlie, who knows more about Anne Catherick than he says he does (\"The Asylum\").\n\nMeanwhile, Sir Percival Glyde has convinced Mr. Fairlie to give the Limmeridge Estate to him because he was married to Laura. Fairlie signs the document and Glyde goes off to catch a train.\n\nMarian, Laura and Walter arrive at Limmeridge House after Glyde has left for the train. Mr. Fairlie reveals that Anne Catherick is in fact Laura's half-sister, and they look identical. Marian tells him of the conspiracy, but Fairlie sadly tells her that he already signed the document. The three run to the train to stop Glyde from getting away (\"Back to Limmeridge\").\n\nWhile still in Anne's white clothing, Laura pretends to be Anne and attempts to haunt Glyde if he does not tell the truth about the secret. \"I had to drown your bastard child!\" he exclaims. Laura reads between the lines and figures out the secret: Glyde had raped Anne, and drowned their child at Blackwater Lake. He tries to kill Laura to silence her but is run over by a train. The signalman's prediction comes true, but it is Glyde, not Walter, who lies dead on the tracks. Walter and Laura are happily married, Walter inherits Limmeridge House, and Marian is left heartbroken (\"Finale\").",

        "description": "Porgy and Bess ( / \u02c8 p \u0254\u02d0r \u0261 i / PORG -ee ) is an English-language opera by American composer George Gershwin , with a libretto written by author DuBose Heyward and lyricist Ira Gershwin . It was adapted from Dorothy Heyward and DuBose Heyward's play Porgy , itself an adaptation of DuBose Heyward's 1925 novel Porgy .\n\nPorgy and Bess was first performed in Boston on September 30, 1935, before it moved to Broadway in New York City. It featured a cast of classically trained African-American singers\u2014a daring artistic choice at the time. A 1976 Houston Grand Opera production gained it a renewed popularity, and it is now one of the best known and most frequently performed operas.\n\nThe libretto of Porgy and Bess tells the story of Porgy, a disabled black street beggar living in the slums of Charleston . It deals with his attempts to rescue Bess from the clutches of Crown, her violent and possessive lover, and Sportin' Life, her drug dealer. The opera plot generally follows the stage play.\n\nIn the years following Gershwin's death, Porgy and Bess was adapted for smaller-scale performances. It was adapted as a film in 1959. Some of the songs in the opera, such as \" Summertime \", became popular and are frequently recorded. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the trend has been toward productions with greater fidelity to Gershwin's original intentions, though smaller-scale productions also continue to be mounted. A complete recorded version of the score was released in 1976; since then, it has been recorded several times.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nScene 1: Catfish Row, a summer evening\n\nThe opera begins with a short introduction which segues into an evening in Catfish Row. Jasbo Brown entertains the community with his piano playing. Clara, a young mother, sings a lullaby to her baby (\" Summertime \") as the working men prepare for a game of craps (\"Roll them Bones\"). One of the players, Robbins, scorns his wife Serena's demands that he not play, retorting that on a Saturday night, a man has the right to play. Clara's husband, the fisherman Jake, tries his own lullaby (\"A Woman is a Sometime Thing\") with little effect. Little by little, other characters in the opera enter Catfish Row, among them Mingo, another fisherman, and Jim, a cotton-hauling stevedore who, tired of his job, decides to give it up and join Jake and the other fishermen. Porgy, a disabled beggar, enters on his goat cart to organize the game. Peter, an elderly \"honey man\" [honey vendor] returns, singing his vendor's call. Crown, a strong and brutal stevedore, storms in with his woman, Bess, and buys cheap whiskey and some \" happy dust \" off the local dope peddler, Sportin' Life. Bess is shunned by the women of the community, especially the pious Serena and the matriarchal cookshop owner Maria, but Porgy softly defends her. The game begins. One by one, the players get crapped out, leaving only Robbins and Crown, who has become extremely drunk. When Robbins wins, Crown attempts to prevent him from taking his winnings. A brawl ensues, which ends when Crown stabs Robbins with Jim's cotton hook, killing him. Crown runs, telling Bess to fend for herself but that he will be back for her when the heat dies down. Sportin' Life gives her a dose of happy dust and offers to take her with him when he goes to New York, but she rejects him. He flees, and Bess begins to pound on doors, but is rejected by all of the residents of Catfish Row, with the exception of Porgy, who lets her in.\n\nScene 2: Serena's Room, the following night\n\nThe mourners sing a spiritual to Robbins (\"Gone, Gone, Gone\"). To raise money for his burial, a saucer is placed on his chest for the mourners' donations (\"Overflow\"). Bess enters with Porgy and attempts to donate to the burial fund, but Serena rejects her money until Bess explains that she is now living with Porgy. A white detective enters and coldly tells Serena that she must bury her husband the next day, or his body will be given to medical students (for dissection ). He suddenly accuses Peter of Robbins's murder. Peter denies his guilt and says Crown was the murderer. The Detective orders Peter to be arrested as a material witness , whom he will force to testify against Crown. Serena laments her loss in \" My Man's Gone Now \". The undertaker enters. The saucer holds only fifteen dollars of the needed twenty-five, but he agrees to bury Robbins as long as Serena promises to pay him back. Bess, who has been sitting in silence slightly apart from the rest of those gathered, suddenly begins to sing a gospel song and the chorus joyfully join in, welcoming her into the community. (\"Oh, the Train is at de Station\")\n\n### Act 2\n\nScene 1: Catfish Row, a month later, in the morning\n\nJake and the other fishermen prepare for work (\"It take a long pull to get there\"). Clara asks Jake not to go because it is time for the annual storms, but he tells her that they desperately need the money. This causes Porgy to sing from his window about his new, happy-go-lucky outlook on life. (\" I Got Plenty o' Nuttin' \"). Sportin' Life waltzes around selling \"happy dust\", but soon incurs the wrath of Maria, who threatens him. (\"I hates yo' struttin' style\"). A fraudulent lawyer, Frazier, arrives and farcically divorces Bess from Crown. When he discovers Bess and Crown were not married, he raises his price from a dollar to a dollar and a half. Archdale, a white lawyer, enters and informs Porgy that Peter will soon be released. The bad omen of a buzzard flies over Catfish Row and Porgy demands that it leave now that he finally has found happiness. (\"Buzzard keep on flyin' over\".)\n\nAs the rest of Catfish Row prepares for the church picnic on nearby Kittiwah Island, Sportin' Life again offers to take Bess to New York with him; she refuses. He attempts to give her some \"happy dust\" despite her claims that she's given up drugs, but Porgy grabs his arm and scares him off. Sportin' Life leaves, reminding Bess as he goes that her men friends come and go, but he will be there all along. Bess and Porgy are now left alone, and express their love for each other (\" Bess, You Is My Woman Now \"). The chorus re-enters in high spirits as they prepare to leave for the picnic (\"Oh, I can't sit down\"). Bess is invited to the picnic by Maria, but she demurs as Porgy cannot come (due to his disability, he cannot get on the boat), but Maria insists. Bess leaves Porgy behind as they go off to the picnic. Porgy watches the boat leave (\"I got plenty o' nuttin\" reprise).\n\nScene 2: Kittiwah Island, that evening\n\nThe chorus enjoys themselves at the picnic (\"I ain't got no shame\"). Sportin' Life presents the chorus his cynical views on the Bible (\" It Ain't Necessarily So \"), causing Serena to chastise them (\"Shame on all you sinners!\"). Everyone gets ready to leave. As Bess, who has lagged behind, tries to follow them, Crown emerges from the bushes. He reminds her that Porgy is \"temporary\" and laughs off her claims that she has been living decently now. Bess wants to leave Crown forever and attempts to make him forget about her (\"Oh, what you want wid Bess?\") but Crown refuses to give her up. He grabs her and will not let her go to the boat, which leaves without her, and then forcefully kisses her. He laughs at his conquest as her resistance begins to fail, and commands her to get into the woods, where his intentions are only too clear.\n\nScene 3: Catfish Row, a week later, just before dawn\n\nA week later, Jake leaves to go fishing with his crew, one of whom observes that it looks as if a storm is coming in. Peter, still unsure of his crime, returns from prison. Meanwhile, Bess is lying in Porgy's room delirious with fever, which she has had ever since returning from Kittiwah Island. Serena prays to remove Bess's affliction (\"Oh, Doctor Jesus\"), and promises Porgy that Bess will be well by five o'clock. As the day passes, a strawberry woman, Peter (the Honey Man) and a crab man each pass by with their wares (\"Vendors' Trio\"). As the clock chimes five, Bess recovers from her fever. Porgy tells Bess that he knows she has been with Crown, and she admits that Crown has promised to return for her. Porgy tells her she is free to go if she wants to, and she tells him that although she wants to stay (\"I Wants to Stay Here\"), she is afraid of Crown's hold on her. Porgy asks her what would happen if there was no Crown, and Bess tells Porgy she loves him and begs him to protect her. Porgy promises that she will never have to be afraid again (\" I Loves You, Porgy \").\n\nClara watches the water, fearful for Jake. Maria tries to allay her fears, but suddenly the hurricane bell begins to ring.\n\nScene 4: Serena's Room, dawn of the next day\n\nThe residents of Catfish Row are all gathered in Serena's room for shelter from the hurricane. They drown out the sound of the storm with prayers and hymns (\"Oh, Doctor Jesus\") while Sportin' Life mocks their assumption that the storm is a signal of Judgment Day . Clara desperately sings her lullaby (\"Summertime\" [reprise]). A knock is heard at the door, and the chorus believes it to be Death (\"Oh there's somebody knocking at the door\"). Crown enters dramatically, having swum from Kittiwah Island, seeking Bess. He shows no fear of God, claiming that after the long struggle from Kittiwah, God and he are friends. The chorus tries to drown out his blaspheming with more prayer, and he taunts them by singing a vulgar song (\"A red-headed woman\"). Suddenly, Clara sees Jake's boat float past the window, upside-down, and she runs out to try to save him, handing her baby to Bess. Bess asks that one of the men go out with her, and Crown taunts Porgy, who cannot go. Crown goes himself, yelling out as he leaves \"Alright, Big Friend! We're on for another Bout!\" The chorus continue to pray as the storm rises.\n\n### Act 3\n\nScene 1: Catfish Row, the next night\n\nA group of women mourn Clara, Jake, and all of those who have been killed in the storm (\"Clara, Clara, don't you be downhearted\"). When they begin to mourn for Crown as well, Sportin' Life laughs at them and is told off by Maria. He insinuates that Crown may not be dead, and observes that when a woman has a man, maybe she's got him for keeps, but if she has two men, then it's highly likely she'll end up with none. Bess is heard singing Clara's lullaby to her baby, whom she is now taking care of. (\"Summertime\" [reprise]). Once Catfish Row is dark, Crown stealthily enters to claim Bess, but is confronted by Porgy. A fight ensues that ends when Porgy kills Crown. Porgy exclaims to Bess, \"You've got a man now. You've got Porgy!\"\n\nScene 2: Catfish Row, the next afternoon\n\nThe detective enters and talks with Serena and her friends about the murders of Crown and Robbins. They deny knowledge of Crown's murder, frustrating the detective. Needing a witness for the coroner's inquest, he next questions an apprehensive Porgy. Once Porgy admits to knowing Crown, he is ordered to come and identify Crown's body. Sportin' Life tells Porgy that corpses bleed in the presence of their murderers, and the detective will use this to hang Porgy. Porgy refuses to identify the body, but is dragged off anyway. Bess is distraught, and Sportin' Life puts his plan into action. He tells her that Porgy will be locked up for a long time, and points out that he is the only one still here. He offers her happy dust, and though she refuses, he forces it on her. After she takes a whiff, he paints a seductive picture of her life with him in New York (\"There's a boat dat's leavin' soon for New York\"). She regains her strength and rushes inside, slamming the door on his face, but he leaves a packet of happy dust on her doorstep, and settles down to wait.\n\nScene 3: Catfish Row, a week later\n\nOn a beautiful morning, Porgy is released from jail, where he has been arrested for contempt of court after refusing to look at Crown's body. He returns to Catfish Row much richer after playing craps with his cellmates. He gives gifts to the residents, and pulls out a beautiful red dress for Bess. He does not understand why everyone seems so uneasy at his return. He sees Clara's baby is now with Serena and realizes something is wrong. He asks where Bess is. Maria and Serena tell him that Bess has run off with Sportin' Life to New York (\"Oh Bess, Oh Where's my Bess?\"). Porgy calls for his goat cart, and resolves to leave Catfish Row to find her. He prays for strength, and begins his journey. (\"Oh, Lawd, I'm on my way\")",

The musical has been a popular choice for amateur theatre productions because of its small cast and simple staging.",
        "synopsis": "### Original\n\nCharlie Brown and Linus are together, as his friends give their various opinions of him (\"Opening\"). Today everyone is calling him a \"good man\". They state he could be king. Lucy, however says he could be king if he wasn't so wishy-washy (\"You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown\"). Lucy expresses her deep infatuation with Schroeder and asks him what he thinks of the idea of marriage. Schroeder is aware of her feelings, but remains aloof as he plays his piano. Lucy then exclaims: \"My Aunt Marion was right. Never try to discuss marriage with a musician\" (\"Schroeder\").\n\nSchroeder is walking around in the sun, happy with all the peace and quiet. However, that is soon interrupted by Lucy screaming for a ball. Snoopy is lying on top of his doghouse , relaxing vacantly and peacefully. He daydreams that all the children are adoring him, and saying he's \u201cthe best dog in the world\u201d. Birds start to poke his stomach, and then he begins to daydream about being a wild jungle beast. In a few minutes, however, he is back to his peaceful state (\"Snoopy\").\n\nLinus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb. Lucy and Patty show up and mock him for this habit. Lucy tries to pull away the blanket, but fails. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to come running back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus decides to relax with his blanket until he can outgrow it (\"My Blanket and Me\"). Charlie Brown appears, trying to get his unusually stubborn kite to soar in the air. Eventually, he succeeds in doing this, and he enjoys a few minutes of triumph before the kite plummets to the ground (\"The Kite\").\n\nAfter this trauma, Charlie Brown tries to find the right way to give The Little Red-Headed Girl her Valentine's Day card, but he ends up saying \"Merry Christmas\", making a fool out of himself. He finds Patty handing out valentines, and she drops a valentine with the initials C.B. Charlie Brown gives it back to Patty, but soon learns it was Craig Bowerman's valentine. He goes to see Lucy, who is at her psychiatrist booth. He tells her all the things he thinks of himself. Lucy then clears it up by saying that Charlie Brown is unique the way he is, then asks for the five cent price (\"The Doctor Is In\").\n\nLater, Lucy comes up to Schroeder again and talks about if they got married, and they were so poor that Schroeder had to sell his piano for saucepans, and, again, Schroeder cannot stand it. At noon, Linus, Lucy, Schroeder, and Charlie Brown are working on their Peter Rabbit book reports, each in his or her own way. Lucy is simply babbling to fit the 100-word requirement, Schroeder is doing a \"comparison\" between the book and Robin Hood , Linus is doing an overcomplicated psychological analysis, and Charlie Brown hasn't even started out of worry (\"The Book Report\").\n\nSnoopy, in his World War I flying ace uniform, climbs atop his doghouse. He goes through a scene, with him being a pilot searching for the Red Baron . In his imagination, he is defeated by the Red Baron and returns to the aerodrome in France (\"The Red Baron\"). Meanwhile, Charlie Brown returns, and, with his friends, plays the Little League Baseball Championship. After some mishaps, the team finally manages to make some progress. Charlie Brown steps up to the plate, and despite his valiant efforts, strikes out and loses the game. We learn that this was a flashback , and Charlie Brown expresses his deep sorrow to his pen pal (\"T-E-A-M (The Baseball Game)\").\n\nLater on, Linus and Lucy arrive home. Linus starts to watch TV, but Lucy tells him to switch channels. Lucy tells Linus that what she intends to do when she grows up, she will become a queen. Linus denies, and Lucy decides to cultivate her life for her \"natural beauty\" (\"Queen Lucy\"). The next day, at lunchtime, Charlie Brown talks about his bad days. Then he notices the Little Red-Haired Girl approaching and puts a paper bag over his head. It turns out it is Lucy and Patty, chatting together.\n\nAt Schroeder's Glee Club , Patty is the only one to arrive early. When everyone comes, it's chaos. Unfortunately, a fight ensues between Lucy and Linus over a pencil. Lucy threatens to tell Patty that Linus called her an enigma. The fight spreads, and Charlie Brown decides to leave with his angry friends, leaving Schroeder and Snoopy the only ones singing (\"Glee Club Rehearsal\"). Later, Charlie Brown comes across Lucy teaching Linus about nature the way she views it, with \"facts\" such as bugs pulling the grass to make it grow or snow coming out of the ground in winter . Charlie Brown tries to correct her, but she retaliates with a false explanation, and Charlie Brown bangs his head against a tree in frustration (\" Little Known Facts \").\n\nThe next morning, Snoopy is puzzled why he has his supper in the red dish, and the water in the blue dish. Meanwhile, Linus and Schroeder are walking to school. Schroeder asks if Linus filled out the form that Ms. Othmar gave them. Linus puts down \u201c Dr. Seuss \u201c. Snoopy talks about how he hates cats, but he is also scared of them (\"Peanuts Potpourri\").  That evening, Snoopy complains that he hasn't been fed yet, and begins to overly complicate and dramatize the matter until Charlie Brown shows up with his dinner. Snoopy bursts into song about his craving for supper until Charlie Brown firmly tells him to eat his meal (\"Suppertime\").\n\nThat night, everyone is looking at the stars in wonder. Charlie Brown soon discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that \"there are teeth-marks all over it . . . she nibbles her pencil . . . she's HUMAN! \" With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well (\"Happiness\"). Right then, he realizes being a \"good man\" means trying your best and making the most of the things you've been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him then tells him, \"You're a good man, Charlie Brown.\"\n\n### Revised\n\nCharlie Brown's friends express their various opinions of him (\"Opening\"). As Charlie Brown heads to school, he takes in his friends referring to him as a \"good man\" and ponders what this really means (\"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\"). Alone one day, during lunch, Charlie Brown talks about his bad days. Then he notices the Little Red-Haired Girl and decides to go sit with her. However, he cannot find the courage to do so, and puts a paper bag over his head. Lucy and Sally walk by and draw a dress on the paper bag. Charlie Brown eventually takes it off and bemoans his lack of confidence (\"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\" (reprise)). Lucy expresses her deep infatuation with Schroeder and asks him what he thinks of the idea of marriage. Schroeder is aware of her feelings, but remains aloof as he plays his piano. Lucy then exclaims: \"My Aunt Marion was right. Never try to discuss marriage with a musician\" (\"Schroeder\"). Sally is sad because her jump rope tangled up.\n\nSnoopy lies on top of his doghouse , relaxing vacantly and peacefully. He begins to daydream about being a wild jungle beast. In a few minutes, however, he is back to his peaceful state (\"Snoopy\"). Linus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb . Lucy and Sally show up and mock him for this habit. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to come running back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus daydreams of a blanket fantasy where everyone can relax with their blankets (\"My Blanket and Me\"). Lucy later tells him that she would someday like to be a queen (\"Queen Lucy\"). However, Linus tells her that she can't and she threatens to punch him. Sally gets a C for her pathetic coat-hanger sculpture.\n\nCharlie Brown tries to fly his kite and experiences a brief few minutes of triumph before it is eaten by the notorious Kite-Eating Tree (\"The Kite\"). Later, Charlie Brown tries to find the right way to give Lucy a Valentine's Day card, but he ends up saying \"Merry Christmas\", making a fool out of himself. He later learns that no one sent him a card, whereas everyone else, including Snoopy, got several. He goes to see Lucy, who is at her psychiatrist booth. He tells her all the things he thinks of himself. Lucy then clears it up by saying that Charlie Brown is unique the way he is, then asks for the five cent price (\"The Doctor Is In\"). Schroeder spreads the word of Beethoven 's birthday and pulling together a celebration (\"Beethoven Day\").\n\nSally wakes up Snoopy to go rabbit chasing, and they go into strange places, like the Sahara. Linus, Lucy, Schroeder, and Charlie Brown work on their Peter Rabbit book reports, each in their own way: Lucy is simply babbling to fit the 100-word requirement, Schroeder is doing a \"comparison\" between the book and Robin Hood , Linus is doing an overcomplicated psychological analysis, and Charlie Brown hasn't even started out of worry, while Sally and Snoopy continue to chase rabbits (\"The Book Report\").\n\nSnoopy, in his World War I flying ace uniform climbs atop his doghouse. He goes through a scene, with him being a pilot searching for the Red Baron . In his imagination, he is defeated by the Red Baron and returns to the aerodrome in France (\"The Red Baron\").\n\nSally, upset about a D her teacher gave her on her homework assignment, comes up with her new \"philosophy: \"Oh, yeah? That's what you think!\" To Schroeder's bewilderment, she comes up with various new \"philosophies\", ignoring Schroeder's attempts to explain how philosophies actually work (\"My New Philosophy\"). Charlie Brown describes to his pen pal the events of a recent baseball game, where after various mishaps they nearly won the game, only for him to strike out and lose (\"T-E-A-M (The Baseball Game)\"). After Schroeder tells her she is a very crabby person, Lucy takes a crabbiness survey of all her friends to determine her crabbiness: Charlie Brown gives a waffling answer, while Sally is more definitive. Upon asking Linus, he refuses to answer until she promises not to punch him; when he gives her a score of ninety-five, though, she punches him anyway. After tallying the score, she realizes that she, in reality, is really very crabby and becomes depressed. Linus cheers her up by reminding her she has a little brother who loves her, remarking as she sobs in his shoulder, \"Every now and then I say the right thing!\"\n\nThe gang gathers for Schroeder's Glee Club and sing \" Home on the Range \". Unfortunately, a fight ensues between Lucy and Linus over a pencil, eventually leading to everyone except Schroeder and Snoopy becoming fed up and leaving (\"Glee Club Rehearsal\"). Charlie Brown comes across Lucy teaching Linus about nature the way she views it, with \"facts\" such as bugs pulling the grass to make it grow or snow growing out of the ground in winter . Charlie Brown tries to correct her, but she retaliates with a false explanation, and Charlie Brown bangs his head against a tree in frustration (\" Little Known Facts \"). Snoopy complains that he hasn't been fed yet, and begins to overly complicate and dramatize the matter until Charlie Brown shows up with his dinner. Snoopy bursts into song about his craving for supper until Charlie Brown firmly tells him to eat his meal (\"Suppertime\").\n\nCharlie Brown discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that \"there are teeth-marks all over it...she nibbles her pencil... she's HUMAN! \" With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone expresses what makes them happy as well (\"Happiness\"). Lucy approaches Charlie Brown and firmly shakes his hand, telling him, \"You're a good man, Charlie Brown.\"\n\nA medley of \"Happiness\" and \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown\" is performed as the cast comes out for a final curtain call.",

        "description": "Elf is a musical based on the 2003 motion picture , with a score by Matthew Sklar and Chad Beguelin . The book is adapted by Bob Martin and Thomas Meehan from the film.\n\nThe musical premiered on Broadway in the Christmas season of 2010 and was revived in 2012 and 2024. It played in London's West End in 2015, 2022, 2023, and 2025, and it has toured extensively in English-speaking countries, often during the Christmas holiday season.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nSanta Claus, annoyed that his football game has been recorded over, opens a large pop-up book to read a story. Buddy is the happiest and tallest elf by far (\"Christmastown\"). It turns out that Buddy is human. Santa explains that Buddy's mother had died, and, as an orphan, he had crawled into Santa's toy sack; arriving at the North Pole, he was raised as an elf. Santa encourages Buddy to go to New York City to find his birth father, Walter Hobbs, who is on the naughty list because he doesn't believe in Santa. Nevertheless, Buddy hopes that Walter will be the \"World's Greatest Dad\".\n\nWalter works long hours as a book publisher in the Empire State Building . Too busy to shop for gifts with his son, Michael, and wife, Emily, he laments that Christmas gets \"In the Way\". Dressed in his elf clothes, Buddy finds Walter's office, where he is mistaken for a singing telegram entertainer, but he sings that Walter is his father. Walter does not believe him and has building security take Buddy to the nearby Macy's Department Store North Pole village. The employees there love Buddy's happy Christmas spirit (\"Sparklejollytwinklejingley\"). Buddy quickly falls for Jovie, a practical-minded Macy's elf, and persuades her to go on a date with him. The next day, however, Buddy sees Macy's Santa and declares that he is not the real Santa, causing a fracas. The police bring him to the residence of the Hobbs family.\n\nThere, Michael and Emily are struggling to build a science project. Buddy helps them to complete the project, in exchange for Michael and Emily sending a letter to Santa asking for quality time with Walter (\"I'll Believe in You\"). Walter gets home, and they convince him to let Buddy sleep there for the night. In the morning, they receive the results of a DNA test that Emily arranged; it proves that Buddy is Walter's son (\"In the Way\" (reprise)). Reluctantly, he takes Buddy to his office, because Emily has a meeting. Buddy, wearing a new suit like his dad's, hopes to be \"Just Like Him\". Mr. Greenway, Walter's boss, tells Walter that if he does not publish a hit children's book by Christmas Eve, he will be fired; Walter, under pressure, grows even more frustrated by Buddy's distracting exuberance.\n\nBuddy takes Jovie on a date, and the two have romantic chemistry. He plans to fulfill her Christmas wish by taking her to dinner at Tavern on the Green . Jovie enjoys Buddy's enthusiasm as he encourages her to spread Christmas Cheer by loudly singing \"A Christmas Song\". Buddy is eager to tell Walter that he is in love and decides to cheer up his dad by making it snow in his office, so he shreds up some paper that turns out to be the manuscript of the children's book that Walter is feverishly working on.  Walter angrily tosses Buddy out of the office, asking him never to return. Buddy is despondent (\"World Greatest Dad\" (reprise)).\n\n### Act 2\n\nSanta recounts that Buddy left a farewell message for the Hobbs family. On Christmas Eve, hungry and alone on the streets of New York, Buddy finds a Chinese restaurant, where he meets unhappy, out-of-a-job fake Santas complaining that \"Nobody Cares About Santa\". Buddy is two hours late for his date with Jovie, who is waiting angrily in front of Tavern on the Green. She vows: \"Never Fall in Love (With an Elf)\". When Buddy shows up, he gives her a snow globe that Santa had given him when he departed from the North Pole, but she is too disappointed and departs.\n\nEmily and Michael find Buddy's letter and wish to retrieve him. Out of their apartment window, they see Santa's sleigh and realize that they have been wrong: \"There Is a Santa Claus\". They go to the Empire State Building, where Buddy also arrives, to find Walter sweating as he works to pitch a book idea to his boss. Buddy suggests \"The Story of Buddy the Elf\". Mr. Greenway loves the idea but says the book should be about a horse, rather than an elf. He demands that Walter work through Christmas to produce the book. However, Mr. Greenway overplays his hand by rudely criticizing Walter's sons, and Walter quits his job. Michael relates that he and his mother saw Santa's sleigh land. This alarms Buddy, as he knows this means that the sleigh must have lost power from a lack of Christmas spirit in New York City. The Hobbs family rushes to Central Park (\"Nobody Cares About Santa\" (reprise)).\n\nBuddy is struck by a plan. He sees a news crew covering a purported UFO event. Grabbing the reporter's microphone, he encourages all New Yorkers to spread the Christmas spirit to repower the sleigh and speed Santa on his way. Jovie appears, and she starts to sing \"A Christmas Song\" (reprise). Other New Yorkers begin to sing, and their collective Christmas cheer works. Santa invites Buddy to come home with him to the North Pole, but at last, Buddy feels that he has a place in New York, where he can continue making everyone happy.\n\nOn Christmas Day at his home, Santa closes the big book and hears a knock on his door. There he finds Buddy, Jovie, their new baby, Buddy Jr., and the rest of the Hobbs family arriving to celebrate Christmas with him. This becomes their annual tradition.\n\n### Differences from the film\n\nInstead of Santa Claus, the film is narrated by Papa Elf, who does not appear in the musical. Other minor changes from the movie to the musical include Santa Claus using an iPhone instead of a list of names while delivering gifts, Buddy and Jovie's child being changed from a girl to a boy, the department store scenes taking place at Macy's instead of Gimbels , and Buddy being dropped off at the Hobbs house instead of being bailed out of jail by Walter. The musical also adds a subplot about Michael and Emily Hobbs' disbelief in Santa Claus. And instead of having an elf named Ming Ming, they changed the name to Charlie and had a girl elf named Shwanda.\n\nSeveral scenes from the film are absent, including Buddy's visit to the mail room of the Empire State Building, and Buddy rescuing Michael from school bullies in a Central Park snowball fight. The character of Miles Finch is cut in the musical. In the musical, Walter's staff writers happen upon the only copy of an unpublished manuscript for a Christmas story by deceased famous author Chris Smith. Buddy shreds the document, not understanding its significance. This is when Walter angrily says he wishes Buddy wasn't his son, instead of in the aftermath of the Miles Finch scene.\n\nThe film and musical strongly deviate in the character of Walter. In the film, Walter is portrayed as greedy, obsessed with his work, and deliberately neglectful of his family duties. In the musical, he is shown as merely bumbling, forgetful, and overworked. Santa Claus explains in the film that Walter is on his \"naughty\" list because of his greed and general meanness, whereas in the musical it is because he doesn't believe in Santa. In the musical, after Buddy pitches the idea of making the book about how he came to the North Pole (leading into the song, \"The Story of Buddy the Elf\"), Mr. Greenway loves the story, but Walter quits after Mr. Greenway insults his sons; in the film Walter chooses to go with Michael to bring Buddy back home, instead of pitching anything to Mr. Greenway, which leads to his firing.",

        "description": "A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant is a satirical musical about Scientology and L. Ron Hubbard , written by Kyle Jarrow from a concept by Alex Timbers , the show's original director.  Jarrow based the story of the one-act, one-hour musical on Hubbard's writings and Church of Scientology literature.  The musical follows the life of Hubbard as he develops Dianetics and then Scientology. Though the musical pokes fun at Hubbard's science fiction writing and personal beliefs, it has been called a \"deadpan presentation\" of his life story. Topics explored in the piece include Dianetics, the E-meter , Thetans , and the story of Xenu . The show was originally presented in 2003 in New York City by Les Freres Corbusier , an experimental theater troupe, enjoying sold-out Off-Off-Broadway and Off-Broadway productions.  Later productions have included Los Angeles , New York, Boston , Atlanta , Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.\n\nEarly in the production of the musical, the president of the Church of Scientology in New York sent a letter to the producer pointing out the Church's history of litigation .  This led Timbers and Jarrow to insert the word Unauthorized into the title, upon the advice of legal counsel.  During the Los Angeles production, representatives of the Church of Scientology visited the production staff in the midst of rehearsals and handed out documentation of successful litigation against critics of Scientology . Parents of some of the Los Angeles cast members also received phone calls from Scientologists in the entertainment industry, asking them not to allow their children to perform in the musical.\n\nA Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant has been well received. The 2003 New York production received an Obie Award , and director Alex Timbers received a Garland Award for the 2004 Los Angeles production.  The musical also received positive reviews in the press. The New York Times characterized it as a \" cult-hit \", and The Village Voice , the Los Angeles Times and The Guardian all gave it favorable reviews. Variety and The Boston Globe had kind words for the updated 2006 edition.  A 2004 cast recording released by Sh-K-Boom Records received four out of five stars from Allmusic and plaudits from The Los Angeles Daily News .",

When Dennis learns that part of the plan involves demolishing The Bourbon Room, he believes the club can generate more money by having rock star Stacee Jaxx and his band Arsenal, who recently announced their break-up, perform their last show at the Bourbon (\" Too Much Time on My Hands \"). He calls Stacee and convinces him to play the band's last show in the club where he had begun. As Drew struggles to write new lyrics, Sherrie urges him to go after his dreams (\" I Wanna Rock \"). Regina begins protesting Hertz and Franz's redevelopment plans (\" We're Not Gonna Take It \").\n\nLater, after arguing with her parents during a phone call, Sherrie begins to discover feelings for Drew, who supports her dream. Also, Drew, auditioning to open for Arsenal, finds the lyrics he has been searching for and realizes that they have come from his feelings for Sherrie (\" More Than Words /Heaven/To Be with You\"). After obtaining the opening slot for Arsenal, Drew invites Sherrie to have a picnic in the hills overlooking Los Angeles (\" Waiting For a Girl Like You \"). There, he suggests that the two are merely friends to calm their nerves, disappointing both of them and ruining the date.\n\nStacee Jaxx arrives at the Bourbon and gives an interview about his life (\" Wanted Dead or Alive \"). Sherrie is immediately smitten with him, and believing she means nothing to Drew, has sex with Stacee in the men's room (\"I Want to Know What Love Is\"). While Stacee and Sherrie are copulating, Drew opens for Stacee and Arsenal, not knowing a record producer is in the audience. After their tryst, Stacee tells Dennis to dismiss Sherrie before the concert begins. His guitarist realizes what Stacee did and knocks him out. A record producer, Ja'Keith Gill, in the club was impressed with Drew's performance and suggests he take over for Stacee. He then offers Drew a contract, which he accepts. Sherrie seeks comfort from Drew after she is fired, but having seen her go into the men's room with Stacee, he dismisses her (\" Cum on Feel the Noize \"). In the midst of these events, Regina continues her protest (\" We're Not Gonna Take It [Reprise]\").\n\nAn upset and unemployed Sherrie meets Justice Charlier, the owner of the nearby Venus Club, which Justice prefers to call a \"gentleman's club.\" She relates to Sherrie's story, saying that many of the small-town girls hoping to hit it big in LA end up making a living as strippers. Grudgingly, Sherrie accepts Justice's offer to work in her club (\" Harden My Heart /Shadows of the Night\"). As the act closes, everyone is alone\u00a0\u2013 Drew, as a soon-to-be rock star; Sherrie, fending for herself as an exotic dancer; Regina protesting the redevelopment; and Dennis, trying to save his club (\" Here I Go Again \").\n\n### Act II\n\nHertz and Franz begin demolition on the Sunset Strip, alienating them from each other as Franz falls for Regina and sees \"the error of their ways.\" Dennis and Lonny join the fight with little success (\" The Final Countdown \"). Drew's rocker image is upsetting Ja'Keith, and Sherrie is learning how things work at the Venus Club (\" Any Way You Want It / I Wanna Rock [Reprise]\"). When they meet on the street, Sherrie is embarrassed about her job and Drew is upset that his record company is attempting to reshape him into part of a hip-hop boy band , \"Street Boyz,\" as Joshy J. They argue and Sherrie admits that she was crazy about Drew, but failed to make a move because he said they were friends. They part ways more troubled by these new revelations (\" High Enough \").\n\nA drunken Stacee arrives at the Venus Club and is pleased to see Sherrie. After being forced to give him a lap-dance, she beats him up while dancing (\" I Hate Myself for Loving You / Heat of the Moment \"). Drew arrives to admit his feelings to her, but becomes angry when he sees the two in a suggestive position and storms off. Justice later tells Drew that as soon as he left, Sherrie punched Stacee in the jaw.\n\nRegina continues her protest against the destruction of the Strip, but it yields no success. She convinces Franz to stand up to his father if he does not believe in his father's vision. Franz admits that he has his own dream: to open a confectioner 's store in Germany . He rebels against his father and admits his love for Regina (\" Hit Me with Your Best Shot \"). Meanwhile, Dennis and Lonny, upset at the loss of The Bourbon Room, admit that they have feelings for each other (\" Can't Fight This Feeling \").\n\nSherrie decides to leave the Venus Club after the scene with Drew, and Justice tells her that she had a similar experience with her first love. Everyone is in turmoil as they attempt to move on with their lives (\" Every Rose Has Its Thorn \"). Franz leaves for Germany and Hertz begins to regret the hurtful way he treated his son (\" Keep on Loving You \"). Regina arrives and explains to Hertz that Franz does not hate him; he simply wants his father to support his dream. Hertz decides to return the deed to the Bourbon Room to Dennis and invest in Franz's confectionery store.\n\nDrew, now a pizza delivery boy, realizes none of his dreams have come true\u2014he still is not a rock star, and Sherrie is leaving on a midnight train. Lonny arrives and breaks the fourth wall by explaining to Drew that his life is so miserable because they are all characters in a musical and that it was their book writer who made it so. He also reveals to Drew that he serves as the show's \"dramatic conjurer\" and that if Drew wants a happy ending, it is up to him to \"get the girl.\" After hearing this, Drew realizes that he does not need fame to make him happy, only Sherrie (\" Oh Sherrie \"). He reaches her at the train station in time, where they realize that their love has survived all their trials and reconcile (\" The Search Is Over \").\n\nIn the epilogue, The Bourbon Room is spared from demolition and Stacee Jaxx, now a washed-up has-been who has been charged with statutory rape , flees to Uruguay (\" Renegade \"). Franz opens his confectionery store in Germany and has a long-distance relationship with Regina, who becomes the new mayor of West Hollywood . Dennis passes away, leaving the Bourbon Room to Lonny, and Sherrie and Drew move to Glendale and start a family. Lonny notes that on The Strip, sometimes the dreams with which you enter are not always the dreams with which you leave, but they still rock (\" Don't Stop Believin' \").",

        "description": "Two's Company is a musical revue with principal sketches by Charles Sherman and Peter DeVries , principal lyrics by Ogden Nash and Sammy Cahn , and principal music by Vernon Duke .\n\nThe evening consisted of a series of show business -themed comedy sketches and song-and-dance routines tailored for the talents of its centerpiece, Bette Davis , who accepted the challenge of an eight-shows-a-week schedule when good film roles failed to follow her triumph in All About Eve .\n\nThe out-of-town tryout opened at the Shubert Theatre in Detroit on October 19, 1952. In the middle of the third chorus of her first song, an overworked Davis collapsed. Revived by her then-husband Gary Merrill , she walked to the apron of the stage and with a smile commented to the audience, \"Well, you can't say I didn't fall for you!,\" winning over both them and the critics, whose reviews were kind.\n\nFrom there the show moved to Pittsburgh , where it was met with less enthusiasm, and the creative team began reshaping it on a nightly basis. By the time it reached Boston it was in serious trouble, and noted play doctor and Davis friend John Murray Anderson was called in for consultation. Roles were recast, sketches were eliminated and new ones added, and musical sequences were rearranged. Several songs were contributed by others, including Sheldon Harnick , and Horton Foote was among those who wrote additional sketch material.\n\nAmong the leading lady's characterizations were Tallulah Bankhead , Jeanne Eagels , an actress involved with an Italian director, a hillbilly singer on a television variety show, and a performer in parodies of plays by No\u00ebl Coward and Arthur Miller .\n\nWith Davis bedridden due to exhaustion, the Broadway opening, scheduled for December 4, was postponed. The revue, directed by Jules Dassin and choreographed by Jerome Robbins , finally opened on December 15, 1952 at the Alvin Theatre , where it ran for 90 performances. In addition to Davis, the cast included David Burns , Nora Kaye , George S. Irving , Maria Karnilova , Tina Louise , Ellen Hanley , Stanley Prager , and Hiram Sherman , who won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. Additionally, Florence Baum (later Florence Brooks, Dunay, then Weisgal) danced in the show. She would later go on to marry EGOT winner Mel Brooks, and had three children with him.\n\nDespite mostly unfavorable notices, the show played to sold-out houses. Davis continued to suffer from fatigue, but doctors could find no physical cause. When a wisdom tooth became inflamed, it was discovered she was suffering from osteomyelitis of the jaw, which required immediate surgery . With no hope of Davis returning in the near future, the producers opted to close the show, but not before Bette Davis's understudy Lenore Korman took over the role. But the production ended up losing $320,000 of the investment. There is an undocumented rumor that Bette Davis wanted no part of this musical and she had from the very beginning found a woman in the singing ensemble who had a most fabulous voice, to eventually take over the role after Davis feigned all her illness. The star's rehabilitation ultimately kept her unemployed for the next three years. That also was an unverified ruse that held that Davis simply took a break.\n\nThe original cast recording is available on compact disc on the Sepia label.  The compact disc release includes six bonus tracks not on the original cast LP record.",

The story centers on a busload of lonely American widows hoping to catch husbands while touring Israel and is set against the backdrop of the country's struggle for recognition as an independent nation. It was Herman's first Broadway book musical following a succession of off-Broadway revues .",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nThe calm of a morning street scene in modern Jerusalem is shattered when a police officer orders a Yemenite boy to remove his flock of sheep to a side street. Phil Arkin, an American visiting his married daughter, defends the boy, and in the ensuing fracas he meets Ruth Stein, a tourist travelling with a group of widows from the United States. She is impressed with Phil's command of Hebrew as he explains the meaning of the word \" Shalom \".\n\nThey keep running into each other and together they celebrate Israel's Independence Day (\"Independence Day Hora\"). Their friendship begins to deepen and Phil's conscience starts troubling him. Although he has been separated from his wife for many years, he does not think it right to continue seeing Ruth since he is still married. Phil's daughter, Barbara, however, likes Ruth and invites her to go with them to her farm in the Negev . After some hesitation, Ruth accepts.\n\nOn the farm - called a Moshav - Phil tries to talk Barbara and her husband David into going back to Baltimore with him. But the young man vows his devotion to his country and is joined in its praise by his neighbors, including his cynical friend Adi, who claims he would rather live in the city (\"Milk and Honey\").\n\nPhil, who is falling in love with Ruth, asks her to stay at Barbara's a little longer. In fact, he is even thinking of building a house of his own there that he would like her to share (\"There's No Reason in the World\").\n\nMeanwhile, the group of touring widows comes to visit. When they eye the virile young farmers, the ladies, led by Clara Weiss, reveal their hopes of finding suitable husbands. Though their dreams are quickly dashed when all the men turn out to be married, Clara is still optimistic (\"Chin Up, Ladies\").\n\nLater, Phil tells Ruth that he has bought a lot on which to build a home, and she gives him her approval (\"That Was Yesterday\"). But Barbara is shocked at the news, and urges her father to tell Ruth that he is married. Reluctantly he does, but he also tells her why she must remain (\"Let's Not Waste a Moment\"). At a wedding ceremony that they attend, Phil and Ruth, envious of the younger people, express their deep love for each other and, forgetting the consequences for the moment, go off together (\"The Wedding\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nPhil energetically feels the spirit of the new land and goes out to work the fields with the other farmers (\"Like A Young Man\"). Barbara, however, brings news that Ruth, realizing the consequences of living with a married man, has run off to Tel Aviv, and Phil goes off to bring her back. When they are alone, David, convinced that Barbara really longs to go back to the United States, asserts that he would go anywhere to be with her (\"I Will Follow You\").\n\nIn Tel Aviv , Phil finds Clara at the Cafe Hotok, but she refuses to tell him where Ruth is. When he leaves, Clara accidentally meets Sol Horowitz, a widower from Jerusalem, and they promptly show mutual interest. Alone, she seeks her late husband's permission to remarry if Sol proposes (\"Hymn to Hymie\").\n\nBack at the moshav, Phil, after much inner conflict, realizes that it would be wrong to live with Ruth. Although she comes back to him, he tells her that she must leave (\"As Simple as That\").\n\nAt Lydda Airport , the touring widows are preparing to board the plane home. Phil and Ruth have their final, brief moment together during which he promises to fly to Paris, where his wife lives, and plead for a divorce. Ruth boards the plane with the hope that somehow Phil will succeed and she will be able to come back to him (\"Finale\").",

Erik was born and raised in the catacombs under the Paris Opera House and needs beautiful music \u2013 he cannot exist without it. Complications arise when G\u00e9rard Carri\u00e8re, the company manager, loses his position as head of the Opera house and therefore cannot protect Erik any longer. Furthermore, Carlotta, the new diva and wife of the new owner of the Opera, has such a terrible voice that the Phantom is in torment. His salvation must eventually come through Christine, whose voice is so beautiful that he falls in love with her. He accepts Christine as his pupil, training her for the opera, but forbids her to see his face. Erik's rival for Christine's affection is Count Philippe de Chandon, whose influence helps Christine get a minor job with the Paris Opera, but it is Erik's training that helps her earn a place as a member of the company. When Carlotta's jealous machinations ruin Christine's debut, Erik spirits Christine to his underground lair and later takes a terrible revenge by electrocuting Carlotta.\n\nCarri\u00e8re finds Christine and reveals an amazing secret: he is actually Erik's father. Emboldened by this revelation, Christine begs Erik to let her see his face, since his mother was able to look at him and smile. Reluctantly, he removes his mask (although the audience never sees his face), but Christine doesn't have the same fortitude and recoils in horror, causing Erik to go on a destructive rampage. Carri\u00e8re helps the guilt-stricken Christine to escape, and later he returns to tell Erik the truth about their relationship. However, Erik has known all along that Carri\u00e8re is his father and has only waited for Carri\u00e8re to corroborate the fact. Erik fears that he will be captured and treated like a circus freak because of his horrendous face, but Carri\u00e8re promises Erik that he will never be put on display. The police surround him, and Erik makes a failed attempt to swing to safety on a rope. With Erik dangling helplessly, the chief of police tells his men not to shoot because they \"can take him alive!\". Erik shouts out to his father for help. Carri\u00e8re understands; he grabs a policeman's gun and aims at his son. Reluctantly, he fires, and the Phantom falls. Fatally wounded, Erik allows Christine to remove his mask. She now smiles and tells him \"You are music, beautiful music, and you are light to me \u2026 you are life to me,\" and places the mask on him again as he dies.",

Henry wins the final, and after a brief hiccup involving an out-of-date passport, he is on a Portuguese beach with his brothers (\u2018FEEL LIKE THIS\u2019). But of course, the story must go on, and Henry knows all too well what happens next...\n\nSuddenly, Fran and Andrew arrive at a Portuguese hospital, frazzled and scared, and they are told that Henry hit his head on a bank of sand whilst diving into the sea, damaging the fourth vertebra in his neck. Henry is paralysed from the top of his shoulders down. In the shock of the news, Fran dissociates and disappears into her memories (\u2018ONE TO SEVENTEEN\u2019). Man Henry can\u2019t remember the accident itself, and though Boy Henry does, he doesn\u2019t want to revisit that trauma. They imagine Katie on Henry\u2019s date \u2013 in a gallery with a perfect boyfriend \u2013 staring at a black canvas, \u2018a tragic life devoid of colour\u2019. But what does it mean? Henrys wake up in Stoke Mandeville Hospital , meeting the tireless staff, fronted by the no-nonsense Dr Graham (\u2018WORK OF HEART\u2019). The Fraser family are struggling to cope with their shared trauma, with Dom unable to touch his brother, Andrew wondering if it was all his fault, and Fran nearly rejecting Katie\u2019s stacks of cards from his schoolmates \u2013 so terrified is she of what Henry\u2019s life will be like now. Luckily for her, Henry\u2019s \u2018brutal but brilliant\u2019 physio, Agnes, is there to help Fran begin to see that there is life after a life-changing accident and that the key lies in accepting change (\u2018PART OF THE PLAN\u2019).\n\nHenry admits to struggling with acceptance, particularly at night time when he thinks he can hear the sea, so his younger self tries to distract him with joyous memories of their last night on holiday (\u2018UMA VIDA\u2019). The next day, Henry is told he can go outside for the first time in six weeks, and feels his first \u2018little big thing\u2019 in the incredible warmth and colour of the yellow sunlight. But as Andrew pushes his wheelchair back inside, Henry sees his reflection in the hospital doors \u2013 the first time he has seen himself since Portugal \u2013 and he completely breaks down (\u2018WHY?\u2019). His younger self tells him to pull it together for the sake of his family, who are also trying to put on brave faces (\u2018DON\u2019T WANNA HAVE TO\u2019). But Henry is in denial, and doesn\u2019t even want to consider Agnes\u2019s physiotherapy. Agnes tells him that acceptance and adaptation has to come from his family as much as it does him, and reveals that she can see Boy Henry. She suggests reading Katie\u2019s card, which she signed with a bright pink heart. The Henrys read all the messages of support from their loved ones (\u2018THE WORLD IS WAITING\u2019), helping them find the strength to make their way out of hospital eleven months early.\n\nAct 2\n\nAgnes teaches the Fraser family how to \u2018adapt for Henry, not the other way around\u2019, and they set about making their home accessible for his return (\u2018WHAT I NEED\u2019). Henry returns home with a new appreciation: \u2018Was the grass always that green?\u2019. However, he finds a different house than the one he left, with his bed in the living room, and even Dom having to take the role as carer. Henry has done so much work, but still hasn\u2019t faced the trauma of his accident, and begs Boy Henry to revisit the day on the beach, which he does, painfully (\u2018SILENCE OF THE SEA\u2019). For the first time, Dom sleeps beside Henry and holds his hand: \u2018I felt a warmth I never had before. It\u2019s like the whole room glowed bright orange\u2019.\n\nTrying to find a way forward, Agnes takes Fran and the Henrys on an emancipating night out clubbing (\u2018THINGS WE SHOULDN\u2019T DO\u2019), which is great fun until they get home, and find a worried Andrew, Tom and Will. The family get into a huge row, and some terrible things are said, leading to Andrew and Fran storming out, and the Fraser brothers fighting it out between them (\u2018SYMPATHY\u2019). Man Henry breaks it up by telling them they can never go back to how it was and that all of them need to forget Boy. Andrew returns, apologising about the fight, and shows Henry his new invention: an adapted stylus using his \u2018purple protector\u2019 gum shield, so that he can make art on his tablet, using his mouth. Henry is grateful but doesn\u2019t know what to create, and asks his dad what he would paint. Andrew daydreams about good times with the entire Fraser family on his big red boat (\u2018MILES AND MILES\u2019), and feels some relief in \u2018letting go\u2019 of Boy. Henry finds freedom and joy in painting, and doesn\u2019t stop \u2013 creating more and more art using his mouth - so many paintings in fact that Fran has secretly arranged a gallery showing, via Agnes, for all his pieces.\n\nHenry goes about inviting all the people from his life to his gallery, including Katie, who he finally gets to take on a date. But before the exhibition itself, he wants the entire Fraser family to go to the beach, and finally look at the bright blue sea. Andrew admits that he sold his boat because they\u2019re a team, and him and Fran find some healing in his sacrifice. Henry tells his brothers that they need to let go of the trauma of the accident, and remember Boy how he\u2019d like: nearly as happy as he is now. Agnes drops by to tell the Henrys that the gallery want a big centre-piece for the showing, something \u2018personal\u2019, and Henry finally builds up the courage to ask her how he can stop seeing the Boy. She tells him that they never leave, but when you find peace and acceptance, they \u2018take a step back\u2019. Henry asks his younger self to help him paint the big centrepiece, where they celebrate their story together and use the pain of their past, to find joy in the present (\u2018GUIDE YOU\u2019). Boy tells Henry that he would go on the holiday all over again, and that he can\u2019t wait to be him, before Henry can finally let him go.\n\nThe day of the gallery arrives, and Fran and Andrew take a sneak peek of the centre-piece, which is revealed to be a painting of Andrew\u2019s boat. In that moment, Andrew sees a new future for Henry, and is so proud of his son. Henry braces himself to face his audience \u2013 mirroring the opening of the show \u2013 where he tells us about his story \u2013 a story about his life- changing accident at the age of seventeen, and how he wouldn\u2019t be who he is without it (\u2018THE LITTLE BIG THINGS\u2019).",

        "title": "Wish You Were Here (musical)",
        "description": "Wish You Were Here is a musical with a book by Arthur Kober and Joshua Logan and music and lyrics by Harold Rome . The musical was adapted from Kober's 1937 play, Having Wonderful Time , and revolves around a summer camp for adults. It is known for the song \" Wish You Were Here \".",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe show opens with a P.A. announcement welcoming a busload of new guests to Camp Karefree, a two-week summer camp for adults in the Catskills . Camp host Lou Kandel gives the newcomers, mostly women, the rundown of the place; first, he introduces the waiters, mostly college men. Then he tells everyone the two rules - Camp Karefree cares for you, and when the lights flicker the girls go to the girls' side and the boys go to the boys' (\"Camp Karefree Song\").\n\nEnter Teddy Stern, a young woman soon to be wed to a stuffy, older man: Herman Fabricant. Teddy has been crying uncontrollably since her engagement, so her doctor suggested she get some rest before the wedding. Teddy's friend Fay, a screwball blonde, meets her and takes her under her wing. Herman leaves. After he is gone, Teddy confesses she is having second thoughts about her marriage, and that is why the doctor said she needed a change. With that, Fay takes Teddy's wedding ring - just for the time that they are at camp - so Teddy can have a real change. Fay introduces the now \"single\" Teddy to her friends (\"There's Nothing Nicer Than People\"). Teddy then meets Itchy Flexner, the social director who does it all: imitations, singing, dancing, and telling stories. He just loves to entertain (\"Social Director\"). He engages the entire camp with his talent. An announcement over the loudspeaker tells everyone to change for dinner. As she heads to her cabin, Teddy meets Pinky Harris - a dashing, womanizing fellow who takes an interest in her. After Teddy has changed for dinner, she notices Fay flirting with Harry \"Muscles\" Green - the new athletic director. It seems that Fay has her eye on every available man at Camp Karefree. She confesses that she just loves to flirt (\"Shopping Around\"). The scene shifts to the locker room for the waiters listlessly wipe the water glasses and reflect on what they have to do to put themselves through school (\"Bright College Days\").\n\nKandel enters and reminds the waiters that part of their job is to entertain the ladies - all of them, not just the pretty ones - by dancing and talking with them. Chick, a law student, is tired of being a waiter by day and gigolo by night - he wants to meet a real girl, not these eager beavers, as he calls them, at Camp Karefree. But the boys remind him it is either socializing or getting fired (\"Mix and Mingle\"). On the Social Hall Porch, the girls want to dance, but the men are playing poker. When the waiters arrive, the girls rush inside excitedly to dance with them. Teddy, however, does not feel like dancing. She listens to the other girls speculate that tonight could be the night they fall in love, looks at her ring finger, and starts crying (\"Could Be\"). Chick casually enters and stands unaware of Teddy. Schmutz, one of Itchy's assistants, enters and tells Chick that he better start dancing because word has gotten back to Kandel that Chick would not dance with one of the girls. Chick quickly convinces the reluctant Teddy to dance with him just as Kandel enters. Inside the social hall, Itchy directs everyone in a get-acquainted dance (\"Tripping the Light Fantastic\").\n\nIn the end, ready to escort her home, Chick is still with Teddy and thanks her for getting him out of a tight spot. It is here that Pinky makes it very evident that he has designs on Teddy. In fact, he wants Itchy to help him survey the situation and see just how he can lure Teddy to him. Itchy agrees - on the condition Pinky gets him a TV audition. Next, Muscles comes over and asks Itchy for advice on wooing a girl. Itchy is happy to oblige, until he finds out the girl is Fay who Itchy also wants! To Itchy's dismay, Muscles and Fay leave together. (\"Social Director - Reprise\"). Walking through the woods, Chick and Teddy hear the band playing the song Chick sang in the waiter's show last year. It is about a boy and a girl who met at camp, and the following season she did not come back (\" Wish You Were Here \"). They run into Fay who had gone to Eagle Rock with Muscles but was interrupted by a scheming Itchy. When she leaves, Chick explains that he cannot get involved with Teddy - he is putting all his time and attention towards Law School.\n\nTeddy understands, she too cannot get involved, though she does not tell Chick the reason why. Chick thinks this is perfect. Chick has trouble with the socializing part of his job because all of the girls he is supposed to romance want long-term contact. Since Teddy does not, he asks her if she will spend the next two weeks with him. She happily agrees. They dance the last dance of the evening together and go off to bed - alone (\"Where Did the Night Go\"). A week later, Muscles is exhausting everyone on the athletic field. Itchy has to cancel evening activities because everyone is too tired to show up. Kandel tells Itchy that if the social events do not pick up, Itchy will lose his job as social director. Meanwhile, Pinky tells Teddy he has just ordered a new formal dress in her size that is meant to be the prize for the Miss Karefree bathing beauty contest. He is one of the judges and wants her to enter. Teddy ignores this obvious pass and goes off with Chick.\n\nFay flirts with Muscles and Itchy gets increasingly jealous. Teddy and Chick return on Chick's bicycle and are greeted by the entire camp. Though they see their relationship as a friendship, everyone else sees a blossoming romance (\"Certain Individuals\"). Everyone leaves except for the spurned Itchy who watches Fay ride off on Muscles' shoulders. Itchy decides that he has got to get some new social ideas that will excite the girls. He decides to have a candlelight evening in the social hall. He figures that will be so romantic that all the girls will forget Muscles and his sports events. Unfortunately, his plan backfires when the Social Hall catches fire. Kandel is so mad at Itchy that he demotes him to Boat House Boy and puts Muscles in charge of all social events.\n\nThe next day Chick takes Teddy out to Eagle Rock, yelling at Pinky to stay away from her. When Teddy asks what has come over him, Chick reveals that he loves Teddy. He proposes marriage and imagines how his friends would react to their going out together to museums and cultural events (\"They Won't Know Me\"). Teddy tells Chick that not only is she already engaged, but she is also meant to get married next week. Even though she, too, loves Chick she cannot call off the wedding. Rather than talk any more about it, they go back to the camp. Back at the boathouse, we find Itchy has been demoted to Boat Boy. Teddy and Chick return from Eagle Rock and Chick confronts Fay about Teddy's engagement. She confesses that she knew all along that Teddy was engaged and gives Teddy her ring back. The girls enter in their bathing suits - ready for the Miss Camp Karefree Contest. Gussie, one of the available girls rushes forward and shows Chick that she has no ring on her finger. He asks her out and plans on cheering for her in the contest. Teddy, hurt, decides that she too will enter the contest, in retaliation. Pinky is thrilled to have the chance to put the moves on Teddy (\"Summer Afternoon\"). Pinky naturally picks Teddy to win the contest. He shows her the gorgeous new dress. In return, she gives him a kiss, and in a jealous fit, Chick pushes Pinky into the pool.\n\nKandel has Chick restrained and threatens to fire him. Pinky delights in watching this happen to Chick and laughs. Teddy, upset at seeing Chick humiliated, pushes Pinky into the pool. Nevertheless, Chick still leaves with Gussie and Teddy watches them go, crying.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe act opens the evening after the beauty contest with the camp sitting around a campfire (\"Where Did the Night Go? - Reprise\"). Fay returns to tell Pinky that Teddy will not meet him. She is too ashamed of the way things have gone. Teddy's been talking to her mother in New York, and Fay suspects that Herman may be back to pick Teddy up soon. Pinky thinks if Teddy hears them having fun, she will come to join them. Itchy performs a rousing number that he hopes will both draw out Teddy and win Fay back (\"Don Jose\").\n\nUnfortunately, Fay ends up kissing Muscles at the end of the song. Itchy has a jealous fight with Muscles over Fay. She breaks up the fight. Chick returns to apologize to Pinky though there still is a great deal of tension between the two of them. Fay passes drinks to around to the fighting men and tells them just to get along for tonight (\"Everybody Love Everybody\"). When Teddy's name is called over the P.A. to come and get her long-distance call, Pinky convinces Chick to sing to Teddy. Swallowing his drink, he does (\"Wish You Were Here\"). Teddy enters the scene and sees Chick though the two do not speak. Gussie quickly laps up Chick when he finishes singing and Pinky tries to get Teddy drunk and take her back to his cabin. Before anything more happens, it starts raining and everyone runs for cover. Teddy stops by Pinky's cabin ostensibly to pick up an umbrella, but he has other ideas. He spikes Teddy's drink and attempts to take advantage of her (\"Relax\"). Itchy comes over to talk with Pinky and a panicked Teddy hides in the bathroom while Pinky attempts to get rid of Itchy.\n\nBy the time Itchy leaves, Teddy has emerged from the bathroom with an empty glass wearing the sexy dress she won in the beauty contest. Chick enters the bunk with Teddy's engagement ring and finding her there attempts to force the ring on her finger. If she is engaged, she should act like it. She tells him to mind his own business. He puts the ring on the night table and leaves. Pinky prepares to take her to bed; unfortunately, while he is in the bathroom getting changed, she falls asleep. Pinky, not knowing what else to do, slips the engagement ring on Teddy's hand. The next morning outside the social hall, Herman has come to bring Teddy home. No one seems to know where Teddy is, and Herman is not too happy about this. Itchy and Marvin also bemoan the fact that their girlfriends are nowhere to be found. They then realize that the girls have spent the whole night dancing to Be-Bop records in the music library. Fay and some of the other kids enter dancing like \"cool cats\" (\"Where Did the Night Go? - Be-bop Version\"). Muscles take the guests off to play basketball, and Teddy enters, finding Herman. It appears that even though nothing happened between Teddy and Pinky, Pinky is out accepting congratulations for his conquest. Even though Herman should not accept Teddy's behavior, he is ready to forgive and forget. He wants to take Teddy back to New York where the two can get married.\n\nShe goes to get the car. Itchy returns to tell everyone that he has been fired from his job as Boat Boy, too. He forgot to tie up the boats last night during the storm and they all floated away. Teddy spots Chick escorting a new girl to her cabin and informs him that she is leaving. He is aloof but polite. Itchy, overhearing the conversation, chastises Teddy for not putting up a fight. Chick does not even know the truth about what happened between her and Pinky. Itchy wants her to go over to the big camp basketball game and make Pinky, the referee, tell the truth. Teddy is flattered that Itchy cares so much. His kind words really give her a lift. And she returns the sentiment in kind (\"Flattery\"). She agrees to go to the game. In the game, the camp team (led by Muscles) plays the waiter team (led by Chick). Itchy arrives and disrupts the game so badly that Muscles declares the game officially over.\n\nTeddy confronts Pinky and asks him why he is telling everyone she succumbed to him last night. He claims that he did no such thing; however, the rest of the camp is having a great time insinuating that Teddy is now a loose woman. Pinky resists because he does not want to tarnish his reputation, but Fay gets him to tell the truth. Herman hears this and is relieved. Teddy gives a kiss to Chick and gets in the car and leaves with Herman. It is obvious that she does not want to go, but Chick does nothing to stop her. Muscles, frustrated with the interruption of his game, he quits on the spot. Kandel panics! Who is going to run the camp? Itchy, of course! Itchy immediately organize everyone to dance. Suddenly, Herman re-enters with two suitcases, which he lays down. Teddy runs to Chick and falls into his arms. Before Herman goes, however, he gives Chick the engagement ring, which Chick slips on Teddy's finger (\"Wish You Were Here - Reprise\").",

        "title": "The Go-Between",
        "description": "The Go-Between is a novel by L. P. Hartley published in 1953. His best-known work, it has been adapted several times for stage and screen. The book gives a critical view of society at the end of the Victorian era through the eyes of a na\u00efve schoolboy outsider.",
        "synopsis": "In the book's prologue, Leo Colston chances upon a diary from 1900, the year of his thirteenth birthday, and gradually pieces together a memory that he has suppressed. Under its influence, and from the viewpoint of what he has become by the midpoint of \"this hideous century\", Leo relives the events of what had once seemed to him its hopeful beginning. The importance of his boarding school's social rules is another theme running through the book and complicates Leo's interaction with the adult world.\n\n\"Curses\" of his devising had routed boys who were bullying Leo at school and had given him the reputation of a magician, something that he came to half-believe himself. As a result, he is invited as a guest to spend the summer at Brandham Hall, the country home of his school friend Marcus Maudsley, who comes from a wealthy family. The Maudsleys are renting Brandham Hall from the aristocratic Hugh, Viscount Trimingham, the descendant of the area's nobility; Mrs Maudsley intends her daughter Marian to marry Trimingham in order to consolidate the family's social position. The socially clumsy Leo, with his regional accent, is a middle-class boy among the wealthy upper class. Although he does not fit into this society, his hosts do their best to make him feel welcome, treating him with kindness and indulgence, especially Marian.\n\nWhen Marcus falls ill, Leo is left largely to his own devices and becomes a secret \"postman\" for Marian and nearby tenant farmer Ted Burgess, with whom she is having a clandestine relationship. Leo is happy to help Marian because he has a crush on her and likes Ted. Besides, Leo is initially ignorant of the significance or content of the messages that he is asked to carry between them, and the well-meaning, innocent boy is easily manipulated by the lovers. Although Marian and Ted are fully aware of the social taboo that must make their relationship a matter of the utmost secrecy, Leo is too na\u00efve to understand why they never can marry.\n\nAs he begins to comprehend that the relationship between Marian and Ted is not to do with \"business\" as they have claimed, Leo naively believes that Marian's engagement to Trimingham ought to bring the correspondence between her and Ted to an end. Feeling increasingly uncomfortable about the general atmosphere of deception and risk, Leo tries to end his role as go-between but comes under great psychological pressure, and he is forced to continue. Ultimately, his unwilling involvement has disastrous consequences when Marian's mother makes him accompany her as she tracks the lovers to their hiding place and discovers them having sex. The trauma that results leads directly to Ted's suicide and Leo's nervous collapse.\n\nIn the epilogue, the older Leo summarises how profoundly the experience has affected him. Forbidding himself to think about the scandal, he had shut down his emotions and imaginative nature, leaving room only for facts. As a result, he never has been able to establish intimate relationships. Now, looking back on the events through the eyes of a mature adult, he feels it is important to return to Brandham some 50 years later in order to tie up loose ends. There he meets Marian's grandson and finds Marian living in her former nanny's cottage. He also learns that Trimingham had married Marian and acknowledged Ted's son by her as his own. Trimingham had died in 1910; Marcus and his elder brother had died in World War I, and Marian's son died in World War II. In the end, the elderly Marian persuades Leo, the only other survivor from her past, to act once more as go-between and assure her estranged grandson that there was nothing to be ashamed of in her affair with Ted Burgess.",

        "title": "Pacific Overtures",
        "description": "Pacific Overtures is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim , and a book by John Weidman , with \"additional material by\" Hugh Wheeler .\n\nSet in nineteenth-century Japan, it tells the story of the country's westernization starting in 1853, when American ships forcibly opened it to the rest of the world. The story is told from the point of view of the Japanese, and focuses in particular on the lives of two friends who are caught in the change.\n\nSondheim wrote the score in a quasi-Japanese style of parallel 4ths and no leading-tone . He did not use the pentatonic scale ; the 4th degree of the major scale is represented from the opening number through the finale, as Sondheim found just five pitches too limiting. The music contrasts Japanese contemplation (\"There Is No Other Way\") with Western ingenuousness (\"Please Hello\"), while over the course of the 127 years Western harmonies, tonality, and even lyrics are infused into the score. The score is generally considered to be one of Sondheim's most ambitious and sophisticated efforts.\n\nThe original Broadway production of Pacific Overtures in 1976 was staged in Kabuki style, with men playing women's parts and set changes made in full view of the audience by black-clad stagehands . It opened to mixed reviews and closed after six months, despite being nominated for ten Tony Awards .\n\nGiven its specific casting and production demands, Pacific Overtures remains one of Stephen Sondheim 's least-performed musicals. The show is occasionally staged by opera companies. The cast requires an abundance of male Asian actors who must play male and female parts. As written, women join the ensemble for only half of the last song; all other principal female roles are played by men, as was traditional in Kabuki theatre. In the original production the five female cast members appeared throughout the show in small roles and as stagehands, and more recent productions, including the 2004 Broadway revival, did away with the device of men playing the majority of the women's roles.\n\nThe most recent revival in 2017 at Classic Stage Company , helmed by John Doyle and starring George Takei as The Reciter, featured a cast of only 10 people, 8 men and 2 women. This also featured a revised book by John Weidman that had a running time of 90 minutes (as compared to the previous 2 hour 30 minute original run time).",

As such, some musical numbers and subplots are not accounted for.\n\n### Act One\n\nAs a ship bearing hopeful immigrants steams toward Ellis Island , a lone passenger reflects on the life he has left behind (\"I Remember\").  Rebecca Hershkowitz, a Jewish woman, has fled Russia with her young son David, hoping to find her husband, Nathan, who left for America years before and never wrote back to his family.  Rebecca has made friends with Bella Cohen, a teenager emigrating to America with her father Avram (\"If We Never Meet Again\"); her brother Herschel remains behind in Russia.  Bella has fallen in love with Ben, another passenger, but Avram does not approve.\n\nOn Ellis Island, the unfeeling immigration officials treat the immigrants like animals (\"Greenhorns\").  With no male relative to claim them, Rebecca and David are in danger of immediate deportation until Bella begs Avram to rescue her friend.  Avram pretends that Rebecca is his niece, and persuades his brother, who lives in a tenement on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to let Rebecca and David stay for the night.  Bella, Rebecca and David marvel at the strange new sights in the streets below (\"Brand New World\").  Rebecca still feels lonely, and wishes that she can give her son a real home (\"Children of The Wind\").\n\nRebecca searches for her husband and takes a job sewing in a sweatshop, while David helps Rachel, a widow, selling trinkets out of her market stall.  Bella works at home as a seamstress; confined to the tenement, she pines for Ben.  Ben pretended that he had a wealthy uncle who would provide for him, but in reality, he has no uncle and works in a cigar factory.  Avram, though an educated man in \"the old country,\" hawks goods as a street vendor.  Even so, the new immigrants remain upbeat (\"Penny A Tune\").  However, the business owners in the neighborhood are preyed upon by Mr. Rosen, a greedy man who demands they pay him for protection from his thugs.\n\nSaul, a union supporter, confronts Rebecca, urging her to open her eyes to her poor treatment and unfair wages; he suggests that she better herself through education.  Saul teaches Rebecca and David how to speak English, and tries to instill American values in them (\"Easy For You\").  To broaden their horizons, he takes them to see Hamlet as performed by a Jewish theatre troupe (\"Hard To Be A Prince\").  Rebecca realizes that she is falling in love with Saul (\"Blame It On The Summer Night\").\n\nBen comes to visit Bella, and admits he is only a factory worker.  He has a new plan, to sell gramophones , and demonstrates one for her (\"For My Mary\").  As they dance, Avram returns and throws Ben out, forbidding Bella from ever seeing the boy again.  Bella flies into a rage and accuses her father of not allowing her to achieve her own American dream (\"Rags\").\n\nMeanwhile, Nathan, Rebecca's husband, is contemplating his position in the ranks of Tammany Hall , where he is promised great things if he manages to secure the Jewish vote for an anti-union Democratic candidate (\"What's Wrong With That?\").  He believes his wife is still in Russia until he discovers that she has placed an ad in the paper seeking him.\n\nAt the street market, Mr. Rosen comes to collect his bribes from the shopkeepers.  Emboldened by the Socialist doctrine Saul has taught him, David stands up for Rachel and is beaten by Rosen's thugs.  Rebecca blames Saul for corrupting her son and vows that she won't be fooled by any more idealistic notions of America.  Nathan suddenly arrives to collect his wife and son (\"Nothing Will Hurt Us Again\").\n\n### Act Two\n\nNathan explains to Rebecca and David how he has managed to climb up from the ghetto of the lower East side to a better life (\"Yankee Boy\").  Rebecca is unsettled that her husband has given himself the American name \"Nat Harris\" and distances himself from the Jewish community; however, she also likes the idea of having a better life for her son (\"Uptown\").  She also longs for Saul, though they both realize their love can never be (\"Wanting\").\n\nAvram and Rachel have fallen in love, enabling Avram to move out of his brother's house and provide Bella with a more stable family life (\"Three Sunny Rooms\").  Bella and David help Ben sell his \"Magic Music Machine\" to excited customers (\"The Sound Of Love\").  The three are natural salesmen, and Bella is delighted to think that soon they will have enough money to marry.  To help out, she goes against her father's wishes and takes a job at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory (\"Rags\" reprise).\n\nRebecca accompanies Nathan to a costume party and feels unhappy with her husband, who acts ashamed of her.  When David interrupts the party to tell Rebecca of a fire at Bella's shop, Nathan forbids her to leave.  Knowing Bella is in danger, she goes anyway, but it is too late. Bella has jumped to her death from the burning building. Avram is destroyed by the death of his daughter, and Rebecca is confused and guilty (\"Kaddish\").\n\nRebecca leads the sweatshop workers in a strike protesting the unsafe conditions that led to the deaths of the girls at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory (\"Bread and Freedom\"). As the demonstration reaches near-riot levels, Nathan shows up to try to persuade his wife to come home with him. Rebecca sees Saul in the crowd and knows she must follow her heart and stand up for what is right (\"Dancing With The Fools\").  She refuses Nathan.\n\nAvram is still grieving for Bella and is planning to return to Russia and the son, Herschel, he left behind when Ben comes to pay his respects.  He tells Avram that leaving America would mean Bella died for nothing and gives him the gramophone, which plays a recording of Bella's voice.  While Rebecca sings of her new life with Saul and David, Rachel and Avram welcome Herschel off the boat as a new wave of immigrants arrives (\"Children of The Wind reprise/Finale\").",

        "title": "The Frogs (musical)",
        "description": "The Frogs is a musical \"freely adapted\" by Stephen Sondheim and Burt Shevelove from The Frogs , an Ancient Greek comedy by Aristophanes . In the musical, Dionysos , despairing of the quality of living dramatists , travels to Hades to bring George Bernard Shaw back from the dead. William Shakespeare competes with Shaw for the title of best playwright, which he wins. Dionysos brings Shakespeare back to the world of the living in the hope that art can save civilization.\n\nThe musical was originally performed in Yale University 's gymnasium 's swimming pool in 1974. The show was produced on Broadway in 2004 with the book revised by Nathan Lane and the score expanded by Sondheim. This version was revived in London in 2017 and 2025.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe show opens with two \"actors,\" played by the same actors as the main characters of the play but considered different in the libretto, discussing which play they should perform. One actor suggests \" the one about the man who kills his father and sleeps with his mother \", but the other actor is in too good a mood for tragedy and they decide to perform a comedy instead. However, before they can perform, they must make an invocation : dedicating the performance to the theatre gods, and instructing the audience how to behave (\"Invocation and Instructions to the Audience\"). Just as they are about to further delay the action, the Chorus enters demanding the actors begin.\n\nThe Actors return as Dionysos , god of wine and drama, and his slave Xanthias. Dionysos is in despair about the state of the world, and has decided to travel to Hades to bring back the great writer George Bernard Shaw , who Dionysos believes will speak to society and help with its problems (\"It Is Time We Start Our Journey\") (\"I Love to Travel\"). His first stop is at the house of his half-brother Heracles to gain advice on how to enter Hades. Heracles says that Dionysos should don a lion-skin and pretend to be Heracles, and instructs the rather weak-willed god in proper heroic behaviour (\"Dress Big\"). The lesson seems to take, although Dionysos soon reverts to his old self. Heracles also warns them of the Frogs, dangerous creatures who live on the River Styx and are terrified of change .\n\nThe pair travel to the Styx (\"I Love to Travel (Reprise)\"), where they meet the severely depressive ferryman, Charon (\"All Aboard\"). Charon agrees to take Xanthias and Dionysos to the Underworld, and claims that there are no Frogs on the river. Traveling on the River, Dionysos recounts the (mythologically accurate) story of his deceased wife Ariadne (\"On The River Styx\"). When he took her to Mount Olympus to marry her, she was worried that she could not compare to the Olympian gods, he made her a crown of stars to help her look like a goddess. However, as she was only a mortal, she died soon afterwards, and Dionysos threw her crown back into the sky. He says he is glad that there are no stars in Hell (\"Ariadne\").\n\nLater that night, Dionysos is awoken by a cry of \"brek-ek-ek-ek!\" He soon works out that the Frogs have come; they drag him out of the boat and tempt him into a life of frogdom, hopping around without any cares or worries (\"The Frogs\"). Although Dionysos is briefly rescued by Xanthias, the Frogs return while Xanthias is distracted, and drag Dionysos back into the water.\n\n### Act II\n\nDionysos climbs back on the boat drenched and covered with weeds, still quivering from his horrible confrontation with the frogs. Undaunted, Charon steers them to the dock, where Dionysos and Xanthias disembark. They run into Dionysian worshipers (\"Hymn to Dionysos\"), but Xanthias reminds Dionysos of their mission, and they continue to the Palace of Pluto.\n\nAeakos , keeper of the keys to the palace, sees Dionysos in his Heracles disguise and vows vengeance on the god who slew the three-headed watchdog of Hades . At the urging of Dionysos, Xanthias dons the Heracles suit, and they encounter Charisma , the beautiful handmaiden to Persephone . Mistaking Xanthias for Heracles, she invites him to a sensuous bath in hippopotamus milk. Tantalized, Dionysos takes back the lion skin and encounters Virilla, Queen of the Amazons, who accuses him (Dionysos, again dressed as Heracles) of stealing the girdle of her leader Hippolyte .\n\nAt the height of all the confusion, Pluto enters, surrounded by the flames of Hades. Dionysos sheds his Heracles disguise, and Pluto welcomes the god with open arms, disabusing him of the misconception that Hades is a dangerous place (\"Hades\").\n\nDionysos tells Pluto of his plan to bring Shaw back to earth, and Pluto reveals that all the dead playwrights are banqueting at his palace at that very moment. As Pluto and Dionysos discuss the dire situation on Earth, the Greek Chorus offers ironic commentary to the audience: though serious matters are being weighed onstage, there is no cause for alarm (\"It's Only a Play\").\n\nFollowing the banquet, Dionysos bursts out of the palace to proclaim the entrance of George Bernard Shaw and his loyal passel of Shavians (\"Shaw\"). When William Shakespeare emerges from the palace, the philosophical tension between the two titans escalates swiftly until they almost come to blows. Dionysos defuses the situation by declaring a contest between the two playwrights. Each will address the important issues of humanity using only the words of his own writings.\n\nThe supporters of Shaw and Shakespeare assemble into an arena where the verbal battle begins. Dionysos, high in his referee's chair, calls out the topics: first woman, then man, then the Life Force. Shaw and Shakespeare are sharp in their responses, Shaw delivering his pointed orations and Shakespeare responding with his poetic imagery. Grappling for a final topic (and concerned whether the people of earth will accept Shaw's rigorous social views), Dionysos calls a time-out. His deceased wife Ariadne appears, comforting her husband and advising him to follow his heart. Looking lovingly into his eyes, Ariadne assures Dionysos that the final topic is \"staring you in the face\".\n\nThe contest resumes, and Dionysos announces the final topic: Death. Shaw responds with a stirring passage from Saint Joan , and the crowd is hushed. Then Shakespeare speaks of death from an old man's point of view (\"The Contest\"). Dionysos, wanting to hear more asks him to speak of a young man's feelings. Shakespeare's response is the song (\"Fear No More\") from Cymbeline . The powerful poetry moves Dionysos to declare Shakespeare the winner and offer him passage to the world of the living. A disgruntled Shaw is dragged kicking and screaming from the stage as Charon the boatman announces the return trip (\"All Aboard\").\n\nXanthias, who has elected to remain in Hades with the Amazon Virilla, bids his master farewell, as the voices of Ariadne and the chorus accompany Dionysos home (\"Hymn to Dionysos (Reprise)\"). Dionysos and Shakespeare arrive back at the same theatre that the actors were at in the beginning. Dionyus beckons Shakespeare to speak, and the playwright responds by calling for a new play to be written to inspire humanity. As the entire company is revealed, Dionysos steps forward and addresses the audience. He urges us to shake off lethargy, to take action to resolve the earthly problems that plague our times (\"Final Instructions to the Audience\"). And with that, his mission is complete.",

Mitri, and David S. Stone, in association with Barbara & Emery Olcott.",
        "synopsis": "### Prelude\n\n### Act I\n\nGeneva, 1769; a child prodigy, Victor lives a happy and privileged childhood with his father and mother. When Victor is seven years old, his mother gives birth to his brother, William. By 1789, Victor has grown into a vibrant and incredibly intelligent young man. He is accepted to the University of Ingolstadt, where he decides to study science. Victor's mother dies of scarlet fever, inspiring him to research the secrets of life and death (\"A Golden Age\").\n\nVictor decides to leave home to further research his theories. He bids farewell to his family, his best friend Henry, and his cousin, also his fianc\u00e9e, Elizabeth. Victor makes a promise to Elizabeth that he will return to her. (\"Find Your Way Home\"). Victor visits his mother's grave before he leaves, and declares he shall see her again for he has discovered how to reanimate the dead. Victor demonstrates this by successfully bringing a dead sparrow back to life. At Ingolstadt Victor's theories are met with outrage, labeled as \"Madness, folly, and insanity.\" Determined to prove his theories to the world Victor attends the hanging of an unnamed, condemned man and, after the man is dead, claims the body for his experiment (\"Amen\"). Inside his lab at the University, Victor comprises a man, approximately eight feet in height, of carefully selected limbs and organs. Harnessing the power of a ferocious lightning storm, he tries to endow his creation with life (\"Birth to My Creation\"). At first, the experiment seems unsuccessful and Victor feverishly looks over his notes to see what could have gone wrong (\"1:15 AM\"). Elizabeth has been writing to Victor constantly, although he has never written back. As Elizabeth writes her last letter back in Geneva, Victor finally looks over the letters he has ignored. Realizing he has been neglecting his loved ones, Victor longs to return home and forget about his failure. Suddenly, a loud scream emits from the laboratory and Victor rushes in to investigate. He discovers that his creation has indeed come to life, but it is so hideous in appearance that Victor, terrified, sets fire to his laboratory, and believes the Creature has perished in the flames (\"Dear Victor/Burn the Laboratory\").\n\nHaving received no word from Victor during his time at Ingolstadt, Henry, Elizabeth, William, and Victor's father worry about what has become of him. Victor is in a hospital, suffering from mental shock. Authorities await his recovery to question him about the fire in the lab. (\"The Hands of Time\"). Victor's father, anxious for Victor's return, states that no matter what road his son chooses to take in life, he will always believe in him (\"Your Father's Eyes\").\n\nOnce Victor recovers he is brought to trial for setting the fire, however he is released due to lack of evidence. Vowing to give up his interest in science Victor quickly returns home to Geneva, but returns to hear that his brother, William, has been murdered. The culprit is believed to be William's nanny, Justine Moritz, after she is found with a bloodstained locket belonging to William. Justine protests her innocence, placing the blame on a \"monster\".\n\nVictor discovers the Creature and is horrified that he survived the fire in the lab. The Creature, now intelligent and capable of speech, is lonely and in pain. The Creature expresses his anguish and how he expected love and acceptance, only to find himself an object of hatred and fear (\"The Waking Nightmare\"). He forces Victor to listen to the story of his days since his creation (\"The Creature's Tale\").\n\nAfter escaping the burning lab, the confused Creature found his way to a cabin in the woods inhabited by an old blind man, his daughter Agatha, and her infant child. The Creature, hiding in the woodshed next to the cabin, observed the family through a crack in the wall. Hearing them sing the infant to sleep touched the Creature and awakened his longing to feel the same tenderness (\"The Music of Love\"). Determined to earn the love of the family, the Creature began to leave food and firewood at their door during the day and listen to them speak at night, in order to learn their language. When he finally felt confident that he could successfully approach the old man, the Creature entered the cabin when Agatha had gone. Since the old man was blind, he was not repulsed by the Creature's ugliness and accepted him as a friend. Overjoyed, the Creature embraced the old man, accidentally crushing him with his incredible strength. Distraught that he had killed his only friend the Creature left the cabin, never to return. Remembering his creator, the Creature embarked on a mission to rob Victor of his happiness and loved ones in an attempt to make Victor realize the pain of loneliness. The Creature traveled to Geneva and came upon William and Justine sitting in a field. The Creature listened while William asked Justine endless questions about the world (\"Why?\"). Justine and William then ran off into the woods together, however only Justine returned. William was reported missing and soon after found strangled to death. The Creature reveals that it was indeed he that murdered the boy and planted the locket on Justine. Here, the Creature ends his tale.\n\nQuaking with rage, Victor attempts to fight his creation but is easily overpowered. The Creature tries to persuade Victor to create an equally hideous female companion for him. Victor refuses, until the Creature vows to leave with his bride and never return. Hoping that creating a bride for the Creature will atone for his previous mistakes, Victor promises. Justine is hanged for William's murder (\"The Proposition\").\n\n### Act II\n\nVictor's family celebrates his upcoming marriage to Elizabeth, however the celebration is somewhat somber due to William's death (\"A Happier Day\"). Henry begins to suspect that Victor is hiding something and determines to discover what it is. Victor, anxious to appease the Creature and end his family's suffering, begins to create a female creature, from the corpse of Justine. Henry enters the lab and confronts his friend, berating him for his actions. Trying to protect Victor, he vows to expose his creation to the world, causing the Creature to kill him in retaliation (\"The Modern Prometheus\"). Victor succeeds in bringing the Creature's bride to life, but kills her once the thought of the two having children enters his mind. The distraught Creature vows revenge on his creator, promising to be there on Victor's wedding night (\"Another Like Him\").\n\nVictor and Elizabeth are married and leave for their honeymoon (\"The Workings of the Heart\"). Afraid that the Creature may be hiding close by, Victor leaves Elizabeth locked in their room while he goes to search. Seeing that she is alone, The Creature sneaks into the room and murders Elizabeth (\"An Angel's Embrace\").\n\nHeartbroken, Victor stands before Elizabeth's grave and blames himself for her death, along with the deaths of William and Justine (\"The Workings of the Heart - Reprise\"). Victor's father is the last to die, of a broken heart (\"Your Father's Eyes - Reprise\"). Driven over the edge with grief, Victor vows to hunt down his creation.\n\nThe Creature, meanwhile, has been emotionally touched by the love Victor's family had for him, and powerfully expresses his remorse for his deeds and his hatred for the impulse that drove him to kill (\"These Hands\").\n\nVictor chases the Creature across Europe to the Arctic Ocean (\"The Chase\"). Finally alone and as desolate as his Creature, Victor has a revelation and realizes that a man is truly created through his deeds (\"The Coming of the Dawn\").\n\nWalton has been writing his letter in a room other than Victor's on board the ship. While Victor is resting, the Creature enters through a window. The Creature says he has come to watch Victor die, and then destroy himself upon his funeral pyre. Victor, finally realizing his paternal obligations to the Creature, begs for forgiveness and accepts him as his \"son.\" Victor then dies, leaving the Creature to wallow in the sorrow of losing his father. Walton enters the room as the Creature takes Victor into his arms and carries him off into the ice and darkness, never to be seen again (\"Amen - Reprise\").",

Throughout a series of 12 comedy sketches and songs, the special takes an irreverent, but good-natured look at the time-honored dilemmas that children face.\n\nThe musical sketches include: \"How to Eat Like a Child\" (bite a hole in the bottom of the cone and suck out the ice cream.), \"How to Stay Home from School\" (flu, mumps, stomach ache, or maybe all three.), \"How to Understand Parents\" (\"We'll see\" means \"no\", \"Not now\" means \"no\", \"Ask your father\" means \"no\"...), \"How to Laugh Hysterically\" (a young Corey Feldman makes prank phone calls and cracks juvenile jokes before hanging up), \"How to Act After Being Sent to Your Room\" (\"With nothing but my private stereo media center to keep me distracted, I think they overreacted...\"), \"How to Beg for a Dog\" ( Billy Jacoby playing opposite Judith Kahan 's real-life stepson's four-legged friend, \"Bandit\"), \"How to Torture Your Sister\" (a quartet of boys antagonizing their female siblings), \"How to Deal with Injustice\" (having to walk to the candy store when the adults can just get in a car and drive), \"How to Practice the Violin\" (a pre-adolescent Georg Olden transforms into rock-star Mick Jagger after growing tired of practicing his violin), and the big finale number, \"How to Refuse to Go to Sleep\".\n\nA couple of the numbers take on more serious issues that children face, including \"How to Wait\" (a segment which depicts a youngster impatiently waiting to be picked up at a bus stop, while addressing a child's anxieties and fears about being left alone), and \"The Kid Inside\" (a song in which Van Dyke provides an adult's perspective as he confides in the youngsters that children aren't the only ones to experience sadness and disappointment when one of their prized possessions is damaged and/or destroyed).",

Filmed in 1943 but not released until 1946, Road to Utopia is the fourth film of the \" Road to ... \" series. Written by Melvin Frank and Norman Panama , the film is about two vaudeville performers at the turn of the twentieth century who go to Alaska to make their fortune. Along the way they find a map to a secret gold mine. In 1947, Road to Utopia received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay .",
        "synopsis": "Academy Award-winner Robert Benchley introduces the film, explaining that \u201cthe front office\u201d has charged him with explaining the plot \u201cand other vague portions of the film.\u201d\n\nSal and Chester Hooton, an old married couple, are visited by their equally old friend Duke Johnson, and the three reminisce about their previous adventure in the Klondike.\n\nThe film flashes back to the turn of the century. Hooton and Johnson are doing a variety act as \"Prof Zambini and Ghost-O\". Their trick cons people out of money and they run when the hall is raided by the police. They escape and Johnson wants to head for Alaska . Hooton wants to go to New York. They part at the embarkation quay, but Johnson cheats Hooton out of money and when he runs back to challenge him he gets stuck on the ship going to Alaska. They have to work for their passage. While doing housekeeping duties in a cabin, Chester finds a map to a gold mine. McGurk and Sperry enter behind them, but Duke and Chester overpower the thugs and take their place (and their beards) to get off the boat.\n\nMeanwhile, in Alaska, Sal van Hoyden goes to see the owner of the Last Chance dance hall, Ace Larson. She has a story of a map of a gold mine stolen by two men: McGurk and Sperry. Instead of going to the police, Larson assures Sal that he will take care of things. He gives her a job performing in his saloon, an act which infuriates Larson's girlfriend, Kate. Larson tells Kate how he really plans to take Sal's gold mine for the two of them and passionately kisses her.\n\nArriving in Alaska, Chester and Duke find that the entire town is terrified of their personas. They see Sal's singing routine and are both instantly smitten. Sal plays up to both of them in turn: first Chester, then Duke. She invites each to her room at midnight. She doubts they are the real killers, but Ace's lackey, Lebec, reminds her to get the map at all costs.\n\nChester and Duke argue over who gets to hold the map and decide to tear it in half and each man keep his for safekeeping.\n\nDuke and Chester manage to escape by dog sled; initially pulling the sled themselves with the large dog they found acting as passenger. En route, they meet Santa Claus on his sled going in the opposite direction. They find Kate in the snow, who is lying there as part of a ruse, and Sal runs into them while riding her own dog sled. Kate has access to a cabin nearby, and all four stay together there. She chats up first Chester, then Duke, to establish where the map is. Duke confesses he is not McGurk.\n\nSal, now realizing how much she loves Duke, refuses to go along with the plan. But Kate warns her that only Ace can keep them from being killed and the only way to get to him is to give up the map. Sal reluctantly agrees to steal the map while the men sleep, and does so. The two girls leave the next morning with Lebec.\n\nDuke and Chester are confronted by the real McGurk and Sperry and they realize the girls had stolen the map. They still manage to escape and, after a merry chase through the mountains, head back to town. They readopt their McGurk and Sperry personas but are distressed to find the latter are likely to be hanged. They scare off the posse with a stick of dynamite and rescue Sal who is tied in a back room. They leave the lit dynamite in a candlestick just as the real McGurk and Sperry arrive, and they get blown up while the three escape. They escape by dog sled, but the sled overturns.\n\nThe ice splits with Duke and Chester each having one leg on each side as the gap widens. Eventually, this leaves Sal and Chester on opposite sides, with Duke on the side of the mob. He throws the map, wishes them well, and turns to face the mob.\n\nThe movie flashes forward into the film's present, with aged Duke telling Sal and Chester how he escaped the mob. He is then surprised to hear that Chester and Sal have a son. They call for him, and he bears a striking resemblance to Duke. Chester looks into the camera and says, \"We adopted him.\"",

        "title": "Perchance to Dream (musical)",
        "description": "Perchance to Dream is a musical romance with book, lyrics and music by Ivor Novello .  It was the only musical for which Novello wrote lyrics.  The title is a quotation from William Shakespeare 's play Hamlet .  The plot, like many of Novello's plots, is a romantic adventure tale, telling the parallel stories of the fates of several inhabitants of the same house through differing time periods. The stories interconnect and have unforeseen repercussions, one upon the other.\n\nIt opened on the London stage at the Hippodrome Theatre on 21 April 1945.  The show starred Novello as Sir Graham, Valentine Fayre and Bay Fayre; Margaret Rutherford as Lady Charlotte Fayre; Olive Gilbert as Ernestine Flavelle, later called Mrs. Bridport; Roma Beaumont as Melinda Fayre, Melanie and Melody; Muriel Barron as Lydia Lyddington, Veronica Lyddington and Iris; and Bobbie Andrews as William Fayre. Zena Dare was a replacement as Lady Charlotte. Sylvia Cecil replaced Muriel Barron during the run.  It was directed by Jack Minster, with choreography by Frank Staff and Keith Lester. The musical is one of Novello's most successful works and enjoyed an original run of 1,022 performances (the longest of any of Novello's runs) and finally closed on 11 October 1948. It enjoyed many subsequent tours and revivals.  A 2011 revival at the Finborough Theatre , London, was the first professional production since the 1980s.  The hit song of the show was \"We'll Gather Lilacs\".",
        "synopsis": "During the Regency period , Sir Graham Rodney, an impoverished womaniser, is living off the largess of Lady Charlotte, his rich aunt.  He is the owner of a magnificent old Georgian country house, called \"Huntersmoon\".  Lydia Lyddington, a Drury Lane actress, is Sir Graham's lover and lives with him, as does her friend, also an actress.  Sir Graham's hated cousin William Fayre covets Huntersmoon and dogs Sir Graham's steps.  Sir Graham disguises himself to become the notorious highwayman, \"Frenchy\", to pay his debts and add excitement to his life of leisure.  He robs a coach and takes a necklace but finds that the coach contains Lady Fayre and her ward Melinda.  They soon meet at Huntersmoon, and he falls in love with Melinda.  He dies in Melinda's arms after being shot in another highway robbery gone wrong, telling Melinda that they will find each other again in another life, and leaving Lydia pregnant.  Huntersmoon devolves to William and some unhappy ghosts.\n\nMore than three decades later, in the early Victorian era , William's son, Valentine Fayre, owns Huntersmoon.  He is a composer to Queen Victoria .  He marries Veronica Lyddington, the illegitimate daughter of the late Sir Graham and Lydia.  They live amidst the ghosts of their predecessors.  Valentine meets Melanie, Sir Graham's niece; they fall in love and plan to run away together, but Veronica reveals that she is pregnant.   Valentine is in despair when Melanie commits suicide.\n\nIn 1945, Valentine's grandson, Bay Fayre, wins the hand of Melody, the girl who represents the love that he had lost in earlier generations.  The romance finally lays the ghosts to rest and all ends happily.",

        "synopsis": "In the animated fairy tale kingdom of Andalasia, the corrupt and ruthless Queen Narissa is determined to stay in power; her reign will end if her stepson, Prince Edward, ever gets married. Narissa enlists her loyal servant, Nathaniel, to help Edward hunt trolls to distract Edward from searching for his true love .\n\nA young woman named Giselle lives in a forest and dreams of meeting a prince and experiencing a \" happily ever after .\" Edward hears Giselle singing and sets off to find her. Nathaniel frees a captured troll to kill Giselle, but Edward rescues her. She and Edward are instantly attracted to each other and plan to be married the following day.\n\nNarissa disguises herself as an old hag, intercepts Giselle on her way to the wedding, and pushes her into a well. Giselle turns into a live-action version of herself and is teleported to New York City 's Times Square where she becomes frightened and overwhelmed by the harshness and unfamiliarity of her new environment. Meanwhile, Robert Philip, a divorce lawyer, plans to propose to his girlfriend, Nancy. Robert and his six-year-old daughter, Morgan, encounter Giselle while taking a taxi home. Robert reluctantly allows Giselle to stay in his apartment at the insistence of Morgan, who believes that Giselle is a princess.\n\nEdward embarks on a mission to save Giselle, along with Giselle's chipmunk friend Pip; they jump down the well, turn into live-action versions of themselves, and emerge in Times Square. To his dismay, however, Pip discovers that he cannot speak in the real world. Meanwhile, Narissa sends Nathaniel to follow Edward and sabotage his efforts to find Giselle, and gives him three poisoned apples to use on Giselle, saying whoever eats one of the apples will fall into a deep sleep and die at midnight.\n\nNancy arrives to take Morgan to school, and, after seeing Giselle, she assumes Robert has been unfaithful to her and leaves. Robert is initially angry at Giselle, but he ends up spending the day with her to help familiarize her with the city. Giselle questions Robert about his relationship with Nancy and helps the pair reconcile by sending her flowers and an invitation to a costume ball at the Woolworth Building . Nathaniel attempts to give Giselle a poisoned apple twice, but his attempts fail.\n\nEdward locates Giselle at Robert's apartment, but although he is eager to take her home to Andalasia and marry her, she suggests they should first go on a date and get to know each other better. Giselle promises to return to Andalasia after the ball that night, which Robert and Nancy also attend. Nathaniel reports his failure to poison Giselle to Narissa, who furiously decides to enter the real world and kill Giselle herself.\n\nAt the ball, Robert and Giselle dance together. Nancy and Edward look on in dismay, noticing the chemistry between the pair, but also notice each other. Giselle and Edward then prepare to depart, but Giselle begins to feel guilty and anguished for leaving Robert behind. Shortly before midnight, Narissa appears in her old hag form, and offers the last poisoned apple to Giselle, promising that it will erase her memories of Robert. She takes a bite and immediately falls into a deep sleep.\n\nNarissa tries escaping with Giselle's body, but Edward thwarts her. Realizing that Narissa never cared about him, Nathaniel reveals her plot and apologizes for his previous actions. Robert realizes that true love's kiss is the only force powerful enough to break the apple's curse. Edward's kiss fails to wake Giselle, and the clock begins to chime, prompting Narissa to boast that Giselle will soon die. Edward realizes that Robert should kiss Giselle instead, but Robert is hesitant to do so until Nancy, despite being heartbroken, gives him her permission.\n\nRobert kisses Giselle right before the stroke of midnight, waking her up. Enraged, Narissa transforms into a dragon and takes Robert hostage, prompting Giselle to take Edward's sword and pursue her to the top of the building to rescue Robert. Pip comes to support Giselle and causes Narissa to fall to her death on the streets below. Robert almost falls as well, but Giselle rescues him, and they share another kiss.\n\nEdward and Nancy fall in love and get married in Andalasia. Nathaniel, who stays in New York, and Pip, who returns to Andalasia (where he regains his ability to speak), write autobiographies based on their experiences in the real world. Giselle starts a fashion design business, which becomes very successful, and forms a happy family with Robert and Morgan.",

        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nA group of singing \"zombies\" addresses the audience, setting the scene in the small town of Hatchetfield and introducing the eponymous \"Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals\", unremarkable everyman Paul Matthews (\"The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals\").\n\nPaul works at an office with his coworkers Bill, Charlotte, and Ted. Bill invites Paul to a production of Mamma Mia! at the local Starlight Theater, but Paul declines based on his distaste for musicals. He heads to the local coffee shop, Beanie's, to see Emma Perkins, a barista he has a crush on. As he leaves the shop, Paul is hounded by a Greenpeace advocate about donating to save the planet. During their argument, an approaching storm forces them to take shelter as an explosion can be heard.\n\nThe next day, Paul encounters a group of people singing and dancing led by the Greenpeace advocate from the day before (\"La Dee Dah Dah Day\"). Paul heads to work and Bill recounts that a strange meteor struck the Starlight Theater during the previous night's performance of Mamma Mia! . Their boss, Mr. Davidson, calls Paul into his office, where he sings an \"I Want\" song at him. (\"What Do You Want, Paul?\").  Paul rushes to Beanie's and tells Emma that he fears the world is becoming a musical. Emma, unconvinced, is called by her coworkers Nora and Zoey to perform their new Beanie's tip song (\"Cup of Roasted Coffee\"). Nora and Zoey continue singing and dancing after the song is supposed to end, and the shop's customers join the baristas in song after drinking coffee contaminated with a mysterious blue substance (\"Cup of Poisoned Coffee\"). Paul and Emma flee the shop and head into an alleyway where they find Paul's coworkers, who tell them that the entire town has started to behave the same way.\n\nCharlotte calls her husband Sam for help, but he has already been infected. Sam and two other police officers attack the group (\"Show Me Your Hands\") until Ted hits him over the head, knocking him out and exposing his brain, which is bright blue. Emma proposes that they seek help from her eccentric biology teacher Professor Hidgens. They follow her and take the unconscious Sam with them. The group arrives at Hidgens' fortified home on the edge of town. Hidgens believes that the behavior of the townsfolk is the result of an alien invasion brought to Earth by the meteor, and restrains Sam. Hidgens leads Paul, Emma, and Bill to get drinks, leaving Charlotte and Ted with Sam. They argue, and as Ted leaves, Sam wakes up. He convinces Charlotte to untie him with a love song (\"You Tied Up My Heart\"), then kills and infects her.\n\nMeanwhile, Emma and Paul grow closer, and they discover that Paul's hatred of musicals was inspired by seeing Emma perform in Brigadoon in high school. Emma tells Paul that she hates living in Hatchetfield and left after graduating high school, but returned due to the death of her sister . Their conversation is interrupted when Sam and Charlotte enter and attack the group (\"Join Us (And Die)\"). Hidgens shoots and kills them both with a shotgun. Bill receives a call from his daughter Alice, saying that she is trapped in the choir room at Hatchetfield High School. Paul goes with Bill to rescue her.\n\n### Act 2\n\nPaul and Bill search for Alice at Hatchetfield High. They find her and her girlfriend Deb already infected, and Alice tells Bill that she blames him for her death and has always resented him (\"Not Your Seed\"). The infected group kills Bill, then corners Paul, determined to make him suffer for his defiance. Before they can kill him, the Army arrives and fends off the group, before knocking Paul unconscious. Paul wakes up and is greeted by General John MacNamara, who leads a special unit of the US Army that deals with the strange and paranormal, called PEIP ( / \u02c8 p i\u02d0 p / PEEP ). MacNamara has been ordered to kill any survivors, but tells Paul that if he can rescue Emma, they are both welcome to join PEIP on the rescue helicopter.\n\nMeanwhile, at Hidgens' compound, Hidgens determines that the aliens are a hive mind that communicates through music. Emma theorizes that the meteor acts as the hive's central brain and that destroying it would end the invasion, but Hidgens has decided to embrace the hive's unity as a method to achieve world peace, and so sedates her to avoid her idea getting out. Emma wakes up tied to a chair alongside Ted as Hidgens deactivates his house's defences and reveals his hidden passion for musical theatre . Intending to draw the hive's attention, he performs the opening number of his self-penned musical Workin' Boys , glorifying his college undergrad experience (\u201cShow Stoppin' Number\u201d). The zombies arrive and join in the performance, and Hidgens, caught up in the song, believes them to be his old college friends, allowing them to disembowel and infect him.\n\nPaul arrives to rescue Emma and Ted and they head for the pickup site, but one of the infected attacks Paul. Ted abandons the others and continues to the pickup site alone. There he finds the army waiting, but is shot and assimilated by an infected General MacNamara (\"America Is Great Again\"). Paul and Emma manage to escape to the helicopter, but the pilot reveals herself to be Zoey, Emma's infected coworker. Zoey attempts to shoot them, but Paul kicks away the gun, causing the helicopter to crash and severely injure Emma. She tells Paul to leave her and destroy the meteor to end the invasion. Paul arms himself with grenades from the helicopter and leaves. Paul enters the collapsed Starlight Theater and is confronted by a group of the infected. They encourage Paul to express his feelings through song. His proximity to the meteor begins to infect him, and he fights for control over the musical virus, eventually managing to pull the pin on a grenade and throw it at the meteor (\"Let It Out\").\n\nTwo weeks later, Emma is recovering in a hospital in Clivesdale and is placed in witness protection with the help of PEIP. She is told there are no other survivors, but she will be escorted to her new life by someone she knows. Paul enters, and the two reunite, before Paul begins to sing, infected by the virus. He and the rest of the infected implore her to join the hive (\"Inevitable\"). As the cast take their bows at the end of the show, Emma realizes she is trapped on stage in a musical and cannot escape. She cries and begs the audience for help until the cast drag her backstage at the end of the curtain call.",

Pooh then looks in his cupboard to look for honey, only to find that his last honey pot is empty. He then hears a bee fly by and decides to climb a nearby honey tree, but he is unsuccessful. Unwilling to give up his quest for honey, Pooh visits the house of his best friend, a 7-year-old human boy named Christopher Robin , where he obtains a balloon from him.

After Pooh greedily helps himself to all of the honey in Rabbit's house, he begins to leave, only to realize that he has gotten too chubby to fit through the passageway that Rabbit uses as his front door. Unable to push Pooh's bottom through by himself, Rabbit rushes off to get help. Meanwhile, Owl tries to convince a gopher to dig Pooh out of the hole from the front, which is unsuccessful. Rabbit returns with Christopher Robin and they both try to pull Pooh out but fail; Christopher Robin decides Pooh must wait without food until he is thin enough to pass through Rabbit's front door, much to the consternation of both Pooh and Rabbit.\n\nTo cope with the situation, Rabbit attempts to decorate Pooh's bottom, while making sure that Pooh doesn't eat any food. After several days, Rabbit, who has become increasingly tired of the situation, leans against Pooh's bottom and feels him move slightly; he then joyously summons Christopher Robin and the rest of his friends to free Pooh. Rabbit pushes Pooh from inside, while everyone else pulls Pooh from outside, without success. Fed up with the delay, Rabbit takes several steps backwards and shoves Pooh with a running start, causing the bear to be launched into the air. He lands headfirst into the hole of another honey tree, scaring the bees away. Although his friends offer to free him again, Pooh does not mind being stuck again, as he can now eat all the honey he likes.",

        "synopsis": "Fifty years ago in the conformist planned community of Seabrook, an accident at the Seabrook Power Plant resulted in an explosion that caused half the population of Seabrook to turn into brain-eating, mindless zombies. Those that weren't affected constructed a wall to quarantine the zombies from the rest of Seabrook in a territory called Zombietown. The government later created bracelets for zombies, called Z-Bands, that deliver electromagnetic pulses to keep zombies from craving brains. In the present day, zombie students from Zombietown transfer to the human high school, Seabrook High, where suburban life is filled with uniformity, traditions, and pep rallies. The zombies in the school are patrolled by Dale, whose daughter Addison and nephew Bucky are on the school's cheerleading team.\n\nAddison begins a relationship with a zombie student named Zed, who is an exceptional player on the school's football team due to his Z-Band being hacked by Eliza, one of his zombie friends. Addison and Zed's relationship is initially unknown to all of the students and staff except two of Zed's zombie friends, Eliza and Bonzo. Bucky, who leads the cheerleading team, is jealous of Zed's popularity and makes sure Addison is not able to meet him. Addison is invited by Zed to attend the zombie party in Zombietown. She attends and has a private moment with Zed in the \"zombie park\". Just before the pair can kiss, however, the Zombie Patrol crashes the party and takes away Addison. At home, Dale and his wife Missy, the mayor of Seabrook, find out that she has a new crush and advise her not to do any cheering until they know who it is, not knowing that the crush is a zombie. The next day, Zed shows up on Addison's doorstep looking human. He and Addison leave her house and go on a date, where he admits he's been messing with his Z-band. Addison tells him that it is the others that have to change, not him.\n\nOn the day of the homecoming game, Bucky finds out about Zed's Z-Band hack and has his followers Stacey, Tracey, and Lacey steal Eliza's laptop to hack the Z-Bands. They succeed, resulting in Zed, Eliza, and Bonzo turning into \"full zombies\" and being taken away by the Zombie Patrol.\n\nMost of the cheerleaders, including Addison and Bree, show their sympathy for the zombies at the game. Addison calls out the crowd for seeing Zed and the other zombies as monsters, which led him to transform into a full zombie to win the game. She then rips off her wig exposing her naturally white hair, which she had hidden due to the residents of Seabrook being against anything different, angering her parents.\n\nBucky kicks out all of the zombie-supporting cheerleaders following the incident. When the cheerleader competition nears, Addison and Bree find Zed and Bonzo trying to stop Eliza from sabotaging the competition as revenge for Bucky's decision, after Eliza talks with her friends, she realizes that doing so is not the right thing to do. Bucky's team starts to fail because they do not have enough members, so Zoey, Zed's little sister, tries to get in and help him. At first, Zoey is booed by the crowd, but with help from Addison and Zed, the zombies and cheerleaders come together to make a cheer routine during the Cheer competition. Zed and Addison tell each other they love each other in Zombie-Tongue.\n\nThe zombies and humans reunite with each other via a block party in Zombietown.",

        "title": "Pipe Dream (musical)",
        "description": "Pipe Dream is the seventh musical by the team of Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II ; it premiered on Broadway on November 30, 1955. The work is based on John Steinbeck 's novel Sweet Thursday \u2014Steinbeck wrote the novel, a sequel to Cannery Row , in the hope of having it adapted into a musical. Set in Monterey, California , the musical tells the story of the romance between Doc, a marine biologist, and Suzy, who in the novel is a prostitute; her profession is only alluded to in the stage work. Pipe Dream was not an outright flop but was a financial disaster for Rodgers and Hammerstein .\n\nBroadway producers Cy Feuer and Ernie Martin held the rights to Sweet Thursday and wanted Frank Loesser to compose a musical based on it.  When Loesser proved unavailable, Feuer and Martin succeeded in interesting Rodgers and Hammerstein in the project. As Hammerstein adapted Sweet Thursday , he and Rodgers had concerns about featuring a prostitute as female lead and setting part of the musical in a bordello. They signed operatic diva Helen Traubel to play Fauna, the house madam .\n\nAs the show progressed through tryouts, Hammerstein repeatedly revised it, obscuring Suzy's profession and the nature of Fauna's house. Pipe Dream met with negative reviews and rapidly closed once it had exhausted its advance sale. It had no national tour or London production and has rarely been presented since. No movie version of the show was made; the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization (which licenses their works) once hoped for a film version featuring the Muppets , with Fauna played by Miss Piggy .",
        "synopsis": "The action of the play is in the mid-1950s, and takes place on Cannery Row in Monterey, California. In the Steinbeck book which forms the basis for the musical, the Bear Flag is a bordello and Suzy a prostitute. This is alluded to in the musical, but never expressed outright.\n\n### Act 1\n\nIn the early morning hours, marine biologist Doc is already at work in his one-man Western Biological Laboratory, getting an order of starfish ready to be shipped to a university. His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him (\"All Kinds of People\"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters from the next room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work (\"The Tide Pool\") and tells about her journey from San Francisco (\"Everybody's Got a Home but Me\"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Caf\u00e9\u2014an establishment open even at this hour\u2014had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in. Suzy is fully aware of what kind of a place it is.\n\nThe Palace Flophouse, where Mac, Hazel, and other locals reside, is a storage shed behind the Chinese store now owned by Joe the Mexican, and the Flophouse residents muse on their awkward path through life (\"A Lopsided Bus\"). Fauna comes by briefly to tell Hazel that she has run his \"horror scope\" and that he will one day be President. The Flophouse boys have a problem: Joe the Mexican acts unaware that he owns the shed; he has not appeared to either demand rent or to kick them out. They would like to know whether Joe is aware of his ownership, without tipping him off. The boys come up with the idea of raffling off their shed, with the raffle rigged so that Doc, who would not kick them out, will be the winner. The prize money will allow Doc to buy the microscope he needs for his scientific work. They sound out Joe about the scheme; he offers to sell tickets in his store and displays no awareness that he owns the shed.\n\nSuzy and Doc are attracted to each other; she has in fact been quietly tidying his rooms while he is down at the tide pool catching specimens (\"The Man I Used to Be\"). Fauna tries to persuade Doc, who is very successful with the ladies, to woo Suzy. When Doc is dismissive, Fauna explains that she wants to get Suzy out of the Bear Flag when it is taken over for the night by a private party. Doc agrees to take Suzy out and treat her like a lady. Fauna goes back to the Bear Flag (\"Sweet Thursday\"), and works to give Suzy confidence (\"Suzy is a Good Thing\"). Doc and Suzy's date is the source of great interest to the people of Cannery Row. Both are nervous; Doc wears an unaccustomed necktie, while Suzy tries to act like a lady, but her polish wears thin at times. (\"All At Once You Love Her\"). At the end of the meal, they decide to continue the evening on a secluded sand dune.\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe next morning, the girls of the Bear Flag are exhausted; the members of the private party wore them out. They wonder how Suzy's date with Doc went. Although it is only July, Fauna is busy ordering the Bear Flag's Christmas cards (\"The Happiest House on the Block\"). Suzy comes in and tells Fauna of the date; that Doc made no pass at her, and that Doc confided how lonely he is. She is convinced Doc \"don't need nobody like me\"; he needs a wife. Fauna is encouraging, but Suzy believes that Doc, knowing what he does of her history and work, will not want her. The Flophouse is to host a fancy dress party the following night, at which the raffle is to take place\u2014Fauna proposes that at the party, Suzy sing \"Will You Marry Me?\" to Doc. Suzy is still nervous; Fauna reminds her that the previous night, Doc did not treat her like a tramp, and she did not act like one. As word spreads of the celebration, the community becomes enthusiastic about the get-together (\"The Party That We're Gonna Have Tomorrow Night\")\n\nAt the Flophouse, a wild celebration takes place. Fauna, at first in the costume of a witch, seems to transform her costume into that of a Fairy Godmother. After some sleight of hand with the tickets, Doc wins the raffle, to the surprise of some. When Suzy comes out in a white bride's dress and sings her lines, Doc is unimpressed, and Suzy is humiliated. As both stalk off in opposite directions, the party disintegrates into a brawl.\n\nSuzy gets a job at a burger joint, and moves into an abandoned boiler, with entry through the attached pipe. Doc is unhappy, and Hazel decides something has to be done (\"Thinkin'\u2009\"). He is unable to come up with an answer, and eventually forgets the question. Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand (\"How Long?\"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical (\"The Next Time It Happens\").\n\nHazel sees Doc even more dispirited than before, and asks Suzy for an explanation. Suzy says that she is not willing to go over and be with Doc, but \"if he was sick or if he bust his leg or an arm or something\", she would go to him and bring him soup. The wheels in Hazel's head begin unaccustomed turnings, and sometime later when Mac passes Hazel on the street, Mac is surprised to see his friend carrying a baseball bat. When the scene returns to Doc's lab, he is receiving treatment from a real doctor and trying to puzzle out how he broke his arm. Suzy comes in, and makes soup for him as Hazel and Mac take turns watching at the keyhole. Doc admits that he needs and loves Suzy, and they embrace. As Fauna and the girls arrive, so do the other Flophouse boys, and Mac gives Doc what was bought with the raffle money\u2014the largest (tele)scope in the catalog. (\"Finale\")",

        "synopsis": "Act I\n\nThe cast of a musical version of William Shakespeare 's The Taming of the Shrew is rehearsing for the opening of the show that evening (\" Another Op'nin', Another Show \"). Egotistical Fred Graham is the director and producer and is starring as Petruchio ; his movie-star ex-wife, Lilli Vanessi, is playing Katherine . The two seem to be constantly arguing, and Lilli is particularly angry that Fred is pursuing the alluring young actress Lois Lane, who is playing Bianca . After the rehearsal, Lois's boyfriend Bill appears; he is playing Lucentio, but he missed the rehearsal because he was gambling. He tells her that he signed a $10,000 IOU in Fred's name, and Lois reprimands him (\" Why Can't You Behave? \").\n\nBefore the opening, Fred and Lilli meet backstage, and Lilli shows off her engagement ring from Washington insider General Harrison Howell, reminding Fred that it is the anniversary of their divorce. They recall the operetta in which they met, which included \"Wunderbar\", a Viennese waltz; they end up fondly reminiscing, singing and dancing. Two gangsters show up to collect the $10,000 IOU, and Fred replies that he never signed it; the gangsters obligingly say they will give him time to remember it and will return later. In her dressing room, Lilli receives flowers from Fred, and she declares that she is still \"So In Love\" with him. Fred tries to keep Lilli from reading the card that came with the flowers, which reveals that he really intended them for Lois. However, Lilli takes the card with her onstage, saying she will read it later.\n\nThe show begins (\"We Open in Venice\"). Baptista, Katherine and Bianca's father, will not allow his younger daughter Bianca to marry until his older daughter Katherine is married. However, she is shrewish and ill-tempered, and no man desires to marry her. Three suitors \u2013 Lucentio, Hortensio, and Gremio \u2013 try to woo Bianca, and she says that she would marry any of them (\" Tom, Dick, or Harry \"). Petruchio, a friend of Lucentio, expresses a desire to marry into wealth (\"I've Come to Wive it Wealthily in Padua\"). The suitors hatch a plan for him to marry Kate, as Baptista is rich. Kate, however, has no intentions of getting married (\"I Hate Men\"); Petruchio attempts to woo her (\"Were Thine That Special Face\"). Offstage, Lilli has an opportunity to read the card. She walks on stage off-cue and begins beating Fred, who, along with the other actors, tries to remain in character as Baptista gives Petruchio permission to marry Kate. Lilli continues to strike Fred, and he ends up spanking her onstage.\n\nOffstage, Lilli furiously declares she is leaving the show. However, the gangsters reappear, and Fred tells them that if Lilli quits, he'll have to close the show and won't be able to pay them the $10,000; the gangsters force her to stay at gunpoint. Back onstage, Bianca and Lucentio dance while the chorus performs \"We Sing of Love\", covering a scene change. The curtain opens, revealing the exterior of a church; Petruchio and Kate have just been married, and they exit the church; the gangsters, dressed in Shakespearean costume, are onstage to make sure that Lilli stays. Petruchio implores for Kate to kiss him, and she refuses. He lifts her over his shoulder and carries her offstage while she pummels his shoulder with her fists (\"Kiss Me Kate\").\n\nAct II\n\nDuring the show's intermission, the cast and crew relax in the alley behind the theater, lamenting that it's \" Too Darn Hot \" to meet their lovers that night. The play continues, as Petruchio tries to \"tame\" Katherine and mourns for his now-lost bachelor life (\"Where Is the Life That Late I Led?\"). Offstage, Lilli's fianc\u00e9 Harrison Howell is looking for her. He runs into Lois, and she recognizes him as a former lover but promises not to tell Lilli. Bill is shocked to overhear this, but Lois tells him that even if she is involved with other men, she is faithful to him in her own way (\" Always True to You in My Fashion \"). Lilli tries to explain to Howell that she is being forced to stay at the theatre by the gangsters, but Howell doesn't believe her and wants to discuss wedding plans. Fred insidiously points out how boring Lilli's life with Howell will be compared with the theatre. Bill sings a love song he has written for Lois (\"Bianca\").\n\nThe gangsters discover that their boss has been killed, so the IOU is no longer valid. Lilli leaves\u2014without Howell\u2014as Fred unsuccessfully tries to persuade her to stay (\"So in Love\" (Reprise)). The gangsters get caught on stage and improvise a comedic tribute to Shakespeare in which they explain that knowing Shakespeare is the key to romance (\"Brush Up Your Shakespeare\"). The company prepares for the conclusion of the play, the wedding of Bianca and Lucentio, even though they are now missing one of the main characters. However, just in time for Katherine's final speech, Lilli arrives onstage (\"I Am Ashamed That Women Are So Simple\"). Fred and Lilli wordlessly reconcile on stage, and the play ends (\"Kiss Me Kate\" (Finale)) with them, as well as Bill and Lois, kissing passionately.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nLucius Malfoy and Yaxley meet to discuss Lord Voldemort 's defeat at the hands of Harry Potter . Lucius describes that if it were not for Harry Potter, they would be reigning supreme. Lucius then explains his plan to use a Time Turner to go back in time to Harry's first year at Hogwarts to destroy him before he can become a threat for the Death Eaters (\"Not Over Yet\").\n\nIn the past, Harry Potter shows up at King's Cross station for his first year at Hogwarts and cannot seem to find Platform 9\u00be . He then meets the Weasleys, who help him find the way. In the midst of this, Harry meets Ron Weasley and the two quickly become the best of friends. Ron and the others at Platform 9\u00be discover who Harry is and begin to treat him like a celebrity. Harry asks Ron why they are acting this way toward him, and Ron tells Harry that he is \"The Boy Who Lived\", as he survived the Killing Curse and defeated Voldemort as a child. Rita Skeeter also tells Harry about the murderer Sirius Black , who betrayed his parents and is now after his life (\"Harry Freakin' Potter\").\n\nOn the Hogwarts Express , Harry and Ron meet Hermione Granger . Meanwhile, a Death Eater knocks out the candy lady and attempts to use the Killing Curse on Harry, but is disarmed by Remus Lupin , who is the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. As the train arrives at Hogwarts, Lupin tells Harry not to go looking for trouble. At this point, Harry is introduced to Severus Snape , who instantly takes a disliking to Harry, but Lupin stands up for Harry and Snape flees. Lupin leaves Harry after mentioning that his parents spent the best years of their lives at Hogwarts, leading Harry to believe he has finally found a home (\"To Have a Home\").\n\nAfter Harry, Ron, and Hermione are sorted by the Scarf of Sexual Preference (or \"Scarfy\") into \"Metrosexual\", \"Bi-curious\", and \"Waiting 'til marriage\", respectively, and by the Sorting Hat (or \"Sorty\") into Gryffindor house together, they meet Slytherin Draco Malfoy , who wants to be Harry's friend very badly, and tells his associates Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle to torture Ron and Hermione until he agrees. Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore arrives to cease the fighting and welcome everyone to Hogwarts. Dumbledore then introduces the House Cup and \"the silliest of all wizard sports\", Quidditch . Dumbledore introduces Lupin and Snape as the coaches of the Gryffindor and Slytherin Quidditch teams, respectively. As Snape begins to taunt Lupin about the full moon, Lupin begins to take on a werewolf transformation and runs away. Dumbledore then introduces the terrifying and musclebound professor Dolores Umbridge , who has been assigned by the Ministry of Magic to keep Harry and the rest of the school safe from Sirius Black. Snape escorts the boys to their dorm, and Dumbledore tells Harry he should be proud to be in Gryffindor, like himself and his parents were. Umbridge is left to instruct the girls on the rules of the dormitory, but intimidates them into submission.\n\nHarry and Ron go to try out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but before they can begin practicing, Snape shows up and he and Lupin argue over which team has the field reserved for the day. The two go to see Dumbledore to settle the matter. Meanwhile, Draco approaches Harry to boast about a picture he drew of him. Hermione attempts to stand up for Harry, but the tables are turned on her as everyone makes fun of her for not being able to draw (\"Hermione Can't Draw\"). Lupin returns to tell the team that he messed up the schedule, but no one seems to care as they are all having too much fun making fun of Hermione. Hermione wishes she could show everyone who she really is (\"The Coolest Girl\").\n\nThe students of Hogwarts are taking a field trip to Hogsmeade , but Harry does not have a signed permission form, so Umbridge decides to harshly punish him. Fortunately for Harry, Neville Longbottom shows up to give Umbridge flowers from \"Big D,\" which puts her in a much better mood. Harry is still not allowed to go, but he manages to escape Umbridge's wrath. Draco also does not have a permission form, so he stays behind to write a letter to his father. Harry meets up with Lupin, who gives him the Marauder's Map so that he can go secretly to Hogsmeade without a permission slip, but advises him not to go to the Shrieking Shack .\n\nUmbridge has become a lot less strict with rules after finding out she has a secret admirer, who is revealed to be Dumbledore. The two then begin a flirtatious relationship (\"Gettin' Along\"), and after sweeping \"Mr. Umbridge\" off her feet, Dumbledore spirits Umbridge away to make love. Meanwhile, the kids are swapping horrific stories about Sirius Black in Hogsmeade, which ends with Hermione being dared to go to the Shrieking Shack and draw a picture of the monster inside. The other kids are scared off by a werewolf howl. When Harry arrives, he convinces Ron that they must go in to save her. They manage to find her, but are then attacked by a werewolf. Harry fends it off by throwing Hermione's cat Crookshanks at it as bait. The group flees into the Forbidden Forest , where they each discuss their flaws, but because they are at Hogwarts, those flaws do not matter. Harry and Ron finally accept Hermione as their friend. Suddenly, the werewolf returns, but Firenze arrives to save the trio and brings them back to Hogwarts.\n\nWhile everyone is preparing for the Quidditch match, Neville and Rita Skeeter find Lupin half-naked and covered in blood in the woods with the body of a dead doe, which he claims is part of a pre-game ritual. Meanwhile, Dumbledore tells Snape of his evening with Umbridge, which quickly became a disaster when Dumbledore realized Umbridge was actually a woman. Contrary to this, Umbridge has become very clingy to Dumbledore, but when Snape and Dumbledore break the news to her, she goes back to being her old self, declaring that she will destroy Dumbledore and take his job as headmaster of Hogwarts. Lucius (from the future), arrives to meet with Snape, stating he has a lot riding on the Quidditch match, and replaces the majority of the Slytherin team with Death Eaters in order to kill Harry.\n\nThe Quidditch match finally begins (\"Let the Games Begin\"). At half-time, Hedwig shows up with a package for Harry, but Lucius intercepts it. Hermione manages to get it back by cursing Lucius. Lupin scolds the Gryffindor team for their sloppy playing, but Hermione arrives to give Harry his package, which turns out to be just what he needs: a Firebolt broomstick . Draco accidentally interferes with the Death Eaters' attempt on Harry's life and Harry manages to catch the Golden Snitch , winning the game for Gryffindor. Lucius is furious with Draco and crumples up the drawing Draco had made for him, disowning him.\n\nHermione prepares to leave Hogwarts for the holidays and gives Harry and Ron a scrapbook of their first semester at Hogwarts, including a newspaper clipping about Sirius Black that mentions Harry. Snape charges into the room screaming that Sirius Black has infiltrated Hogwarts. Harry becomes enraged after being reminded that Sirius was the man responsible for his parents' murder and decides to go find him using the Marauder's Map. The map leads Harry, Ron, and Hermione to a room containing a large mirror. As Harry approaches the mirror, he sees two mysterious figures in it. Sirius Black reveals himself and explains that it is the Mirror of Erised , which shows one's deepest desires. In the case of both Harry and Sirius, it shows Harry's parents. Sirius explains that he was framed for the murder of Harry's parents, so Harry and Sirius reconcile (\"Those Voices\"). Sirius then tells the trio that someone named \"Little D\" helped him escape from Azkaban prison and made his way to Hogwarts. Sirius also gives Harry his father 's Cloak of Invisibility as well as telling him that it was he who sent the Firebolt. Hermione sees someone coming on the Marauder's Map, so Sirius tries to throw the Invisibility Cloak over the trio, but Harry ends up putting it on Sirius. Snape arrives and begins taking his anger out on Harry, forcing Sirius to reveal himself. After the two trade insults about how Harry's mother chose James over Snape, Dumbledore and Umbridge show up. Umbridge tries to take Harry, Ron, and Hermione to Azkaban for helping Sirius get into Hogwarts, but Dumbledore tells her that it was he who helped Sirius get in. Umbridge then presents an ultimatum: \"Either kiss the dementors, or kiss Umbridge\". Desperate, Dumbledore Disapparates with Scarfy, leaving Umbridge to take over Hogwarts. As she corrals Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Sirius away, Snape looks in the Mirror of Erised and sees Lily .\n\n### Act II\n\nEveryone is shaken up by all the new regulations instated by Umbridge, including cancelling the Valentine's Day Dance, removing the moving paintings, and having the Ghostbusters chase away all the ghosts in the school, as well as put strict regulations on what the professors are allowed to teach. Lupin tries to cheer everyone up by teaching them a spell to ward off Dementors , called the Patronus Charm . Umbridge interrupts the lesson and fires Lupin due to not following the proper curriculum or even the assigned textbook (to which Lupin replies \"That textbook is like a thousand years old! It still refers to dementors as ringwraiths .\") Lupin leaves, much to Snape's delight, but apologizes to him for making fun of him when they were children. Umbridge takes the position of Professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts, and introduces \"Mama's Little Love Hand\", which she threatens them with. Hermione tries to stand up to Umbridge, but Umbridge sees her as herself at her age and promises to mold her in her image, starting by punishing her first. The whole class then stands up for Hermione and Snape decides to step in and take them to Potions class. Umbridge gives up but gives the class detention. She then asks Harry where Dumbledore is hiding, but Harry tells her that even if he did know he wouldn't tell her.\n\nUmbridge is having a good time teasing the Sorting Hat and replacing Dumbledore's Zac Efron poster with one of Taylor Lautner, but still has her doubts about being liked. She is then visited by the spirit of her dead mother who whips Umbridge into shape, and convinces her to kill the students of Hogwarts. Umbridge calls Snape to her office to ask him to kill Harry for her. Lucius also arrives and suggests that he and Umbridge team up to capture Dumbledore and kill Harry. Snape threatens to report their planning to the Ministry of Magic, but Lucius convinces him otherwise by showing Snape his memories of James and Lily Potter using the Pensieve to show him the type of people the Potters really are (\"Guys Like Potter\").\n\nThe students read in The Daily Prophet that Sirius has been sentenced to death, and Umbridge will now have Dementors surrounding Hogwarts full-time. While most of the first years are ordered to clean the Owlery, Harry is asked to come to Umbridge's office alone. When Harry arrives, Lucius appears from the shadows and attacks him. As the others are cleaning, Ron assures Hermione that she is nothing like Umbridge (using Spider-Man as an analogy like in the first show), and hints that he may have a crush on her. They are interrupted by a message from \"Little D,\" who wants to meet them in order to save Harry. \"Little D\" is revealed to be Draco, but this Draco is from the future like Lucius. Draco explains that Lucius came back in time to kill Harry and that he, Draco, was actually the one behind helping Sirius escape from Azkaban and having Firenze save Harry and company from the werewolf. Harry wakes up to find Lucius and the Death Eaters preparing to torture him and that Lucius and Umbridge have formed an alliance. Ron, Hermione, and Draco enter the room disguised as Death Eaters and manage to free Harry. Lucius grabs Draco, but Snape enters and saves them, allowing the children to escape.\n\nHarry and company free Sirius and Lupin returns to help. Lupin and Sirius explain that their and James' supposedly deceased friend Peter Pettigrew , who was disguised as a nearby Taylor Lautner poster, was actually behind the crimes Sirius was accused of. Ron tricks Pettigrew by offering him a Red Vine and the group captures him. As the group prepares to head to the Ministry of Magic to turn Pettigrew in, Lupin sees the full moon and becomes a werewolf. Pettigrew uses this as a distraction to get away. Lupin attacks Sirius, but suddenly, werewolf calls emanate from the Forbidden Forest, causing Lupin to chase after them. As the kids tend to Sirius, Umbridge appears, determined to finally punish them. Dumbledore returns and stands up to Umbridge, announcing that he is gay and will use force if necessary to end her reign of terror. Umbridge is too strong, however, and refuses to back down (\"Stutter\"). Harry tries to save Sirius from the Dementors, but passes out.\n\nDumbledore manages to get the kids out of danger, but tells them to stay put while he goes to search for help. Harry and the others feel all is hopeless, but Draco remembers that he has Lucius' Time Turner, which the group uses to travel back in time one hour. Harry meets up with the past Snape and inspires him to save Harry and friends later on during the fight with Lucius. Ron is still discouraged of their chances for victory, but Harry boosts the group's morale by convincing them that there is a way (\"No Way\"). Harry and the others run into Lucius, but Draco stands up to him at last and recruits Yaxley to their side. Lucius, however, shocks Draco with a horrible secret: he is not his real father. Years ago, his wife had an affair with their house-elf, Dobby, which resulted in Draco's birth. Lucius gets free and tortures Hermione, making her howl in pain. Before he is able to kill her, Lupin shows up in his werewolf form and kills him.\n\nHarry and the others then arrive at the scene of Umbridge and her dementors just as Dumbledore disapparates with their past selves. They each use the Patronus Charm to scare off the Dementors. Harry is about to take Umbridge down when she grabs hold of him. Firenze arrives just in time to save him and fights an epic battle with Umbridge, which ends with Firenze falling in love with Umbridge's brute incredible strength and taking her as a mate to save the dying race of centaurs .\n\nHarry, Lupin, and the others provide evidence to clear Sirius' name. Sirius and Lupin, both jobless and homeless, decide to travel the world together. The rest of the people at Hogwarts decide to have a huge party to celebrate (\"Hermione Can't Draw (Reprise)\"). The future Draco tells Hermione he is not going with as he could run into his past self, causing a temporal paradox . Before he leaves, he confesses his love for Hermione, but she shoots him down. However, Draco meets Luna Lovegood , and the two bond over Pigfarts, the wizarding school on Mars. In Dumbledore's office, the Sorting Hat and Scarfy are reunited and they both decide to get married. Harry visits Dumbledore and the two discuss that their days away from Hogwarts are what make the time they have there so precious. Harry and the others all say goodbye for the summer, knowing that there will always be a way back. (\"Days of Summer\"/\"Goin' Back to Hogwarts\").",

        "title": "Grease (musical)",
        "description": "Grease is a 1971 musical with music, lyrics, and a book by Jim Jacobs and Warren Casey . Named after the 1950s United States working-class youth subculture known as greasers and set in 1959 at the fictional Rydell High School in Northwest Chicago (based on Taft High School in Chicago, Illinois, and named after rock singer Bobby Rydell ), the musical follows ten working-class teenagers as they navigate the complexities of peer pressure, politics, personal core values, and love.\n\nThe score borrows heavily from the sounds of early rock and roll . In its original production in Chicago, Grease was a raunchy, raw, aggressive, vulgar show. Subsequent productions toned down the more risqu\u00e9 content. The show mentions social issues such as teenage pregnancy , peer pressure , and gang violence ; its themes include love, friendship, teenage rebellion , sexual exploration during adolescence. Jacobs described the show's basic plot as a subversion of common tropes of 1950s cinema, since the female lead, who in many 1950s films transformed the alpha male into a more sensitive and sympathetic character, is instead drawn into the man's influence and transforms into his wild, roguish fantasy.\n\nSince it was first performed on February 5, 1971, at Kingston Mines nightclub in Chicago, Grease has been successful on both stage and screen, but the content has been diluted and its teenage characters have become less Chicago habitu\u00e9s (the characters' Polish-American backgrounds in particular are ignored with last names often changed, although two Italian-American characters are left identifiably ethnic) and more generic. The first Broadway production opened on June 7, 1972; when it closed in 1980, Grease ' s 3,388-performance run was the longest yet in Broadway history , although it was surpassed by A Chorus Line on September 29, 1983. It went on to become a West End hit, a successful feature film , two popular Broadway revivals in 1994 and 2007, and a staple of regional theatre , summer stock , community theatre , and high school and middle school drama groups. It remains Broadway's 18th longest-running show .\n\nGrease was adapted in 1978 as a feature film , which starred John Travolta (who himself had been in stage productions in a different role) and British-Australian singer and actress Olivia Newton-John , removed the musical's Chicago urban setting, and changed some plot elements, characters, and songs while adding new songs and elaborating on some plot elements only alluded to in the musical. Some of these revisions have been incorporated into revivals of the musical. A 2016 live TV musical used elements from both the original stage version and the film. A 1982 film sequel, Grease 2 , included only a few supporting characters from the film and musical and had no involvement from Jacobs or Casey; Jacobs has gone on record to voice his disapproval of Grease 2 .",
        "synopsis": "Because of changes to the musical that have been made since the 1978 film adaptation, several variants exist. In the event two songs are listed at any given point, the first is from the 1972 Off-Broadway version, and the second is from revivals that use the film music, such as the 2007 version. [ citation needed ]\n\n### Act I\n\nAt revivals that use the 1978 song \" Grease \", it is typically inserted at or near the beginning of the show.\n\nAt the Rydell High Class of 1959 reunion (\"Alma Mater\"), old maid English teacher Miss Lynch introduces former cheerleader/yearbook-editor Patty Simcox Honeywell and class valedictorian Eugene Florczyk. Eugene gives a rousing speech, mentioning that the alumni who are missing from the reunion are surely present in spirit. The scene segues to bring in the greaser gang known as the Burger Palace Boys (known in later versions as the \"T-Birds\") and their auxiliary, the \"Pink Ladies\", as they sing a cruder version of the Rydell alma mater (\"Alma Mater (Parody)\").\n\nFlashing back to the first day of high school in fall 1958, the Pink Ladies sit in the lunchroom, and the Burger Palace Boys sit at the entrance to the school. One of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy, introduces her new neighbor Sandy Dumbrowski, who had been unjustly rejected from a Catholic school , to the others (Marty, Jan and Rizzo), as well as Patty. Sandy tells of how she had a brief love affair the summer before, which ended with unresolved love. Meanwhile, womanizing greaser Danny Zuko is telling the Burger Palace Boys (Kenickie, Roger, Doody and Sonny) the story of his own summer fling (\" Summer Nights \"). The Pink Ladies soon after realize that Sandy's summer fling was the same Danny Zuko that attends Rydell High and arrange for the two to bump into each other at school; the resulting meeting is tense and awkward, as Danny had previously told Sandy that he attended Lake Forest Academy and does not want to admit to the Burger Palace Boys that she was the woman he was talking about. As the Burger Palace Boys leave, Sandy is hurt and angry, but the Pink Ladies cheer her up, by inviting her over to Marty's pajama party.\n\nShortly afterwards, the teenagers gather in the hall as Doody shows off his new guitar and performs a song (\"Those Magic Changes\").\n\nAt Marty's pajama party, the girls experiment with wine, cigarettes, pierce their ears and talk about boys. The sheltered Sandy goes into shock and falls ill from seeing blood when the Pink Ladies try to pierce her ears, leading them to mock her when she's not in the room (in some revivals, the song \"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\" is placed here, mirroring the film). Marty tells about her long-distance courtship with a Marine named Freddy and it is implied that she maintains it only because of the lavish gifts he sends her from Japan (\"Freddy, My Love\").\n\nThat same night, the Burger Palace Boys are busy stealing hubcaps, unaware that the hubcaps are on Kenickie's car, Greased Lightnin'. Unfazed by the others' skepticism, Kenickie sings of the upgrades needed to make the car a racing-worthy chick magnet (\" Greased Lightnin' \").\n\nDanny sees Sandy again at her cheerleader practice, and tries to apologize for his behavior. Patty interrupts and flirts with Danny. Patty informs Danny that track try-outs are nearing, and Danny tells Sandy that he will join the track team to prove himself; he leaves as Patty and Sandy practice cheering (\"Rydell Fight Song\").\n\nAs the Burger Palace Boys and Pink Ladies gather at the park, Danny reveals to the rest of the greasers that he has joined the track team, much to their dismay and skepticism. After Roger and Jan bicker about food, drink, and religion, Jan asks him how he earned the nickname Rump; he explains that, as \"King of the Mooners\", he has a hobby of baring his backside to unsuspecting victims, and in the process, both reveal their affections for each other (\"Mooning\"). Rizzo teases Danny for falling for a girl who resembles the excessively proper teenage ing\u00e9nue , Sandra Dee , and the other greasers join in as she makes fun of Sandy, who has not arrived at the picnic yet (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\").\n\nSandy, working on a biology assignment with Eugene, comes in just as the greasers finish making fun of her. She attacks Rizzo in a fit of rage and erroneously assumes Danny is the one behind the mockery. Furious, she tells Danny that she wishes she never met him and storms out of the picnic. Danny shrugs off Sandy's negative response, and the greasers pair off for the upcoming sock hop . Danny teases Marty for not having a date (recommending Eugene), and the greasers all laugh (\"We Go Together\").\n\nFor revivals that use \" Hopelessly Devoted to You \", the exact placement varies. It sometimes replaces the first rendition of \"We Go Together\" and in other examples, such as the 2007 revival, it is placed early in Act II.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe night of the sock hop arrives (\"Shakin' At the High School Hop\"). Sandy is at home by herself, listening to the radio and crying over how much she misses Danny (\"It's Raining on Prom Night\").\n\nMeanwhile, Kenickie comes into the dance with his date, Cha-Cha DiGregorio, a girl from Saint Bernadette's Academy. Patty tries to pair up with Danny, trash-talking Sandy's cheerleading skills in the process, but is unable to get out of her promise to dance with Eugene despite Rizzo trying to seduce Eugene as a distraction. Kenickie ends up paired off with Rizzo, and Danny with Cha-Cha. The MC Vince Fontaine, a radio disc jockey , begins the hand jive dance contest, and everyone eagerly participates as he tags the contestants out (\"Born to Hand Jive\"). In the end, Danny and Cha-Cha are the winners. Amongst the awards given to the couple, Danny receives two free drive-in movie tickets.\n\nSometime later outside of the Burger Palace hangout, Kenickie, Doody, and Sonny run into Frenchy. The boys are armed with an \"arsenal\" of household items and reveal that, to their surprise, Cha-Cha was the girlfriend of someone in the boys' rival gang, the Flaming Dukes; the Dukes, hearing of Cha-Cha's dancing with the Burger Palace Boys, challenged the boys to a rumble . Danny sprints into the scene wearing his track suit, to the disbelief of the other boys. Danny tells the boys he cannot partake in the rumble because of a track meet and sprints off.\n\nThe three remaining boys go into the Burger Palace for a snack before the fight, and Frenchy laments at what to do with her life, having dropped out of beauty school in frustration at failing all of her classes. The heavenly Teen Angel appears with a chorus of back-up singing angels and tells her to return to high school (\" Beauty School Dropout \").\n\nThe three boys exit the Burger Palace, bemoaning Danny's betrayal while only halfheartedly noticing Roger is unaccounted for. They wait for the Flaming Dukes, but the rival gang never turns up. Roger finally turns up with only a broken antenna as a weapon; in response, the other three proceed to strip Roger of his pants and shoes.\n\nAt the drive-in, Danny tries to make up for his behavior and offers Sandy his class ring. She initially is thrilled, but pulls back and exits the car when he tries to move beyond a kiss. Danny laments his loneliness (\"Alone at a Drive-In Movie\" or \"Sandy\").\n\nSeveral days later, Sandy and the greasers \u2014 without Danny \u2014 are gathered in Jan's basement (\"Rock 'N' Roll Party Queen\"). Rizzo, who missed her period, fears she is pregnant and tells Marty (who herself laments that Vince tried to spike her drink at the dance) that the father is a stranger who had sex with her with a cheap, broken condom; word gets back to everyone else. The boys offer support as they leave; Rizzo rejects it, leading Sandy to ask her why and presume that Kenickie is the father. Rizzo responds by saying that she is a better person than others make her out to be and that showing weakness is the worst thing she knows (\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\"). Rizzo leaves, and Sandy decides what she needs to do to fit in with the greasers (\"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\" (Reprise)).\n\nThe next day, the boys are hanging out at the Burger Palace. A dejected Patty reveals Danny, who follows her in, has reverted to his old ways and quit the track team. Sandy comes in alongside the Pink Ladies, having transformed herself from an innocent schoolgirl into a greaser's fantasy, punching out a dismayed Patty. Danny is delighted at this change and the couple express their mutual feelings for each other (\"All Choked Up\" or \"You're the One That I Want\").\n\nAfterwards, the greasers prepare to head to Roger's to watch The Mickey Mouse Club , inviting Patty along. Frenchy takes a job as a makeup saleswoman at Woolworth's , Rizzo reveals that she is not pregnant, and she and Kenickie reunite. All ends happily, and the Burger Palace Boys, the Pink Ladies, Sandy, and Patty sing about how they will always be friends to the end (\"We Go Together\" (Reprise)).\n\n### Revival changes\n\nBecause of the popularity of the 1978 film adaptation , which made several changes to the musical's songs and themes (many to accommodate its casting choice of the singer Olivia Newton-John as Sandy), the subsequent revivals adopted several of the changes made in the film, particularly the replacement of several songs, Sandy's portrayal with blonde hair instead of the original brunette, and the renaming of the Burger Palace Boys to their film name, the T-Birds. However, in the revival, the role of Sandy Dumbrowski is not changed from the original Broadway production.\n\n### School version\n\nIn order to make the original musical suitable for young performers and audiences, Jim Jacobs decided to write a \"school version\" of the musical. This edition eliminates all of the references to cigarettes and alcohol, and also any swearing or bad language. Most of the songs have also undergone changes as well; the numbers are all shortened greatly and edited for content/language. Some plot lines are missing from the school version, such as Rizzo's pregnancy and her song \"There Are Worse Things I Could Do.\" This section is entirely cut from the script and score. The beginning of the pajama party in Marty's bedroom is also cut. (In this version, the Pink Ladies do not offer Sandy cigarettes or wine. Instead it begins directly with piercing her ears.) Overall, this version is considered to be G-rated .\n\nIn addition to the removal of \"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\", the following songs of the School Version have undergone lyric changes:\n\nThe remainder of the songs have been greatly edited for time, deleting several verses from the original songs.\n\nA version of the play is available that keeps some of the adult references and innuendo but excises some of the more explicit lyrics.",
        "cast": "A number of characters in the musical are not seen : Freddy Strulka, Marty's boyfriend and a member of the United States Marine Corps who showers Marty with lavish gifts from Japan; the coach of the track team; the Flaming Dukes, an adversary of the Burger Palace Boys who never show up to a threatened rumble; and Mr. Drucker, a perverted economics teacher who has made passes at the Pink Ladies. In the film, the Flaming Dukes are renamed the Scorpions and have an on-screen role, as does the track coach (who is surnamed Calhoun and is portrayed by Sid Caesar ).\n\n### Notable cast members\n\n### Notable cast replacements\n\nSource:",

        "description": "Frozen is a musical with music and lyrics by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez , and book by Jennifer Lee , based on the Walt Disney Animation Studios ' 2013 animated film Frozen . The story centers on the relationship between two sisters who are princesses, Elsa and Anna . Elsa has magical powers to create snow and ice, which she does not know how to control. After inheriting the throne, Elsa flees, inadvertently causes the kingdom to become frozen in an eternal winter, and nearly kills her sister. She must sacrifice and show true love to save the day.\n\nProduced by Disney Theatrical Productions , the musical had a tryout at the Buell Theatre in Denver , Colorado in August 2017 and premiered on Broadway in March 2018 at the St. James Theatre to mixed reviews.

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nA Greek chorus introduces Princess Elsa of Arendelle, and her playful younger sister, Princess Anna (\"Vuelie\", \"Let the Sun Shine On\"). While the family knows about Elsa's magic, it is kept a secret from the people of Arendelle. One night at bedtime, Elsa and Anna build a magical snowman and name it Olaf (\"A Little Bit of You\"); Elsa creates snow in their room. In their excitement, Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her icy magic. Their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, call for the aid of the colony of hidden folk , led by Grand Pabbie (\"Hidden Folk\"). He heals Anna and removes her memories of Elsa's magic. Elsa asks Grand Pabbie to remove her magic, but he says that it is a part of her. He gives her a vision of her future, frightening Elsa, who believes that her magic will cause death. The King isolates the sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts Anna out when Anna seeks to play (\" Do You Want to Build a Snowman? \"), and Elsa's fear of her powers grows. While the princesses are still young, the Queen and King sail to seek a solution to help Elsa control her powers, and they die at sea during a storm.\n\nYears pass. The day before Elsa's coronation as Queen of Arendelle, Anna asks if there is anything she can do for her sister. Elsa, her room coated in ice, refuses to open her door out of fear of hurting Anna again. Anna is excited for the castle's gates to open (\" For the First Time in Forever \") and meets the handsome Prince Hans (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\"). Although the people rejoice at the prospect of a new monarch (\"Queen Anointed\"), Elsa is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her, while wishing to be able to reconnect with Anna (\"Dangerous to Dream\"). Elsa's coronation goes smoothly, and she initiates her first contact with Anna in years. They enjoy the coronation together, with Anna talking the Duke of Weselton out of dancing with the newly crowned Queen. However, Elsa leaves after Anna asks about keeping the gates open. Anna falls in love with Hans (\" Love Is an Open Door \"), who quickly proposes marriage to her, and the two share a kiss after she accepts. The couple asks for Elsa's blessing, who objects because the two have only known each other for a day.  After intense questioning from Anna about shutting her out of her life, Elsa accidentally unleashes her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees to the North Mountain without realizing that her suppressed magic has engulfed Arendelle in an eternal winter.\n\nAnna goes in search of Elsa, leaving Hans in charge of the kingdom during her absence. Up in the mountains, ice harvester Kristoff and his reindeer Sven (\" Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People \") are found by the ill-equipped Anna, still in her coronation dress. She orders Kristoff to take her to the North Mountain, the source of the storm. Kristoff gives her a set of winter clothes, and she leaves her dress behind. In view of her sudden engagement, Kristoff and Anna disagree about love as they cross a bridge (\"What Do You Know About Love\"), and Anna saves Kristoff from falling off the bridge. Anna and Kristoff then encounter a newly created Olaf, who offers to guide them to Elsa and sings about his love for summer (\" In Summer \"). A soldier arrives in Arendelle with Anna's dress, and Hans fears for Anna's safety. He assembles a search party (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise)), including the Duke and two of his men, who intend to put her in her place. Meanwhile, on the North Mountain, Elsa builds an ice castle with her powers and transforms her coronation dress into a sparkly ice gown (\" Let It Go \").\n\n### Act II\n\nAnna, Kristoff, and Olaf arrive at Wandering Oaken's Trading Post & Sauna to meet the owner, Oaken (\"Hygge\"). Anna enjoys the sauna together with its many other patrons. Kristoff convinces Oaken and his patrons to aid their journey; Oaken gives them provisions and a winter dress for Anna.\n\nReaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa (\"I Can't Lose You\"), but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes angry and frustrated, saying that she cannot fix it, and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart. Out of fear of hurting Anna further, Elsa forces her, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf out of the palace. Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the hidden folk, his adoptive family, who recognize Anna as the princess and attempt to match her with Kristoff, despite him mentioning her betrothal to Hans (\" Fixer Upper \"). After Anna collapses, Grand Pabbie attempts to remove the magic freezing her heart but fails; Kristoff realizes that he is falling in love with her (\"Kristoff Lullaby\"). Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless \"an act of true love\" reverses the spell. Kristoff selflessly races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss .\n\nIn the ice castle, Elsa considers whether she is a monster and wonders how can she end the storm, unsure whether the storm would end or grow worse if she were to die (\" Monster \"). She resolves to stay alive to end the storm and lowers the defenses around the castle, allowing Hans and his men to capture her. Home, Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, he reveals that he has been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by allowing Anna to freeze to death and accusing Elsa of her murder (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise 2)). Hans locks Anna in a room to die, as Anna reflects on her mistakes while still holding on to the idea of love (\"True Love\"). Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the blizzard outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her.\n\nHans publicly charges Elsa with treason and sentences her to death. Elsa escapes her chains and flees outside as a blizzard grows (\"Colder by the Minute\"). Kristoff and Anna struggle to find each other. Hans confronts Elsa, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down and the storm to pause. Anna finally finds Kristoff but spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa mourns her sister, who thaws out, her sacrifice constituting \"an act of true love\". Realizing that her magic is controlled by love, Elsa ends the winter (\"Vuelie (Love Thaws)\"). Anna punches Hans, and she and Kristoff become a couple, with Elsa's blessing. Elsa and Anna reunite without fear for the first time, as their parents, young Elsa and young Anna appear in the background, signaling the healing of the sisters' painful past (Finale).",

        "description": "Something Rotten! is a musical comedy with a book by John O'Farrell and Karey Kirkpatrick and music and lyrics by Karey and Wayne Kirkpatrick . Set in 1595, the story follows the Bottom brothers, Nick and Nigel, who struggle to find success in the theatrical world as they compete with the wild popularity of their contemporary William Shakespeare .\n\nSomething Rotten! opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre on April 22, 2015, where it played for 708 performances. It was nominated for ten Tony Awards , including Best Musical , and won one for Best Featured Actor in a Musical ( Christian Borle ). Tours and international productions have followed.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe Minstrel welcomes everyone (\"Welcome to the Renaissance \"). Nick Bottom runs a theatre troupe with his brother Nigel. They are rehearsing their upcoming play, Richard II , when Lord Clapham, a patron of the troupe, announces that Shakespeare is doing Richard II . The news outrages Nick, as Shakespeare has already done Richard III , and the thought of going backwards seems absurd to him. Lord Clapham tells the brothers he is stopping their funds unless they have another play by the next morning, sending Nick into a rant: \"God, I Hate Shakespeare\".\n\nOn the way home, Nick encounters Shylock the Jew who wants to help fund the troupe, but Nick rejects this as it is illegal to employ a Jew. Nick and his wife Bea are saving for a better life, and when Nick tries to open the Money Box, Bea pulls it away, instead offering to help them by working, but Nick is adamant (\"Right Hand Man\"). Despite Nick's arguments, Bea goes out to do jobs that Nick claims are for men. Nick reveals that he hates Shakespeare because he is jealous of Shakespeare's success (\"God, I Hate Shakespeare\" (reprise)). He seeks a way to top Shakespeare and steals from the Money Box to see a soothsayer named Thomas Nostradamus (the nephew of Nostradamus ). Nick asks him what the next big thing in theatre will be, and Nostradamus says that it will be \"a musical\", where the speaking stops, and the story is told through songs. Nick finds this ridiculous but quickly warms up to the idea (\"A Musical\").\n\nNigel has just met Portia, the daughter of Brother Jeremiah, and they immediately fall in love. Nick tells him that he shouldn't pursue her because she is a Puritan . Nick soon tells Nigel about the musical idea but does not tell him about seeing Nostradamus. Nigel wants to musicalize \"The Brothers from Cornwall\", the story of how they came to England, but Nick says it has to be bigger and decides to adapt the Black Death . The troupe performs a song for Lord Clapham (\"The Black Death\"). Lord Clapham is disgusted and deserts the troupe, and Brother Jeremiah threatens to have Nick executed if he continues with his work.\n\nNigel tries to write a new play. Portia sneaks out to see him; they discover that they both love poetry (\"I Love the Way\"). Nigel tells Portia he sent one of his sonnets to Shakespeare for feedback. A messenger arrives with an invitation for Nigel to attend Shakespeare in the Park and an after-party. Nigel takes Portia as his \"plus one\", and they watch Shakespeare perform (\"Will Power\").\n\nBea tells Nick she's pregnant, and he is ecstatic, yet also worried. Shylock also has an invitation to the after-party and tells Nick that Nigel is attending it. Furious at Nigel, Nick goes to the party to tell him off. There, Portia gets drunk, and Shakespeare asks to read Nigel's journal of poems and writings. Nick chastises Shakespeare for trying to steal Nigel's ideas and reprimands Nigel for his naivet\u00e9. Brother Jeremiah arrives to find a drunk Portia and once again admonishes Nigel. Desperate and out of options, Nick agrees to let Shylock invest in his play.\n\nNick goes back to Nostradamus with the remaining money from the Money Box to ask what Shakespeare's new hit is going to be. Nostradamus sees Hamlet but misinterprets it as \"Omelette\" and sees the protagonist eating a danish pastry rather than being a Danish prince. Nick dreams of a future in which crowds cheer for him and Shakespeare bows down to him (\"Bottom's Gonna Be on Top\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe Minstrel notes the stresses that the Bottom brothers and Shakespeare face (\"Welcome to the Renaissance\" (reprise)). Shakespeare laments of trying to write hits while managing his fame. A spy tells him that the brothers are trying to steal his upcoming hit. Shakespeare decides to disguise himself as \"Toby Belch\" and audition for the brothers' troupe to steal the play (\"Hard to Be the Bard\").\n\nThe troupe is rehearsing Omelette: The Musical (\"It's Eggs!\"). Shylock is their new investor, but they cannot find a title that would make his role legal. Some of the actors wonder why Nostradamus is at their theatre; Nick says that he is an actor. \"Toby Belch\" arrives and is hired. Shakespeare is surprised to learn that his next hit is supposed to be about eggs.\n\nNigel sneaks out to London Bridge to see Portia and reads her another poem about his love for her. Portia says that everyone will change their minds about their relationship when they hear Nigel's beautiful sonnets (\"We See the Light\"). Nigel is not happy with Omelette , believing it won't work. Brother Jeremiah interrupts the lovers and imprisons Portia in a tower for disobeying. Saddened, Nigel is inspired to write a different play that is revealed to be Hamlet . At the theatre, Nigel tells Nick about this, and Shakespeare realizes that this is his next hit and takes advantage of Nick and Nigel's argument to get it (\"To Thine Own Self\"). Nick is having qualms about Omelette as well but dismisses these doubts when he learns the musical is sold out. Shakespeare steals Nigel's hit under the guise of \"improving it\". Bea tells Nigel that they should trust Nick because they can always call on him if they need him (\"Right Hand Man\" (reprise)).\n\nNick and the troupe prepare for the show (\"Something Rotten!\"). It opens with a bombastic dance number filled with references to musicals such as The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera (\"Make an Omelette\"). Shakespeare removes his disguise and reveals Nick's plot, horrifying Nigel and the troupe.\n\nIn court, Nick, Nigel, Nostradamus, and Shylock are on trial and are about to be sentenced to beheading. Bea enters disguised as a lawyer and makes Nick confess that he stole from the Money Box; she tells the judge that beheading him would be redundant because he has already lost his head. She has made a deal with Shakespeare that they will be exiled to America (\"To Thine Own Self\" (reprise)). She says that they always wanted a new country house, and now they are getting a house in a new country. Portia then arrives, having escaped the tower. She renounces her father's ideals and joins the Bottoms in exile.\n\nThe Bottom Family, Portia, Shylock, Nostradamus and their acting troupe find new opportunities in the New World (\"Finale\"). When they hear about the opening of Shakespeare's new masterpiece, Hamlet , Nostradamus sighs, \"I was this close!\"",

        "description": "The Threepenny Opera ( Die Dreigroschenoper [di\u02d0 d\u0281a\u026a\u02c8\u0261\u0281\u0254\u0283n\u0329\u02cc\u0294o\u02d0p\u0250] ) is a 1928 German \"play with music\" by Bertolt Brecht , adapted from a translation by Elisabeth Hauptmann of John Gay's 18th-century English ballad opera , The Beggar's Opera , and four ballads by Fran\u00e7ois Villon , with music by Kurt Weill . Although there is debate as to how much contribution Hauptmann might have made to the libretto, Brecht is usually listed as sole author and Hauptmann as the sole translator, which was probably an unfair oversimplification typical of the time.\n\nThe work offers a socialist critique of the capitalist world. It opened on 31 August 1928 at Berlin's Theater am Schiffbauerdamm .\n\nWith influences from jazz and German dance music, songs from The Threepenny Opera have been widely covered and become standards , most notably \" Die Moritat von Mackie Messer \" (\"The Ballad of Mack the Knife \") and \" Seer\u00e4uberjenny \" (\" Pirate Jenny \").\n\nThe Threepenny Opera has been performed in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Russia, Italy, and Hungary. It has also been adapted to film and radio. The German-language version from 1928 entered the public domain in the United States in 2024 .",
        "synopsis": "### Overview\n\nSet in Victorian London, the play focuses on Macheath , an amoral antihero who leads a criminal gang, committing robbery, arson, rape and murder.\n\nMacheath (\"Mackie,\" or \"Mack the Knife\") marries Polly Peachum. This displeases her father, who controls the beggars of London, and he endeavours to have Macheath hanged. His attempts are hindered by the fact that the Chief of Police, Tiger Brown, is Macheath's old army comrade. Still, Peachum exerts his influence and eventually gets Macheath arrested and sentenced to hang . Macheath escapes this fate via a deus ex machina moments before the execution when, in an unrestrained parody of a happy ending, a messenger from the Queen arrives to pardon Macheath and grant him the title of baron. The details of the original 1928 text have often been substantially modified in later productions.\n\nA draft narration by Brecht for a concert performance begins: \"You are about to hear an opera for beggars. Since this opera was intended to be as splendid as only beggars can imagine, and yet cheap enough for beggars to be able to watch, it is called the Threepenny Opera .\"\n\n### Prologue\n\nA street singer entertains the crowd with the illustrated murder ballad or B\u00e4nkelsang , titled \"Die Moritat von Mackie Messer\" (\"Ballad of Mack the Knife\"). As the song concludes, a well-dressed man leaves the crowd and crosses the stage. This is Macheath, alias \"Mack the Knife\".\n\n### Act 1\n\nThe story begins in the shop of Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum, the boss of London's beggars, who outfits and trains the beggars in return for a slice of their takings from begging. In the first scene, the extent of Peachum's iniquity is immediately exposed. Filch, a new beggar, is obliged to bribe his way into the profession and agree to pay over to Peachum 50 percent of whatever he made; the previous day he had been severely beaten up for begging within the area of jurisdiction of Peachum's protection racket.\n\nAfter finishing with the new man, Peachum becomes aware that his grown daughter Polly did not return home the previous night. Peachum, who sees his daughter as his own private property, concludes that she has become involved with Macheath. This does not suit Peachum at all, and he becomes determined to thwart this relationship and destroy Macheath.\n\nThe scene shifts to an empty stable where Macheath himself is preparing to marry Polly once his gang has stolen and brought all the necessary food and furnishings. No vows are exchanged, but Polly is satisfied, and everyone sits down to a banquet. Since none of the gang members can provide fitting entertainment, Polly gets up and sings \" Seer\u00e4uberjenny \", a revenge fantasy in which she is a scullery maid turning pirate queen to order the execution of her bosses and customers. The gang becomes nervous when the Chief of Police, Tiger Brown, arrives, but it's all part of the act; Brown had served with Mack in England's colonial wars and had intervened on numerous occasions to prevent the arrest of Macheath over the years. The old friends duet in the \"Kanonen-Song\" (\"Cannon Song\" or \"Army Song\"). In the next scene, Polly returns home and defiantly announces that she has married Macheath by singing the \"Barbarasong\" (\"Barbara Song\"). She stands fast against her parents' anger, but she inadvertently reveals Brown's connections to Macheath which her parents subsequently use to their advantage.\n\n### Act 2\n\nPolly warns Macheath that her father will try to have him arrested. He is finally convinced that Peachum has enough influence to do it and makes arrangements to leave London, explaining the details of his bandit \"business\" to Polly so she can manage it in his absence. Before he leaves town, he stops at his favorite brothel, where he sees his ex-lover, Jenny. They sing the \"Zuh\u00e4lterballade\" (\"Pimp's Ballad\", one of the Villon songs translated by Ammer) about their days together, but Macheath doesn't know Mrs Peachum has bribed Jenny to turn him in. Despite Brown's apologies, there's nothing he can do, and Macheath is dragged away to jail. After he sings the \"Ballade vom angenehmen Leben\" (\"Ballad of the Pleasant Life\"), another Villon/Ammer song, another girlfriend, Lucy (Brown's daughter) and Polly show up at the same time, setting the stage for a nasty argument that builds to the \"Eifersuchtsduett\" (\"Jealousy Duet\"). After Polly leaves, Lucy engineers Macheath's escape. When Mr Peachum finds out, he confronts Brown and threatens him, telling him that he will unleash all of his beggars during Queen Victoria 's coronation parade, ruining the ceremony and costing Brown his job.\n\n### Act 3\n\nJenny comes to the Peachums' shop to demand her money for the betrayal of Macheath, which Mrs Peachum refuses to pay. Jenny reveals that Macheath is at Suky Tawdry's house. When Brown arrives, determined to arrest Peachum and the beggars, he is horrified to learn that the beggars are already in position on the parade route and only Mr Peachum can stop them. To placate Peachum, Brown's only option is to arrest Macheath and have him executed. In the next scene, Macheath is back in jail and desperately trying to raise a sufficient bribe to get out again, even as the gallows are being assembled.\n\nSoon it becomes clear that neither Polly nor the gang members can, or are willing to, raise any money, and Macheath prepares to die. He laments his fate and poses the ' Marxist ' questions: \"What's picking a lock compared to buying shares? What's breaking into a bank compared to founding one? What's murdering a man compared to employing one?\" (These questions did not appear in the original version of the work, but first appeared in the musical Happy End , another Brecht/Weill/Hauptmann collaboration, in 1929 \u2013 they may in fact have been written not by Brecht, but by Hauptmann).\n\nMacheath asks everyone for forgiveness (\"Grave Inscription\"). Then a sudden and intentionally comical reversal: Peachum announces that in this opera mercy will prevail over justice and that a messenger on horseback will arrive (\"Walk to the Gallows\"); Brown arrives as that messenger and announces that Macheath has been pardoned by the queen and granted a title, a castle and a pension. The cast then sings the Finale, which ends with a plea that wrongdoing not be punished too harshly as life is harsh enough.",

        "description": "Floyd Collins is a musical with music and lyrics by Adam Guettel , and book by Tina Landau . The musical is a dramatization of the death of American cave explorer , Floyd Collins near Cave City, Kentucky in the winter of 1925.\n\nThe musical opened Off-Broadway on February 9, 1996, where it ran for 25 performances. There have been subsequent London productions as well as regional U.S. productions. The show made its Broadway premiere in 2025 at the Vivian Beaumont Theater as part of Lincoln Center Theatre 's 2024\u201325 season.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe musical tells the story of Floyd Collins during the so-called Kentucky Cave Wars , a period where poor landowners in Kentucky were exploiting the caves found on their land in an attempt to draw business and tourism to the area that was later taken by the federal government to create Mammoth Cave National Park . The show opens with a prologue, \"The Ballad of Floyd Collins,\" in which those close to Floyd introduce the audience to the setting and the character.\n\nOn a brisk January day, Floyd enters Sand Cave, a cave on his neighbor's property, hopeful that he will find a cavern large enough to develop into a tourist attraction and turn his family\u2019s fortunes around (\"The Call\"). He expertly navigates narrow and difficult passages, using his voice and its echo to determine where to go next. Eventually, he does come upon such a cavern. Overjoyed, he yodels into the space, harmonizing with his own echo\u2014but since the cavern is too large for his lantern to illuminate fully, he can only speculate about the wonders it holds (\"It Moves\").\n\nFloyd begins to make his way out of the cavern, excited to tell everyone what he has found and work on making it accessible to the public (\"Time to Go\"). But as he heads out headfirst, a rock falls on his foot, trapping him inside a tunnel so narrow that he cannot even move his arms, let alone shift the rock. He calls for help, but is too far below ground for anyone to hear.\n\nThe next day, a trio of locals\u2014Bee Doyle, on whose land Floyd has been exploring; Ed Bishop, a fellow caver; and Jewell Estes, a local teenager\u2014find Floyd's jacket outside Sand Cave. They speculate that Floyd must have found something big down there. And if Floyd's gotten himself stuck? Well, it will probably turn out fine. After all, each of the three other men has been in equally tough situations and survived (\"'Tween a Rock and a Hard Place\").\n\nWhen the Collins family learns that Floyd is trapped, Floyd's father Lee is certain it is only a matter of someone being able to get down there and help him. As the men try to strategize, Miss Jane (Lee's wife and Floyd's stepmother) confides to Nellie (Floyd's sister) that Floyd recently told her about a dream he had about being trapped. Nellie, who has recently returned home from a mental asylum and who has a special connection with Floyd, tells Miss Jane that Floyd's gotten out of worse scrapes than this, and they should not worry (\"Lucky\").\n\nIn some versions: Floyd's family and fellow cavers discuss Floyd's love of exploring and the dangers involved (\"Where A Man Belongs\"). When this song is used, it replaces \"'Tween a Rock and a Hard Place\".\n\nFloyd's younger brother Homer goes down into Sand Cave to try to free him, but Homer cannot even reach his head. It becomes clear that Floyd's rescue will not be as easy as anyone had hoped, and Floyd begins to panic. To soothe him, Homer reminds him of the nights they've spent in caves together before, and promises Floyd that he'll spend tonight with him as well (\"Daybreak\").\n\nWilliam Burke \"Skeets\" Miller, a cub reporter for the Louisville Courier , arrives on the scene, having been dispatched to investigate whether Floyd\u2019s entrapment is a hoax. Being small and slender, he is able to squeeze all the way through to Floyd (\"I Landed on Him\"). Though he is terrified by the experience, he feels deep empathy for Floyd and joins the rescue effort. H.T. Carmichael, a local engineer, suggests fastening a harness around Floyd so they can pull him out, even if it means ripping his foot off.\n\nAs Skeets (the only one who has been able to make it all the way down to Floyd) fastens the harness around Floyd's torso, Floyd distracts himself by wondering whether he'll find love when he gets out (\"And She'd Have Blue Eyes\"). The pulling begins, but the harness idea is quickly discarded, as it hurts Floyd enough that he thinks it might kill him.\n\nLee becomes increasingly distressed. Miss Jane tells him that she loves his children as her own, and they will get through this together (\"Heart and Hand\").\n\nSkeets goes down into Sand Cave again, both to continue his efforts to dig around Floyd's body in hopes of reaching the rock that has trapped his foot, and to tell Floyd that his articles about the entrapment have been syndicated nationwide. He asks Floyd for an interview so he can quote him directly, and the two men bond as they converse. Floyd confesses that he is afraid he might die in this cave. Skeets swears to free him.\n\nAboveground, outsiders begin showing up, including a filmmaker who instantly becomes interested in putting Homer on the silver screen, and a doctor from Chicago who tells the family that amputating Floyd's leg to get him out would result in enough blood loss that he would probably die anyway. H.T. Carmichael takes charge of the rescue operation, declaring that nobody is to go into the cave again without his explicit approval. But Homer, having just learned from Skeets about how much digging progress has been made, sneaks past him and goes down to see Floyd again.\n\nHomer continues digging, attempting to widen the passageway Floyd is trapped in. As he works, Floyd becomes increasingly annoyed at the slowness of the progress. To distract Floyd and keep his spirits up, Homer plays a riddle game with him, in which the answers are all good memories from their shared childhood (\"The Riddle Song\"). By the end of the song, Homer has widened the passageway enough that he can squeeze through, and the brothers are able to embrace for the first time since Floyd became trapped.\n\n### Act II\n\nAs Skeets Miller\u2019s stories about Floyd draw national attention, legions of new reporters arrive, not just sniffing around for news but exaggerating every detail they find, in hopes that sensationalism will sell more papers (\u201cIs That Remarkable?\u201d)\n\nBy the next Sunday, tens of thousands of people from around the country have arrived at Bee Doyle\u2019s farm in hopes of seeing Floyd get rescued. Even the Collinses get swept up in \u201cThe Carnival\u201d\u2014Nellie dances with performers and gawkers, Lee sells photos of Floyd for a dollar apiece, and Homer starts getting offers to appear on the vaudeville stage.\n\nBelow ground, as Skeets tells Floyd about what\u2019s happening above, he tries to use a jack to pry the rock off Floyd\u2019s foot... but fails. As Skeets leaves the cave for what will turn out to be the last time, a collapse in the passageway cuts Floyd off completely from his would-be rescuers.\n\nWhen Nellie learns about the collapse, she becomes upset that she may never see her brother again, and dreams of freeing him (\u201cThrough the Mountain\u201d).\n\nMeanwhile, a divide in rescue strategy, the presence of an overwhelming amount of media, and the arrival of the National Guard deepens the tension between the locals and outsiders. Since the collapse has rendered the cave impassable, engineer Carmichael announces plans to dig a shaft down to Floyd. Homer, who opposes this plan, tells Carmichael that he doesn\u2019t know what he is doing. Carmichael orders Homer removed from the rescue site, which causes Homer to angrily reflect on whether he even belongs at home anymore (\u201cGit Comfortable\u201d).\n\n(In the 2025 Broadway production: Below ground, entirely isolated, Floyd finally comes up with an answer to a question Skeets asked him days ago. Skeets had asked what Floyd finds appealing about cave exploration; Floyd now describes the awe he feels when he explores caves. He imagines their long history, dating back to ancient times, and imagines himself a part of that history (\u201cIt Moves\u201d).)\n\nAs torrential rain slows progress on the Carmichael shaft, the mood aboveground becomes increasingly despondent. As the locals begin to talk about Floyd in the past tense, Homer begins seriously considering whether he should accept a vaudeville offer so he can tell Floyd\u2019s story (\u201cThe Ballad of Floyd Collins\u201d (Reprise)).\n\nSkeets Miller works in the Carmichael shaft, digging laterally in hopes of finally reaching Floyd. As he does so, he calls out to Floyd, but is unsure about whether he is really hearing a response. He apologizes for the part he played in turning Floyd from a human being into a media sensation.\n\nFloyd has a joyful vision of himself being reunited with Nellie, Homer, and everyone else (\u201cThe Dream\u201d). In this vision, Sand Cave has been developed and turned into a successful tourist attraction, and people have begun hailing Floyd as \u201cthe greatest caver ever known.\u201d But when he yodels as he did when he first discovered the place, hoping to show off the beautiful echoes he heard there, his voice doesn\u2019t echo back. This breaks the vision, and Floyd realizes not only that he is still trapped, but that he is about to die.\n\nSkeets informs the audience that by the time the shaft reached Floyd, he had already died of starvation and exhaustion.\n\nAs he faces death head-on, Floyd wonders aloud what heaven might be like, and hopes he\u2019ll be reunited with his deceased mother (\u201cHow Glory Goes\u201d). As he dies, he yodels into the cave again. This time, his voice echoes back.",

The two are instantly smitten, but Margaret steers her daughter away from the encounter, bringing her to the Uffizi Gallery where the marble statues and reaching figures in the paintings speak to Clara of her own yearnings (\"The Beauty Is\"). Fabrizio appears, hoping to arrange a time to meet with Clara, but Margaret intervenes again.\n\nFabrizio, alone, declares his love for Clara, along with a heartfelt cry of fear that she could never love anyone as lost and without position as he (\"Il Mondo Era Vuoto\"). Fabrizio begs his father, Signor Naccarelli, and his brother, Giuseppe, to help him appear more presentably for Clara. Giuseppe attempts to teach Fabrizio some dance steps as well (\"American Dancing\").\n\nAt the Duomo , Fabrizio catches up with Margaret and Clara, this time with Fabrizio's father, who is able to help penetrate Margaret's resistance to any further involvement. They all agree to meet later that day at sunset to take a walk and admire the view of the city from above at the Piazzale Michelangelo (\"Passeggiata\").\n\nMargaret and Clara are invited to have tea at the Naccarelli home. Giuseppe's wife, Franca, takes Clara on a tour of the apartment, and alone in a separate room, she warns Clara about how quickly love can stale in marriage (\"The Joy You Feel\"). Though the Naccarellis are universally impressed with Clara, Margaret tries without success to share her deep reservations. When she looks in Fabrizio's eyes and sees the love there, she cannot bring herself to disappoint him, as much as she feels she must; for there is something about Clara that none of these people know. Clara secretly makes plans to meet Fabrizio at midnight near the hotel.\n\nMargaret calls her husband Roy, who is back in the states. She tries to tell him what is happening with Clara and Fabrizio, but he is brusque and not very understanding, cutting short the conversation. Margaret, alone in her hotel room, reflects on the loneliness in her marriage (\"Dividing Day\"). She checks in Clara's room and finds that she is missing.\n\nOn her way to meet Fabrizio, Clara becomes lost in the maze-like streets of Florence. She loses all poise and control, becoming hysterical and screaming like a child (\"Hysteria\"). Her mother takes her back to the hotel and, as Clara sleeps, reveals the source of her disquiet to the audience. When Clara was a young girl, she was kicked in the head by a Shetland pony , and the accident has caused her mental and emotional abilities to develop abnormally. Margaret feels that she must take Clara away from Florence at once, and she steps down into the lobby to have a drink. While she is away, Fabrizio comes to the room, distraught; he cannot find the right words to express his feelings, and Clara urges him to use any other means; Clara accepts Fabrizio's proposal of marriage, and the two are embracing, half undressed, as Margaret walks in on them (\"Say It Somehow\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nMargaret takes Clara to Rome to distract her and put an end to the affair. Back in Florence, the Naccarelli household is in complete chaos. As the family despairs, Signora Naccarelli translates in an aside; Fabrizio believes he has ruined everything with Clara, his father attempts to comfort him, and Giuseppe and Franca desire finer details (\"Aiutami\").\n\nNo matter what Margaret tries, her daughter refuses to give her an inch, culminating in a painful confrontation wherein Margaret slaps Clara across the face. Clara erupts with a torrent of feeling, centered on Fabrizio and the nature of love (\"The Light in the Piazza\"). This causes Margaret to relent, to set aside her doubts and considerations, and to no longer stand in the way of the wedding. The two return to Florence.\n\nClara is instructed in the Latin catechism in preparation for converting to Catholicism while around her everyone in the extended family sings of their feelings, stirred up by the immediate presence of such intense, young love (\"Octet Part 1\"). Franca, in an attempt to arouse her husband's jealousy, kisses Fabrizio right on the mouth, and Clara witnesses it, breaking into a furious rant that ends with her throwing a drink on Franca (\"Clara's Tirade\"). As Clara breaks down, Franca commends her for her bravery and declares her own desire to fight for Giuseppe. She toasts the upcoming union and is joined by the rest of the family (\"Octet Part 2\").\n\nAt the wedding rehearsal, Clara and Fabrizio are filling out the necessary forms when Signor Naccarelli sees something on Clara's form that causes him to call off the wedding and take his family away at once. Clara wants to know what is wrong with her, but her mother says there is nothing at all wrong. With Clara sobbing and broken, alone in one of the pews of the church, Margaret reveals her worst fears and her shame at having been the source of her daughter's lifelong suffering. She resolves to do whatever it takes to give Clara a chance for happiness (\"The Beauty Is (Reprise)\").\n\nMargaret tries to reason with Signor Naccarelli, who saw Clara's childlike handwriting as she completed her marriage form. Seemingly unconcerned with her immaturity or her handwriting, Signor Naccarelli admits that he saw Clara write her age on the forms \u2013 26 \u2013 and that this makes her an unsuitable bride for his son who is only 20. Relieved that he has not discovered their secret, Margaret begs him to change his mind, but he will not. She invites him to take a walk with her, and the two wander from one end of Florence to the other as the sun slowly sets and the night comes on (\"Let's Walk\"). By giving him time to mull things over and by not pressuring him, Margaret succeeds in putting the wedding back on track. They share a kiss and Signor Naccarelli promises his family will meet the Johnsons at the church the following morning, as originally planned.\n\nFrom the hotel room, Margaret calls Roy to tell him about the wedding. As might be predicted, he insists that Clara cannot handle the responsibilities of marriage. Clara, in her wedding dress, stands in the shadows, overhearing her mother's side of the conversation. Margaret says, \"Just because she isn't normal, Roy, doesn't mean she's consigned to a life of loneliness. She mustn't be made to accept less from life just because she isn't like you or me.\" Shattered, Clara slips out of the hotel room and runs once more through Florence (\"Clara's Interlude\"), meeting Fabrizio at the church in order to tell him that she cannot marry him; she won't allow herself to cause him any pain. However, Fabrizio assuages all of her fears (\"Love to Me\").\n\nMoments before the wedding, Clara tells Margaret she can't leave her; Margaret assures her she can. Left alone, Margaret breaks open all the repressed doubts and yearnings that she has carried for years on end about love, realizing at last that the chance of love somehow outweighs the terrible risks, and joins the wedding ceremony (\"Fable\").",

The piece was one which founded the new style of French com\u00e9die musicale, the first to really use the latest rhythms of jazz ( one-step , fox trot ) along with a plot which emphasised comedy \u2013 with risqu\u00e9 dialogue of puns and anachronisms \u2013 more than the romantic style, which had predominated before. The story concerns a sculptor, his wife, and their attractions to, respectively, a model and a prince, as well as a disastrous gambling loss by the sculptor's secretary.\n\nThe piece opened in 1918, running for three years. Its success of the piece prompted imitators in Paris such as Le petit Phi-Phi (3 March 1922) and Les amants de Phi-Phi (13 March 1923). It also led to a spate of similarly titled stage works: Clo-Clo , D\u00e9d\u00e9 , You-You and Pan Pan . A 1922 London production, in English, was also successful.",
        "synopsis": "Setting\u00a0: the workshop of Phidias in Greece , around 600 BC.\n\n### Act I\n\nThe sculptor Phidias (Phi-Phi) has received a commission to create a group representing 'L\u2019amour et la Vertu fondent le Bonheur Domestique' ('Love and Virtue are the Foundation of Domestic Bliss'). After having looked over many models for 'la Vertu', he chooses Aspasie, a charming girl whom he had met in the streets of Athens. The girl pays him a visit, and he gets overcome by her attractions. Protecting herself from his advances with her umbrella, she breaks the arms off the Venus de Milo and the head from the Winged Victory of Samothrace .\n\nMadame Phidias enters and makes jealous comments to her husband. Aspasie leaves. Alone with Le Pir\u00e9e, secretary and confidant of her husband, Madame Phidias, as a faithful spouse, tells him how she had encountered a handsome young man who has been pursuing her. This is none other than Prince Ardim\u00e9don, who now enters. Embarrassed, Madame Phidias leaves Le Pir\u00e9e with the prince; Phi-Phi returns and after trying to sell him some sculptures (and his wife) engages the young man as the model for 'L\u2019Amour'.\n\n### Act II\n\nLe Pir\u00e9e having lost money at the races using Phidias\u2019s sculptures as wagers, the models agree to pretend to be the works of art. Pericles makes a visit to the sculptor and with Phi-Phi away, meets Aspasie; he too is overcome by her charms. (Her song imitates the refrain of \"Je suis toujours tout \u00e9tourdie\" from Manon ).\n\nPericles leaves and Madame Phidias comes in. She quickly gets rid of Aspasie telling her that her husband has decided not to use her as a model. Madame Phidias believes that only she can truly represent \u2018Vertu\u2019, and reluctantly Phi-Phi agrees. Madame Phidias takes her place beside Ardim\u00e9don, but the sculptor is called away, and the prince leads his virtuous partner off to a room nearby.\n\n### Act III\n\nNext day back in his studio Phi-Phi finds Ardim\u00e9don and his wife in each other\u2019s arms.

        "description": "She Loves Me is a musical with a book by Joe Masteroff , music by Jerry Bock , and lyrics by Sheldon Harnick .\n\nThe musical is the third adaptation of the 1937 play Parfumerie by Hungarian playwright Mikl\u00f3s L\u00e1szl\u00f3 , following the 1940 film The Shop Around the Corner and the 1949 musical version In the Good Old Summertime . (It surfaced again as 1998's You've Got Mail ). The plot revolves around Budapest shop employees Georg and Amalia, who, despite being consistently at odds with each other at work, are unaware that each is the other's secret pen pal met through lonely-hearts ads.\n\nThe musical premiered on Broadway in 1963 and ran for 301 performances, was produced in the West End in 1964, and received award-winning revivals on each side of the Atlantic in the 1990s (as well as numerous regional productions). Although the original Broadway run was not a financial success, She Loves Me slowly became a cult classic, and the massively successful 2016 Broadway revival became the first Broadway show ever to be live-streamed .",
        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nOn a beautiful summer day in Budapest in 1934, the employees of Maraczek's Parfumerie arrive at work (\"Good Morning, Good Day\").  Working at the shop are Ladislav Sipos, a fretful middle-aged salesman with a family; teenage delivery boy Arpad Laszlo; thirty-something Ilona Ritter, who is having an affair with suave Steven Kodaly; and Georg Nowack, the shy assistant manager.  Mr. Maraczek arrives to open the store, and soon business is under way (\"Sounds While Selling\"/\"Thank You, Madam\").  Georg has been exchanging letters with an anonymous woman he knows only as \"Dear Friend\", and he shares today's romantic letter with Sipos.  Maraczek advises Georg to get married and recalls being a bachelor (\"Days Gone By\").\n\nArpad begins stocking the shelves with a new musical cigarette case.  Mr. Maraczek insists that they will manage to sell one within an hour.  A nervous young woman, Amalia Balash, enters, hoping to obtain a job at the Parfumerie.  When Georg tells her they are not hiring, she demands to speak with Maraczek.  Amalia takes one of the cigarette cases and convinces a customer that it is really a musical candy box that plays each time it is opened to gently tell the owner \"no more candy\" (\"No More Candy\").  Maraczek is impressed and immediately hires Amalia.\n\nAs summer turns into autumn and then into the early days of winter, tension grows in the shop. Ilona and Kodaly are at odds, Mr. Maraczek is increasingly short-tempered with Georg, and Georg and Amalia bicker constantly. Georg finds solace in his anonymous romantic pen pal, not suspecting that his correspondent is none other than Amalia (\"Three Letters\"). Their fellow employees observe their bickering, and Sipos explains to Arpad that they argue because they unknowingly like each other very much. Arpad naively suggests they tell Georg and Amalia this, and Sipos retorts that they'd never believe it. Finally, in early December, the two \"Dear Friends\" arrange to meet in person.\n\nMaraczek humiliatingly dresses down Georg for a minor problem. Georg tells Sipos that tonight he will finally meet his \"dear friend\" (\"Tonight At Eight\").  Meanwhile, Amalia explains to Ilona that even though she has not met her \"dear friend\" yet, she knows him very well from his letters (\"I Don't Know His Name\").\n\nMr. Maraczek and Georg argue, and when it becomes obvious that Maraczek is about to fire Georg, Sipos knocks over the stack of musical cigarette boxes to distract him.  Maraczek reprimands Sipos and leaves.  Sipos tells Georg that no replacement would treat him as well as Georg does (\"Perspective\").  Maraczek insists that everyone stay late to decorate for Christmas, but Amalia says she must leave early for her date.  Georg asks to leave too, but Mr. Maraczek refuses to let him go.  Georg angrily quits, and the other employees sadly say goodbye to Georg (\"Goodbye Georg\").  Amalia leaves clutching a copy of Anna Karenina with a rose in it so that her \"dear friend\" will be able to identify her.  She wonders if \"dear friend\" will like her (\"Will He Like Me?\") Meanwhile, inside the shop, Kodaly begins seducing Ilona (\"Ilona\").  They make a date, but when Mr. Maraczek insists they must close the store early, Kodaly realizes that he has time for a 9:30 date that he previously scheduled.  He postpones his date with Ilona, and she angrily declares that she will never fall for a man like him again (\"I Resolve\").  Georg is nervous and asks Sipos to give \"dear friend\" a note explaining that Georg could not come.\n\nMr. Maraczek's private investigator enters the shop and tells him that Kodaly is having an affair with his wife.  Maraczek had assumed it was Georg.  The investigator leaves, and Maraczek's wife calls to say she'll be out late.  Maraczek points a gun at his own head and pulls the trigger as Arpad enters the shop.  Meanwhile, in the Cafe Imperiale, the head waiter is trying to maintain a romantic atmosphere as Amalia waits with her book and rose (\"Romantic Atmosphere\"). Georg and Sipos enter and are shocked to realize that Amalia is Georg's date; however, Amalia does not know Georg is her \"dear friend\".  Georg sits at Amalia's table and mocks her, singing a \"Tango Tragique\" about a woman who was murdered on a blind date (this song has been cut in later productions).  They argue, and Georg leaves.  As the cafe closes, Amalia, still waiting, begs \"dear friend\" not to abandon her (\"Dear Friend\").\n\n### Act Two\n\nThe next day, Mr. Maraczek has survived his suicide attempt, and Arpad comes to visit him in the hospital. Maraczek is impressed with Arpad's hard work in his absence, and Arpad begs to be promoted to sales clerk (\"Try Me\").  Georg also stops by, and Maraczek apologizes and asks him to return to his job.  Maraczek tells Georg to fire Kodaly and mentions that Amalia has called in sick.\n\nGeorg is worried about Amalia and visits her at her apartment.  She fears he has come to spy on her and tell the others she is not really sick, so she attempts to get out of bed and get ready for work (\"Where's My Shoe\").  Georg, seeing she is truly sick, forces her back to bed and presents her with a gift: vanilla ice cream.  He apologizes for his rudeness the previous night, but Amalia tells him that he was right about her date; if \"dear friend\" really loved her, he would have come.  Georg, meaning well, makes up a story that he saw an older, bald, fat gentleman looking into the cafe.  Georg says the man told him that he had to work and could not meet his date, and Georg surmises that he must be her \"dear friend\".  Amalia is surprised to find she enjoys her conversation with Georg.  After he leaves, she begins a letter to \"dear friend\" but can only think of Georg's kindness and his gift (\"Vanilla Ice Cream\").\n\nGeorg joyously realizes that Amalia loves him (\"She Loves Me\").  At Maraczek's, Ilona explains to Sipos that she has gotten over Kodaly; last night, she went to the library where she met Paul, a kindly optometrist (\"A Trip to the Library\").  Kodaly bids everyone goodbye (\"Grand Knowing You\").  With Christmas fast approaching, the employees are busy helping last-minute shoppers, and Georg and Amalia enjoy each other's company (\"Twelve Days to Christmas\"). On Christmas Eve, Amalia tells Georg she has invited \"dear friend\" to spend the evening with her and her mother.  She invites Georg as well, and he hesitatingly accepts.  Mr. Maraczek returns to the shop for a happy reunion, and Ilona announces her plans to accept Paul's proposal that night, even though he does not know he is going to propose yet.  Sipos leaves to join his family's Christmas party, and Maraczek takes Arpad for a night on the town.\n\nGeorg helps Amalia with her packages as she leaves the shop, and they accidentally drop one of the musical cigarette boxes.  Amalia intends to give it to \"dear friend\", but Georg says he really would like it; it will remind him of the day he first met her. He admits that he always thought Amalia was the sort of girl he could fall in love with.  Amalia confesses to having similar feelings, and Georg takes one of Amalia's letters to \"dear friend\" out of his pocket and begins reading it aloud.  Amalia finally understands that Georg really is \"dear friend\" and they kiss (\"Finale\").",

As they prepare for the show, working through their fears, self-consciousness, and anxieties, they overcome their inner demons and find strength in their camaraderie.",
        "synopsis": "While relocated to Buffalo, New York , the musical closely follows the film.\n\n### Act I\n\nIn depressed Buffalo, New York, the once-successful steel mills have grown brown with rust, rolling equipment has been removed, and the lines are silent. Best friends Jerry Lukowski and Dave Bukatinsky, along with the other unemployed mill workers, collect unemployment checks and ponder their lost lives (\"Scrap\"). Elsewhere, Dave's wife Georgie and her friends are celebrating their newfound independence and wealth as the sole earners of their families by attending a Chippendales performance (\"It's a Woman's World\").\n\nWhile hiding in the bathroom of the strip club, Jerry and Dave hear how unhappy Georgie is over Dave's insecurities (in part because of his weight) and Pam, Jerry's ex-wife, laments the loss of her marriage and her plans to take court action against him for the child support payments that he's failed to make since losing his job. Compromising the situation further is Jerry's son, Nathan, who reluctantly spends time with him; he has grown tired of his father's seeming lack of motivation.\n\nAfter talking to the stripper in the Chippendales act, Jerry and Dave are intrigued by the women's willingness to pay for a striptease act. Jerry is convinced that his ship has finally come in: he decides to organize a similar act of his own, with the intent to earn enough money to pay for his child support obligations (\"Man\").\n\nThe first to join the act is gauche and lonely Malcolm, a security guard at the steel mill where Dave and Jerry once worked. Malcolm tries to commit suicide by asphyxiating himself in his car through carbon monoxide poisoning. Dave pulls him out, and Jerry and Dave discuss various methods to commit suicide (\"Big-Ass Rock\").  Malcolm ultimately joins in and with the reassurance of his new-found friends behind him, he joins the fledgling lineup. His rescue and inclusion in the group gives him a newly optimistic and confident outlook on life. He also starts to grow more independent from his domineering, invalid mother, Molly.\n\nNext on Dave and Jerry's list is their former foreman, the middle-class aspirant Harold Nichols, who is taking a ballroom dance class with his immaculately groomed wife, Vicki. While Harold explains that he has concealed his unemployment from his materialistic wife, Vicki blithely sings about their marriage (\"Life with Harold\").  Dave and Jerry tell him of their scheme; with literally no options left, Harold agrees to be the act's choreographer .\n\nIn a sequence of scenes, former co-workers perform strip-tease auditions. One of the auditionees is invited to sit down after he flunks; he declines, saying that his children are outside waiting 'in the car' and that 'this is no place for kids' before glancing over at Nathan before leaving. Other auditioners are, hired: Noah 'Horse' Simmons, for his comprehensive dance knowledge (while overlooking evidence of advanced arthritis), and Ethan Girard, who longs to dance like Donald O'Connor in \" Singin' in the Rain \" and has a jaw-dropping, euphemism-inducing penis (\"Big Black Man\").  They are also joined by Jeanette Burmeister, a tough, seen-it-all showbiz musician who \"shows up, piano and all\" to accompany the boys' rehearsals.\n\nElsewhere, Dave contemplates his weight and Harold contemplates Vicki's spending habits (\"You Rule My World\"). At the first rehearsal, Harold feels the men are hopeless, but Jerry fires them up, encouraging them to think of it not as dance, but as sports moves (\" Michael Jordan 's Ball\").\n\n### Act II\n\nAs the men practice, doubts continue to creep in about whether this is the best way to make some money, due to their individual insecurities over their appearances. Jeanette is particularly straightforward (\"Jeanette's Showbiz Number\").\n\nRequiring a deposit at the club, Jerry tries to get seed money from Pam, which she denies.  Nathan eventually provides some college funds, and Jerry is moved by Nathan's growing belief in his father (\"Breeze Off the River\").\n\nLater, as the men are rehearsing at Harold's house, they undress in front of each other for the first time, and have nightmare visions that the women of the town will find them inadequate (\"The Goods\"). They are interrupted by repossessors who are scared off by the scantily clad men; their mutual friendships continue to grow.\n\nDuring a dress rehearsal, the boys get literally caught with their pants down  wearing thongs , causing  Jerry, Horse, Harold, Jeanette, and Nathan to be brought into a police station. Malcolm and Ethan successfully escape, and fall into a homoerotic embrace after they climb through the window of Malcolm's house. They are interrupted by the sudden illness of Molly.\n\nAfter Pam tearfully picks up Nathan (\"Man (Reprise)\"), the boys are brought together at the funeral of Malcolm's mother, where he is joined by Ethan in subtly announcing their relationship (\"You Walk with Me\"). Later, the men are approached on the street by local women acquaintances who have heard of their show. Jerry declares that their show will be better than the Chippendales dancers because they'll go \" the full monty \"\u2014strip all the way. Dave, meanwhile, quits less than a week before the show, deprecating himself as a 'fat bastard' whom no one would want to see in the nude\u2014including his wife, Georgie.\n\nTheir secret out, all seems lost for the members of Hot Metal\u2014their \"stage name\". But Georgie and Vicki reconfirm their love for their husbands despite their failures (\"You Rule My World (Reprise)\"). It is also revealed the arrest publicity has spiked ticket sales.\n\nWith not much left to lose, and a sold-out show, the men decide to go for it for one night, including Harold, who has finally gotten a job. Dave finds his confidence and joins the rest of the group, but Jerry has a last minute loss of his.  Nathan convinces him to go on and he joins the boys for the final performance. With the support of friends, family, and townspeople, the boys perform one final show (\"Let It Go\").",

Jeff and Hunter, two struggling writers in New York , discuss the possibility of entering the upcoming inaugural New York Musical Theatre Festival .

The scene morphs into song as they discuss setting their dialogue to music, imagine the success of their show, and express their longing for fame and recognition (\"Two Nobodies In New York\").\n\nThe two recruit their friends Susan and Heidi to help with the project. Jeff privately laments his writer's block; when his blank writing pad begins to look like Hunter, ideas begin to flow (\"An Original Musical\"). After Hunter's laptop crashes, resulting in much lost progress, Jeff and Hunter continue to battle writer's block by looking at song lists from old Playbills and brainstorming on a blank notepad; Susan and Heidi become voices in their heads, providing inspiration for their writing (\"Monkeys and Playbills\"). As they continue to write the show, excitement mounts; Hunter even ponders winning a Tony (\"The Tony Award Song\"), though Jeff reminds him that they have already cut the song he is in the midst of singing. Jeff and Hunter discuss their ambition to write for a living and become a part of the theatre industry they so admire (\"Part of It All\").\n\nAs Heidi and Jeff work on a solo about her doubts on the whole project, Hunter and Susan worry that they are just stringing sketches and novelty songs together and feel that they need to write something \"a little meatier\" (\"I Am Playing Me\"). Susan and Heidi become suspicious of each other (\"What Kind Of Girl Is She?\"). After a shared 'fake foggy dream sequence', the four express their doubts over the future and premise of their musical. Susan encourages them to keep going and 'kill their vampires', or the doubts preventing them from writing (\"Die, Vampire, Die!\"). Reenergized, they finish the show and, after discussing the show's production values (minimalistic set of four chairs, one costume throughout the show, etc.), they tackle the festival's submission paperwork. Seeing the form asking for their \"title of show\" and lacking a better name, they decide to name their show [title of show] . (\"Filling Out The Form\"). After a moment of doubt and a brief intimate moment between Hunter and Jeff, they finally submit the show to the festival.\n\nAgainst the odds, their musical is chosen for the festival. The four revel in their six performances at the festival (\"Montage Part 1: September Song\"); backstage, Heidi and Susan reconcile their differences and bond over their supporting roles in the show (\"Secondary Characters\"). The four find an industry producer interested in the show who encourages them to continue to develop it, first at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center before they get an offer to do the show Off-Broadway at the Vineyard Theatre . At their run there, they meet many industry stars, receiving a healthy mix of good and bad reviews as they soak up the energy and momentum of their Off-Broadway run.\n\nTen months later, Susan, Jeff, and Hunter are back at their 'day jobs' while Heidi receives an offer to join the cast of The Little Mermaid on Broadway. Hunter comes up with the idea of posting videos on the internet with the cast about the show to boost the show's popularity online \u2014 \"the [title of show] show\". The idea works \u2014 the show and the four go viral and the show's producer expresses interest in actually bringing the show to Broadway.\n\nAs plans progress toward taking the musical to Broadway, things begin to unravel: the four friends argue over changes to the show to make it more marketable, cutting some of its more risque content (\"Change It/Don't Change It\"). Hunter gets a voicemail from Sutton Foster and, much to Jeff's chagrin, suggests casting her in Heidi's role for marketability. Tensions build \u2014 everything finally boils over at a publicity photo shoot (\"Awkward Photo Shoot\"). Heidi is upset that Hunter wants to replace her, Susan laments the time-consuming nature of the show's development and is concerned about profit-sharing, Jeff is upset at Hunter for pushing hard for changes that wound the integrity of the show, and Larry (the accompanist) feels left out of the press photos and interviews. Hunter lashes out at all of them and leaves in a huff.\n\nLater, Hunter breaks the ice by apologizing. More apologies follow, and the four (led by Heidi) wax nostalgic over younger, happier, less complicated days (\"A Way Back To Then\"). They now understand that the show must sink or swim as it is \u2014 with the five of them, without a \"bankable\" star \u2014 because their relationship and the quality of their creation are more important to them than commercial success (\"Nine People's Favorite Thing\"). Having reached a resolution, they decide to end the show, to \"put the show out there and see what happens\" (\"Finale\").",

        "description": "Lennon is a musical with music and lyrics by John Lennon and book by Don Scardino , who also directed its premiere. The musical is about the life of Lennon and is notable for Scardino's choice to be almost exclusively based on Lennon's own words and to focus on Lennon's solo career, with no songs from the Lennon\u2013McCartney catalogue.\n\nThe \"$7 million bio-musical\" first opened in San Francisco , California , in April 2005.  After what The Times described as \"a troubled try-out in San Francisco, a cancelled run in Boston and a radical rewrite\", it had 42 previews and 49 performances on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre from 14 August to 24 September 2005.  The role of Lennon is played by performers of both sexes and different ages and skin colours, an approach Scardino said was inspired by \" I Am the Walrus \" where Lennon writes, \"I am he, as you are he, as you are me, and we are all together.\" This use of multiple actors was scaled back after the San Francisco production, with the final rewrite having a single actor narrating Lennon's story.\n\nYoko Ono was actively involved in the production, retaining final script approval and requiring the show's Broadway producers to complete the script and present it to her live (albeit in workshop format). The show's credits included the phrase \"With Special Thanks to Yoko Ono Lennon\".\n\nThe limited use of Beatles songs, attributed to creative choices and not licensing issues, led critics to dismiss the work as \"Ono-centric\". Ono was unapologetic about the choice: \"If we put ' Yesterday ' in, it's not really fair to the Beatles because we're leaning on their power.  We're talking about John now, thank you.\" She later said \"It is definitely John's story \u2013 from Liverpool 1940 to New York 1980. I am the B-side , and that's how it should be. I think he would have loved it.\" The musical also conspicuously omits any mention of May Pang , Lennon's lover for a period of 18 months in 1974\u201375 when the singer was separated from Ono.

        "description": "Love Never Dies is a romantic musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber , lyrics by Glenn Slater , and a book by Lloyd Webber, Ben Elton , Frederick Forsyth , and Slater. It is a sequel to the long-running 1986 musical The Phantom of the Opera and was loosely adapted from Forsyth's 1999 novel The Phantom of Manhattan .\n\nThe plot is not based on the storyline in the original 1910 novel by Gaston Leroux . Lloyd Webber stated, \"I don't regard this as a sequel\u2014it's a stand-alone piece.\" He later clarified, \"Clearly, it is a sequel, but I really do not believe that you have to have seen Phantom of the Opera to understand Love Never Dies .\" Glenn Slater subsequently explained that Lloyd Webber \"didn\u2019t view it as a sequel as much as 'a second story with these characters'\". The musical is set in 1907, which Lloyd Webber states is \"ten years roughly after the end of the original Phantom \", although the events of the original actually took place in 1881.\n\nIn the show, Christine Daa\u00e9 is invited by Oscar Hammerstein I for her American debut, until an anonymous impresario contracts her to perform at Phantasma, a new attraction on Coney Island . With her husband Raoul and son Gustave in tow, she journeys to Brooklyn , apparently unaware it is actually the Phantom who has arranged her appearance in the popular beach resort.\n\nAlthough Lloyd Webber began working on Love Never Dies in 1990, it was not until 2007 that he began writing the music. The show opened at the Adelphi Theatre in London's West End on 9 March 2010, with previews from 22 February 2010. It was originally directed by Jack O'Brien and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell , starring Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess . However, the show closed for four days in November 2010 for substantial re-writes, which were overseen by Lloyd Webber, and it re-opened with new direction from Bill Kenwright . Set and costume designs were by Bob Crowley . The original London production received mostly negative reviews. A subsequent Australian production starring Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne , featuring an entirely new design team and heavy revisions was generally better received, although the show finally closed with heavy discounting to tickets. A planned Broadway production, which was to have opened simultaneously with the West End run, was cancelled, the amount of negative press having deterred potential backers.

        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nThe story is set exactly 300 years in the future in a vaguely Orwellian world. Earth has been renamed as the \"iPlanet\" (sometimes called \"Planet Mall\" in older productions) and is controlled by the Globalsoft Corporation (\" Innuendo \").\nOn the iPlanet, mainstream commercial conformity reigns, in which Ga Ga Kids watch the same movies, listen to computer-generated music, wear the same clothes and hold the same thoughts and opinions. Musical instruments are forbidden, and rock music is unknown (\" Radio Ga Ga \").\n\nIn the newest graduating class is black sheep Galileo, who has dreams and hears strange words in his head, most of which are lyrics of songs long since lost, though he does not understand their significance. Despite his teacher's advice, Galileo refuses to conform like the rest of his classmates (\" I Want to Break Free \"). He is captured by Khashoggi, commander of Globalsoft's police. The teacher also reveals a second anomaly, a young, goth woman named Scaramouche who is openly mocked and derided by her peers (\" Somebody to Love \"). She, too is arrested by Khashoggi.\n\nRuling Globalsoft Corporation is Killer Queen (\" Killer Queen \"). She has heard of a prophecy that instruments have been hidden somewhere on the iPlanet in the \"place of living rock\", and a \"bright star\" will show the way to them. She orders Khashoggi to get to the bottom of the matter and crush the rebel Bohemians who believe in the prophecy. Killer Queen then basks in her power over the iPlanet (\" Play the Game \").\n\nGalileo and Scaramouche wake up in a hospital. They realise that they are kindred spirits, feared by the rest of their society. (\" Under Pressure \") They flee together from the hospital.\nKhashoggi has blown up all the rocks on the iPlanet, but cannot find any supposed hidden instruments. Killer Queen insists that they have won, and the prophecy will not come to pass (\" A Kind of Magic \").\n\nOn the streets, Bohemians Britney and Oz climb out of the sewers, where they have been gathering materials to make musical instruments. Britney is a believer in the Dreamer who will fulfil the prophecy, and insists to the cynical Oz that it's the key to bringing real music back into the world (\" I Want It All \"). Brit and Oz hear footsteps approaching, and hide.\n\nGalileo and Scaramouche arrive, with Galileo talking about his belief that he has a destiny. He says that he dreamt a name for the woman: \"Scaramouche\". Britney and Oz reveal themselves, and accuse Galileo and Scaramouche of being spies, because Galileo keeps spouting words of the \"sacred text\". Galileo insists that he only hears those words in his head. Britney tests him, singing the first few lines of \" Bohemian Rhapsody \". Galileo responds correctly with the subsequent lines, and Britney realises that he is the Dreamer of the prophecy. They bring Galileo and Scaramouche to the Heartbreak Hotel , which is located at the ruins of the Tottenham Court Road tube station , where the Bohemians have made their home (\" Headlong \").\n\nThe Bohemians explain to Galileo and Scaramouche that they take their names after singers long gone, and mourn the deaths of those who died young (\" No One But You \"). The group then celebrates the reason rock bands started playing music in the first place, which was for love  (\" Crazy Little Thing Called Love \").\n\nKhashoggi and his police suddenly arrive at the Heartbreak Hotel, where they round up the Bohemians for capture. Britney breaks free and battles the police in order to enable Galileo and Scaramouche to escape, but is killed in the process.\n\n### Act Two\n\nThe Ga Ga Kids of the iPlanet move on in their regular fashion (\" One Vision \").\n\nGalileo and Scaramouche have escaped the Heartbreak Hotel, and realise that back at the hospital, tracking devices were installed in their heads. They remove them, and upon realising that they are all that's left of the rebels, they confess their love for each other (\" Who Wants to Live Forever \").\n\nThe surviving Bohemians have been rounded up by Khashoggi to be tortured (\" Flash \"). When he cannot get any information from them about the prophecy, he has them brain-drained (\" Seven Seas of Rhye \"\u2014 interpolating \" Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon \").\n\nGalileo wakes up, and tells Scaramouche that he had a dream that the Bohemians were sent to the Seven Seas of Rhye. Scaramouche agrees they have to go there, but then Galileo insists that she stay because she's a \"chick\", to which Scaramouche takes offence. They argue, and decide that both of them will go to the Seven Seas of Rhye, but their relationship will be purely professional.\n\nBack at Globalsoft headquarters (\" Fat Bottomed Girls \") Khashoggi reports that the Bohemians are no longer a problem. Killer Queen prematurely starts to celebrate (\" Don't Stop Me Now \"). Khashoggi interrupts her, explaining that Galileo and Scaramouche escaped. Killer Queen declares this is the last time Khashoggi has disappointed her, and has him brain-drained (\" Another One Bites the Dust \").\n\nGalileo and Scaramouche are making their way to the Seven Seas of Rhye, arguing all the way (\" Hammer to Fall \"). At the Seven Seas of Rhye pub in Montreux, Pop the librarian is serving drinks to the lifeless Bohemians (\" These Are the Days of Our Lives \"). When Galileo and Scaramouche arrive, Pop explains the full nature of the prophecy to them as inscribed by the three remaining members of the band Queen just before they were sentenced to death (Brian May, his last request being a final guitar solo, apparently delayed his execution for three and a half days). Scaramouche figures out that the bright shining star of the prophecy is rock star Freddie Mercury's statue, and that it's pointing to Wembley Stadium , the \"place of living rock\". After initially preparing to travel by bicycle, (opening of \" Bicycle Race \") Scaramouche protests that the method \"isn't very cool\", and so they travel there by motorcycle. (\" Headlong [reprise]\")\n\nWembley Stadium is in ruins, with no instruments to be found. Reconciling and their love for each other rekindled (\" Love of My Life \"), Scaramouche inspires Galileo to perform the opening of \" We Will Rock You \", and an electric guitar is revealed. Galileo cannot play it, but Scaramouche can (\" Brighton Rock solo\"). Pop hacks into Globalsoft's network so their music can be heard by everyone on the iPlanet, and Killer Queen is defeated (\" Tie Your Mother Down \", \" We Will Rock You / We Are the Champions \").\n\nAfter the curtain calls (\" We Will Rock You [ fast version] \"), the entire company performs \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" as an encore .\n\n### Variations\n\nInternational productions of the musical feature changes in the story and song line-up in order to better reach target audiences. All the main characters retain their general personalities across productions, but the names vary depending on the production. (See characters section below.)\n\nThe dialogue contains many references to popular culture, with lyrics from numerous non-Queen songs and albums inserted into the text. These references are constantly changing and, according to writer Elton, this is to keep the show \"fresh\". Songs that have been referenced include The Beatles ' \" Help! \", \" Strawberry Fields Forever \", \" Penny Lane \", \" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds \", \" I Am the Walrus \" and \" Hello, Goodbye \", Little Richard 's \" Tutti Fruitti \" and \" Long Tall Sally \", the theme from The Wombles , The Goodies ' \" Funky Gibbon \", Bruce Springsteen 's \" Born to Run \", David Bowie 's \" Rebel Rebel \" and \" Space Oddity \", The Wild Ones' \" Wild Thing \", The Rolling Stones ' \" Honky Tonk Women \", Bob Dylan 's \" Mr. Tambourine Man \", ABBA 's \" Dancing Queen \" and \" Fernando \", Oasis' \" (What's the Story) Morning Glory? \", Eminem 's \" The Real Slim Shady \", Spice Girls ' \" Wannabe \", Elton John 's \" Goodbye Yellow Brick Road \", Black Lace's \" Agadoo \", The Clash 's \" Complete Control \", Teletubbies and songs by Amy Winehouse and Michael Jackson .\n\nMay often performed with the London production on special occasions such as anniversaries and Freddie Mercury's birthday. At the final performance of the original production in 2014, he and Roger Taylor both performed.\n\nHannah Jane Fox , who originated Scaramouche, was the last original principal cast member to remain with the show. She gave her final performance on 28 January 2006, four years after the musical opened at the Dominion Theatre, and the event was celebrated with May appearing on stage to perform the guitar solo during the \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" encore.\n\nOn 5 September 2006, the London show celebrated what would have been Freddie Mercury's 60th birthday. During the song \" Don't Stop Me Now \", ordinarily sung by Killer Queen, the band \" McFly \" (who were at No. 1 with the song on the singles charts the previous week) emerged onto the stage to sing it instead. Brian May and Roger Taylor joined the encore, performing Taylor's \" Say It's Not True \" as a duo. Ben Elton also addressed the audience on this special occasion. The following week, tickets to the London show went on sale from \u00a319.46, Mercury's birth year.\n\nOn 14 May 2007, the London show celebrated its fifth anniversary with a special show featuring both May and Taylor playing in the final section of the show. Writer Ben Elton also made an appearance to present a special plaque to the cast, May and Taylor. During the portion of the show based in Pop's bar, the line \"But the Pub Landlord has a Bike\" was followed by a cameo appearance of British comedian Al Murray , who came up through the stage on a motorcycle.\n\nThe London show's sixth anniversary performance was held on 21 May 2008, a week after its actual anniversary due to the unavailability of Brian May. For the first time since the show opened, the Killer Queen character performed the entire song \"Don't Stop Me Now\", a musical number which is normally interrupted by the Khashoggi character. This unique performance is acknowledged by Killer Queen's dialogue: \"No, you didn't let me finish, you never let me finish. For six long years, night after night, week after week, year after year. Well, tonight, I'm going to finish\", to which Khashoggi replied: \"It's not in the script!\" Killer Queen proceeded to yell, \"Screw the script!\" before continuing the song. Additionally, May joined Killer Queen and the dancers on stage for the performance. After the encore, Elton made a thank you speech, after which the entire cast performed \" The Show Must Go On \", accompanied by May on guitar.\n\nThe seventh anniversary of the London show was celebrated on Monday 18 May 2009. The show contained a special appearance from Brian May and Ben Elton who emerged together in a cloud of smoke during the encore rendition of \" Bohemian Rhapsody \" with May playing guitar. As with the year before, Elton gave a thank you speech and the entire cast performed \" The Show Must Go On \", accompanied by May on guitar.\n\nOn Saturday 12 September 2009 at the early matinee performance Brian May again emerged in a cloud of smoke playing the guitar in \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". The reason for this appearance was not clear. He did the same again at the matinee on Saturday 14 November 2009.\n\nOn Sunday 31 January 2010 in The O2 Dublin, Brian May once again played \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" with the company during the finale of both the matinee and evening shows to celebrate the end of their year-long tour.\n\nOn Saturday 5 September 2010, May also appeared though a cloud of smoke, again to play \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". This was due to the annual cast change, as well as a celebration of what would have been Freddie Mercury 's 64th birthday, and afterwards Brian gave a farewell speech to the cast who were leaving.\n\nOn Saturday 5 October 2013, May appeared through the cloud of smoke to play \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" once more.  This was because it was cast change and some of the cast were leaving. May appeared to be very emotional when he was giving his speech.\n\nThe 20th anniversary UK tour, also directed by Ben Elton, was choreographed and staged by Jacob Fearey. This version opened at the King's Theatre with the full cast onstage for \"Innuendo\". The script is the same as the School Cast's version, but with fewer elements of the original. \"Play the Game\" is cut, and the chorus is backstage for most of the numbers. \"Don't Stop Me Now\" is left in its entirety, without Khashoggi interrupting Killer Queen. For the first time in the show's history, \"The Show Must Go On\" has been added to the production closing Act 1.\n\nIn the new West End version, in Act 2, \"Love of My Life\" is only played as a brief instrumental. Some of the elements of the 20th anniversary tour production remain.",

Bruno, gives her a ride in Bruno's limousine, starting rumours that she is engaged to the wealthiest man in Scotland. American producer John Frost, her employer, has just had the star of his next show, Frolics to You , walk out on him because of his desperate financial situation.

Her dressmaker, Madame Amanda, gives her more clothes, and sends the bill to Bruno.

        "title": "The Pirates of Penzance",
        "description": "The Pirates of Penzance; or, The Slave of Duty is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W.\u00a0S.\u00a0Gilbert . Its official premiere was at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City on 31 December 1879, where it was well received by both audiences and critics. Its London debut was on 3 April 1880, at the Opera Comique , where it ran for 363 performances.\n\nThe story concerns Frederic, who, having completed his 21st year, is released from his apprenticeship to a band of tender-hearted pirates. He meets the daughters of the incompetent Major-General Stanley, including Mabel, and the two young people fall instantly in love. Frederic learns, however, that he was born on 29 February, and so, technically, he has a birthday only once each leap year . His indenture specifies that he remain apprenticed to the pirates until his \"twenty-first birthday\", meaning that he must serve for another 63 years. Bound by his own sense of duty to honour his bond with the pirates, Frederic's only solace is that Mabel agrees to wait for him faithfully. The pirates' maid-of-all-work, Ruth, eventually reveals a fact that saves the day.\n\nThe Pirates of Penzance was the fifth Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration and introduced the much-parodied \" Major-General's Song \". It has been one of the most frequently played Gilbert and Sullivan operas, along with The Mikado and H.M.S. Pinafore . Pirates was performed for over a century by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in Britain until the copyrights expired and by many other opera companies and repertory companies worldwide.\n\nModernized productions include Joseph Papp 's 1981 Broadway production, which ran for 787 performances, won the Tony Award for Best Revival and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical and spawned many imitations; the production was further adapted as a film in 1983 . Another Broadway adaptation by Rupert Holmes was presented in 2025 as Pirates! The Penzance Musical .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nOn the coast of Cornwall , during Queen Victoria 's reign, Frederic celebrates the completion of his twenty-first year and the end of his apprenticeship to a gentlemanly band of pirates (\"Pour, oh pour the pirate sherry\"). The pirates' maid of all work, Ruth, appears and reveals that, as Frederic's nursemaid long ago, she made a mistake \"through being hard of hearing\": Mishearing Frederic's father's instructions, she apprenticed him to a pirate, instead of to a ship's pilot (\"When Frederic was a little lad\").\n\nFrederic has never seen any woman other than Ruth, and he believes her to be beautiful. The pirates know better and suggest that Frederic take Ruth with him when he returns to civilisation. Frederic announces that, although it pains him, so strong is his sense of duty that, once free from his apprenticeship, he will be forced to devote himself to the pirates' extermination. He also points out that they are not successful pirates: since they are all orphans, they allow their prey to go free if they too are orphans. Frederic notes that word of this has got about, so captured ships' companies routinely claim to be orphans. Frederic invites the pirates to give up piracy and go with him, so that he need not destroy them, but the Pirate King says that, contrasted with respectability, piracy is comparatively honest (\"Oh! better far to live and die\"). The pirates depart, leaving Frederic and Ruth. Frederic sees a group of beautiful young girls approaching the pirate lair, and realises that Ruth misled him about her appearance (\"Oh false one! You have deceived me!\"). Sending Ruth away, Frederic hides before the girls arrive.\n\nThe girls burst exuberantly upon the secluded spot (\"Climbing over rocky mountain\"). Frederic reveals himself (\"Stop, ladies, pray!\"), startling them. He appeals to them to help him reform (\"Oh! is there not one maiden breast?\"). The girls are fascinated by him, but all reject him, except one: Mabel responds to his plea, chiding her sisters for their lack of charity (\"Oh sisters deaf to pity's name for shame!\"). She offers Frederic her pity (\"Poor wand'ring one\"), and the two quickly fall in love. The other girls discuss whether to eavesdrop or to leave the new couple alone (\"What ought we to do?\"), deciding to \"talk about the weather,\" although they steal glances at the affectionate couple (\"How beautifully blue the sky\").\n\nFrederic warns the young ladies that his old associates will soon return (\"Stay, we must not lose our senses\"), but before they can flee, the pirates arrive and capture the girls, intending to marry them (\"Here's a first rate opportunity\"). Mabel warns the pirates that the girls' father is a Major-General (\"Hold, monsters!\"), who soon arrives and introduces himself (\" I am the very model of a modern Major-General \"). He appeals to the pirates not to take his daughters, leaving him to face his old age alone. Having heard of the famous Pirates of Penzance, he pretends that he is an orphan to elicit their sympathy (\"Oh, men of dark and dismal fate\"). The soft-hearted pirates release the girls (\"Hail, Poetry!\"), making Major-General Stanley and his daughters honorary members of their band (\"Pray observe the magnanimity\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe Major-General sits in a ruined chapel on his estate, surrounded by his daughters. His conscience is tortured by the lie that he told the pirates, and the girls attempt to console him (\"Oh dry the glist'ning tear\"). The Sergeant of Police and his corps arrive to announce their readiness to arrest the pirates (\"When the foeman bares his steel\"). The girls loudly express their admiration of the police for facing likely slaughter by fierce and merciless foes. The police are unnerved by this and leave reluctantly.\n\nLeft alone, Frederic, who is to lead the police, reflects on his opportunity to atone for a life of piracy (\"Now for the pirates' lair\"), at which point he encounters Ruth and the Pirate King. They have realised that Frederic's apprenticeship was worded so as to bind him to them until his twenty-first birthday \u2013 and, because that birthday happens to be on 29 February (in a leap year ), it means that technically only five birthdays have passed (\"When you had left our pirate fold\"), and he will not reach his twenty-first birthday until he is in his eighties. Frederic is convinced by this logic and agrees to rejoin the pirates. He then sees it as his duty to inform the Pirate King of the Major-General's deception. The outraged outlaw declares that the pirates' \"revenge will be swift and terrible\" (\"Away, away, my heart's on fire\").\n\nFrederic meets Mabel (\"All is prepared\"), and she pleads with him to stay (\"Stay Frederic, stay\"), but he feels bound by his duty to the pirates until his 21st birthday \u2013 in 1940. They agree to be faithful to each other until then, though to Mabel \"It seems so long\" (\"Oh, here is love, and here is truth\"); Frederic departs. Mabel steels herself (\"No, I'll be brave\") and tells the police that they must go alone to face the pirates. The police muse that an outlaw might be just like any other man, and it is a shame to deprive him of \"that liberty which is so dear to all\" (\"When a felon's not engaged in his employment\"). The police hide on hearing the approach of the pirates (\"A rollicking band of pirates we\"), who have stolen onto the estate, intending to take revenge for the Major-General's lie (\"With cat-like tread\").\n\nJust then, Major-General Stanley appears, sleepless with guilt, and the pirates also hide (\"Hush, hush! not a word\"), while the Major-General listens to the soothing breeze (\"Sighing softly to the river\"). The girls come looking for him. The pirates leap out to seize them, and the Pirate King urges the captured Major-General to prepare for death. The police rush to their defence but are easily defeated. The Sergeant has one stratagem left: he demands that the pirates yield \"in Queen Victoria 's name\"; the pirates, overcome with loyalty to their Queen, do so. Ruth appears and reveals that the pirates are \"all noblemen who have gone wrong\". The Major-General is impressed by this and all is forgiven. Frederic and Mabel are reunited, and the Major-General is happy to marry his daughters to the noble ex-pirates after all (\"Poor Wand'ring Ones\" (reprise)).",

        "title": "Keating!",
        "description": "Keating! is a sung-through musical which portrays the political career of former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating .  Keating was Prime Minister between 1991 and 1996; the musical follows him from his ascent to the leadership through to his eventual electoral defeat by John Howard . It was written by Casey Bennetto , who was inspired to write the show by his disappointment at the results of the 2004 federal election , which saw Howard's Coalition government returned for a fourth term.  The musical takes a humorous, satirical tone and presents a positive image of Keating while frequently criticising the Howard government . Bennetto describes the show as \"ridiculously pro-Paul Keating\".\n\nOriginally performed by musical group the Drowsy Drivers, the show achieved rapid success from its low-budget premiere at the 2005 Melbourne International Comedy Festival where it enjoyed a sold-out run and won an unprecedented three festival awards. In 2006, Neil Armfield directed an extended Company B production of Keating! , now with two acts and six new songs written by Bennetto. The Company B production toured Australia, receiving favourable reviews and winning Helpmann Awards for Best Musical and Best Regional Touring Production. In 2008 a live recording of the show was broadcast nationally on ABC2 ; it was released on DVD in November 2008, through Madman Entertainment .",
        "synopsis": "The following summary refers to the extended, two-act version of the musical.\n\n### Act One\n\nThe show begins with Bob Hawke introducing the political situation of 1990 and the contrasting personalities of Hawke\u2014with his enthusiasm for \" footy \" and cricket\u2014and his deputy, Paul Keating, who is fond of \"the works of Mahler \" (\"My Right Hand Man\"). While Hawke admires Keating's economic prowess, he is perplexed by the other man's \" un-Australian \" interests.  Keating emerges and shares some of his life story and his hopes to gain the leadership from Hawke as they had agreed to in a deal known as the Kirribilli Agreement for the venue at which it was reached (\"Do It in Style\").  However, Hawke reneges on the deal and Keating returns to the back bench .  In a rock ballad, vaguely in the style of Queen , he sings of his desolation before resolving to challenge for the Prime Ministership (\"I Remember Kirribilli\").  He confronts Hawke with the blue-eyed soul -style \"It's Time\"; the song refers to the name of former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam 's famous 1970s campaign and uses Keating's fondness for collecting antique clocks as a motif for his belief that it is indeed time for a change of leadership.  Keating becomes Prime Minister and sings of his ambitions for the nation\u2014including a treaty with Indigenous Australians, an Australian republic and improved relationships with Australia's Asian neighbours\u2014in a reggae song (\"Ruler of the Land\").\n\nAs Keating celebrates his success, Gareth Evans cautions that the political life of a Prime Minister is limited in the minor-key Latin tune \"The Beginning Is The End\".  Both he and the ghost of Gough Whitlam counsel Keating to \"maintain your rage\". Keating then faces off against Opposition Leader John Hewson in a freestyle rap battle , arguing over the merits of Hewson's \" Fightback! \" policy platform, with Keating winning the battle due to his superior command of colourful invective, much of which is drawn from actual Keating quotes (\"On The Floor\"). Angered, Hewson challenges Keating to call an early election, but Keating refuses in the song \"I Wanna Do You Slowly\".  The song's title again refers to a well-known Keating quote, but takes on a sexual interpretation in the slow, Barry White -style funk number. The Keating government contests the 1993 federal election , and in an animated video Kerry O'Brien , Michael Kroger , Robert Ray and Antony Green report on the incoming results in scat over ukulele (\"Antony Green\").  Labor wins, and Keating sings about the unexpected victory as \"the sweetest victory of all\", using a famous phrase from his actual election night speech (\"Sweet\").\n\n### Act Two\n\nIn the ska tune \"The Arse End of the Earth\", which refers to Keating's private description of Australia, both Keating and Evans complain about the day-to-day issues of the economy and their unfavourable portrayal in the commercial media getting in the way of their larger agenda, including republicanism, a new flag , and Aboriginal reconciliation. Alexander Downer replaces Hewson as Opposition Leader for a short and unsuccessful period.  In a costume of fishnets, corsetry and lipstick that alludes to a photograph of the actual Downer posing in fishnet stockings for a competition, he sings his belief that he is just \"too freaky\" for the leadership (\"Freaky\"). Meanwhile, Evans has an extramarital affair with Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot (typically played by a male) (\"Heavens, Mister Evans\").  In an understated minor-key bossa nova song, Keating sings of the need to recognise and apologise for the damage done by white colonisation and subsequent subjugation of the Australian Aboriginal population (\"Redfern\"), before segueing into a more upbeat mambo about the Mabo decision by the High Court of Australia and his attempts to use the decision to promote a reconciliation agenda (\"Ma(m)bo\").\n\nJohn Howard becomes leader of the Opposition, presenting a new threat to Keating.  Howard describes his intense desire for power and his thirst for revenge against the petty humiliations put on him as a child in a menacing minor-key march (\"Power\").  However, in the media he presents himself as \"a normal bloke and nothing more\" (\"The Mateship\"). Through various costume changes, he attempts to cast himself as a sports fan, a friend of the Australian soldier and a farmer, though the song implies that these are only costumes. The song also refers to the \"children overboard\" affair , his criticism of political correctness , and his use of immigration as a political issue, some of which occurred after the actual Howard's subsequent election to Prime Minister.  In a slow rock duet, Keating and Howard both beseech voters to \"Choose Me\".  However, as the 1996 electoral polls close, Keating concludes that he is doomed electorally.  He sings of his unachieved dreams and with some bitterness at what he sees as the backward-looking message of his opponent in a country-influenced ballad referring to former Labor Prime Minister Ben Chifley 's description of Labor's overarching goals (\"The Light on the Hill\").\n\nIn the final number, \"Historical Revisionism\", the election tightens dramatically and the results come to hang on a single polling booth\u2014the theatre in which the musical is playing.  Keating wins and Howard concedes with the line \"Well, I'm sorry... that I lost!\" (a reference to his unwillingness to support a formal apology to the Aboriginal people). As the song's title indicates, the actual Keating did not win the 1996 election.  The song segues into a reprise of \"Ruler of the Land\".",

The story is about a group of \"dork-like\" characters who dream of winning a spot as the opening act in Clay Aiken 's new tour. The music was written by Jon Balcourt, lyrics co-written by Balcourt and Todd Ellis, and directed by Dan Tursi. The original story was conceived and outlined, including plot, songs, and characters, by Ellis.\n\nThe show began previews at the 45th Street Theatre on July 5, 2007. The show closed on its official opening night of August 12, 2007, due to poor ticket sales and bad word of mouth.",
        "synopsis": "The lights fade up on a silhouetted statue. Robed members enter slowly, as if in a procession, and begin to circle the statue. When the cloth is stripped away the audience realizes this is a fan club for Clay Aiken ! (\"Opening: Idolize\").\nEmily, the leader of the group, takes the members through the meeting's traditional schedule and agenda (\"The Meeting\"). Different members of the group are slowly introduced: JD, a jock who wants to get out of the small town, Connor, a nerdy pianist who seems to have trouble fitting in, Cicada, the human dictionary who gets in everyone's way, Kodi, the theatrical ham who never ceases to make an entrance, Cass, the gothic masochist who spends more time poking pins into her doll than paying attention at the meeting, Alex, the tough tomboy who constantly tries to avoid Duncan, and Duncan, the goofy \"cowboy\" who is constantly seeking Alex's attention.\n\nAs the meeting progresses the members share their discontent with living in a small town, and reflect on life outside (\"Small Town Blues\"). An unexpected guest appears as the meeting continues. Adrienne, Emily's sister, has returned from her unsuccessful audition for American Idol and tries to appear as a big star-to-be that has the know-how to whip the hapless group into shape in time for a competition coming to town: to be the opening act for Clay Aiken's new tour (\"15 Minutes\"). The group decides to create a song and dance number that will impress Clay, but it cannot be completed with the discipline and focused required in all rehearsals (\"Discipline\").\n\nJD is practicing basketball after the meeting, and happens upon a pole in the garage that the club uses to gather. Slowly he morphs from a basketball playing hip-hop dancer to a pole-dancing male stripper wannabe. Kodi, Cicada and Emily enter and catch him in the act, almost speechless, but laughing it off, nonetheless. Shortly after, Alex and Duncan enter in a fight once again, as always, with Duncan pleading for Alex to give him a chance and let him take her out on a date. JD admits to the group that he did not get the basketball scholarship he claimed, and instead has different plans for his future (\"Chip'n'Dale Days\").\n\nConnor is home working on the music to the song he is writing for the group to perform. While at home, Cass enters behind him unannounced and catches him at the piano with his pants down (a way of relaxing while practicing, he claims). The tension between the two is evident and it is clear that there are shared feelings from both sides. However, neither is strong or brave enough to take a step towards admitting it. When the two are about to kiss, Adrienne interrupts and Cass leaves to go to rehearsal. Adrienne gives Connor some new music she says she written as a backup to the act they are already working on, and demands he play it for her to practice (\"Prima Donna, Fabulous\"). Connor is stunned and realizes that Adrienne is planning the act to sabotage the group's chances of winning so that she can steal the spotlight. She laughs and tells him it is too late and the others will think he was in on it with her. She leaves for un rehearsal and Connor is left wondering what to do.\n\nAt rehearsal, the group practices the mundane, cheesy number for the last time (\"Quakin' for Aiken\"). Adrienne and Connor enter during the rehearsal and the group soon realizes what has been going on, and blames Connor for double-crossing them. They leave one by one, and it seems like the group of friends has fallen apart. Adrienne leaves Connor to himself, enjoying her success as she exits the garage (\"Prima Donna, Fabulous (reprise)\").\nEmily is passing her time working on a clay bust of Clay's head, and begins to believe that it takes on all too real a likeness to her idol (\"Burnin' Hunk of Clay\").  When Alex, JD, Kodi and Cicada return to the garage in hopes of remaining friends, they share their disbelief that Connor could do something like this to them. They all take turns bashing Idol's most popular judge, Simon Cowell , and ultimately tell him in their minds that he does not matter and neither do his harsh statements (\"Simon Says\").\n\nMeanwhile, Cass (who took Connor's \"betrayal\" the hardest of all), is sitting alone with her doll, while Connor is at home drowning his sorrow and lamenting the loss of the one girl he ever loved (\"Distance\").\n\nGraduation day has arrived, and Emily throws away her clay bust, deciding she is better off without a crazy obsession. Kodi enters, with less than a flair, and Cicada enters with him, slightly softer in tone and appearance than usual. One by one the group is reforming, as Duncan and JD return as a jock and stripper, respectively. Included in this rebirth of the group is Alex, who has cleaned the grease off her clothes and cleaned up her hair. Cass enters and amazes all with her gentle girl-next-door appearance. She has removed the dark makeup and black clothes and returned to the way she was before she decided to be monochromatic. Last to return is Connor, who has become a suave, smooth talker in hopes of winning Cass and his friends back (\"Family of Misfits\").\nThe group has now made amends, but Adrienne returns having won the competition. She reveals that the contest was a joke and that the prize was simply to sing in a commercial for Clay's new brand of chicken. Disappointed, Adrienne apologizes to her old friends, and the group gets ready to graduate. As they go off into the world they are now ready to face whatever life has in store for them, knowing they will always have each other, and that being who they really are is more important than putting up a facade (\"Finale: Realize\") (\"15 Minutes (reprise)\").",

        "description": "A Man of No Importance is a musical with music by Stephen Flaherty , lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and a book by Terrence McNally , based on the 1994 Albert Finney film, A Man of No Importance .  It tells the story of an amateur theatre group in Dublin and their leader, who is determined to stage a version of Salome at his church, despite the objections of church authorities.",
        "synopsis": "In 1964 in Dublin , Ireland, Alfie Byrne is the director of an amateur theatre troupe that has been shut down by the Sodality of the Sacred Heart. The group, The St. Imelda's Players, is based at the church. Alfie, a bus conductor, wants to stage a production of Oscar Wilde 's Salome at his church, despite the objections of church authorities.\n\nAs he reflects on events, the actors in the troupe become, in effect, a Greek chorus and take him through a typical day of \"A Man of No Importance\", in the form of a play in which he is not the director but the star. As the \"play\" unfolds, the people in Alfie's life appear: his sister Lily, a handsome bus driver Robbie Fay, and newcomer Adele Rice. Alfie \"performs\" by speaking Wilde's words to Adele, impressing the bus passengers (who are members of the acting group). As Alfie prepares dinner for himself and Lily, he tells her that  he has met a woman. Lily has delayed marriage with her boyfriend Mr. Carney to take care of Alfie until he marries, and is happy for him (\"Burden of Life\"). Alfie explains that he is not interested in marriage to Adele \u2013 he wants her to act in 'Salome'. Frustrated, Lily castigates Alfie for wasting his time in amateur theatre. The next day, Alfie goes around to Mr. Carney and  the other troupe members to offer them parts in \"Salome\". Everyone is extremely excited about a new show starting, and each member shows their acting resume as they sing about their excitement (\"Going Up!\"). The next day, Alfie delays the bus from leaving just to allow Adele to catch the bus, which she was late for due to an appointment with the doctor. He attempts to convince her to be Princess Salome, the titular character of \"Salome\", by reading some verses of the play to her. Adele believes that Alfie is making fun of her like many in her old town and storms out of the bus. Confused, Alfie follows her out of the bus. Despite her fears that she, a regular common girl from Roscommon, would never be able to portray a princess, Adele is touched by his words and agrees to be in the play (\"Princess\").\n\nAfter the first reading, Alfie attempts to talk Robbie into being \"Salome\"'s main romantic lead of John the Baptist. Robbie dismisses Alfie's attempts to get him involved, and conversely invites him to take a step into his own world, convincing Alfie to explore the streets of Dublin and to go to a pub with his pals (\"Streets of Dublin\"). At the pub, Alfie goes through several traditions for newcomers, including ordering a pint and singing a song in front of Robbie's pals (\"Love's Never Lost\"). Robbie's pals are not impressed, leading to Alfie to wander off where he is propositioned by Breton Beret. Alfie is flustered by Breton and returns home, troubled about his true identity. Meanwhile, Mr. Carney is with Lily at her and Alfie's home, condemning \"Salome\" as horrid pornography. Shortly after, Mr. Carney and Lily share some private drinks as they discuss Alfie's 'odd' habit of reading books and cooking foreign dishes; Mr. Carney attempts to woo Lily all the while, but Lily refuses to marry \"till [Alfie's] wed\" (\"Books\"). Alfie interrupts them as he returns home, and storms up to his room. As he gazes at himself in the mirror, he sees Oscar Wilde in a dream, and admits that he loves Robbie (\"Man in the Mirror\"). After a rehearsal of 'Salome', Lily invites Adele for Sunday dinner, saying that Alfie is hesitant to speak for himself (\"Burden of Life\" \u2013 Reprise). As Alfie is walking her home, Adele tells him that in her home town she has a boyfriend, John, and starts crying when she can't explain why he isn't here with her. Understanding about secrets, Alfie advises her that everything's alright (\"Love Who You Love\").\n\nAlfie bumps into Breton Beret again after he's escorted Adele home, and he propositions Alfie again before going on his way. Alfie is trapped between his own shame and desire, but Oscar Wilde again advises him that the way to eliminate temptation is by giving in.\n\nAs Mrs. Patrick sings a hymn (\"Our Father\"), Alfie is confessing to Father Kenny, as he tells about his minor sins. Alfie hears Robbie in a disembodied voice, but he cannot confess to his feelings (\"Confession\"). After church, Alfie leaves Lily and Mr. Carney to pay respects at their father's grave; there he meets Baldy, who brings a bouquet of white lilies to lay at his wife Mary's grave, reminiscing about the \"Cuddles that Mary Gave\" before encouraging Alfie to find a wife of his own. One and a half weeks before the opening night, the troupe is rehearsing and going through some interesting ideas on how to address the problems of props, costumes, lighting, promotion, and choreography (\"Art\"). Struggling through the lines of the final scene where Princess Salome professes her love to the severed head of John the Baptist, Adele suddenly cries and tells Alfie that she is pregnant, then leaves after Alfie awkwardly confirms that she is unmarried. Alfie is called to an emergency Sodality meeting organized by Mr. Carney, where the play 'Salome' is deemed blasphemous (\"A Man of No Importance (Reprise)/Confusing Times\"); Monsignor cancels it and orders that the St. Imelda's Players be ended.\n\nAlfie, feeling sad, goes to the bus station where he catches Robbie engaging in extramarital affairs with Mrs. Patrick. Shocked, Alfie questions Robbie's professed love to Mrs. Patrick, as she is married with 3 children. Robbie is furious at Alfie's judgments and berates Alfie for judging him when Alfie has lived a loveless life, before leaving Alfie alone (\"Love who you Love (Robbie's Reprise)\"). Going home to his room, Alfie is visited by a multitude of visions of the townfolk, Robbie, and Oscar Wilde, who tell him how to dress and how to express his hidden self (\"Man in the Mirror\"). Convinced that \"the only way to get rid of temptation is to yield to it\" and newly dressed in clothes that indicate his sexuality, Alfie goes to the pub and propositions Breton Beret. Breton takes Alfie's hand, caresses him, but suddenly punches Alfie in the next moment. Breton calls others over to beat him as well. As they beat him, Alfie cries out in pain for Robbie and Breton reveals that they regularly use this method to hunt for \"poofters\". He and the others only stop beating him and run away when a policeman comes over to investigate. Lily and Carney find Alfie with the policeman and take Alfie home, but not before the policeman reveals that Alfie won't press charges for assault because it would reveal that Alfie is gay.\n\nThe next morning, Lily and Alfie are having breakfast when they erupt into an argument after Lily refuses to eat what may be \"tainted\" food, with Alfie venomously explaining that he's never had any opportunity to be tainted by homosexual relations. Lily responds with both fury and despair, bemoaning the wasted years looking after her brother and asking why he never told her the truth. He leaves in the middle of her argument, leaving her alone as she ends with \"you must have known I'd love you all the same\" (\"Tell me Why\"). The news spreads that Alfie is gay and he finds that many people now treat him with contempt and disgust, including his abusive supervisor and new bus driver who they claim was to take the spot of Robbie who \"fled as far as he could when he heard the news\". Adele comes to see Alfie one last time before she goes to England to have her baby, showing true empathy for his situation and encouraging him as Alfie once encouraged her (\"Love who you Love (Adele's Reprise)\"). Finally, Alfie is alone at St. Imelda's hall and thinks back on his life, coming to know that he can no longer hide (\"Welcome to the World\"). A ray of sunlight enters the dimly lit room as Robbie walks in, and he explains that he's here to play the part of John the Baptist and that he was forcefully placed in another station by the supervisor. He is followed by most of the members of St. Imelda's Players (other than Mr. Carney), who reveal that they don't care about his sexuality as they know that Alfie is a good and kind man. Lily enters as well, bringing refreshments stolen from Mr. Carney. Now a member of the new acting troupe, Robbie reads a passage from Oscar Wilde's \" The Ballad of Reading Gaol \" (\"Poem\").",

On the trip they meet Susan Bradley, who is travelling to the same town to marry the man whose beautiful letters she received when she answered a \"lonely-hearts\" ad .\n\nUnfortunately, when she arrives, her husband-to-be turns out to be an \"old coot\" who does not at all meet her expectations, and vice versa.  They start to argue and list their own personal faults, which they claim not to have mentioned in their letters. With their mutual disinclination to continue with the marital union clear,  they jointly decide to call off the wedding.\n\nWith the marriage safely cancelled, he reveals to Susan that his letters were actually ghost-written as a joke by Ned Trent, the local saloon owner. Susan, rightly furious, confronts Ned to tell him off, in the process endearing herself to him.\n\nSusan joins the Harvey Girls and she soon becomes their leader in fighting against the attempts by Trent's business associate, Judge Sam Purvis, to scare them away to maintain his own thriving business running the large saloon in town. The Harvey Girls also face the animosity of the so-called \" dance-hall girls ,\" led by Em, who is in love with Trent and sees Susan as a rival.\n\nTrent visits the Harvey House, sees its value along with the other trappings of civilization, and then tells Purvis to leave them alone. Purvis continues with his campaign of intimidation, finally burning down the restaurant. Trent offers his saloon as a replacement and Em and the dance-hall girls leave town. Susan, thinking that Trent too is leaving, gets on the train, but Em, seeing that Susan loves Trent so much that she is willing to give up everything for him, stops the train and points out Trent, riding toward them on his horse. Ultimately, they wed in the desert, surrounded by the Harvey Girls.",

        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nRen McCormack, an ordinary city teenager living in Chicago, IL, dances off the stresses from his long and arduous eight-hour work day at a dance club with friends. But this is his last visit; he tells them, due to financial pressures brought on by his father's abandonment, he and his mother Ethel have to move to a small town in the middle of nowhere: Bomont (much to the chagrin of his friends, who gripe, \"Bomont?! Where the hell is Bomont?!\"), where his aunt and uncle have offered them a place to stay. After arriving in town, Ren and Ethel attend church and get their first glimpse of the Reverend, Shaw Moore. A deeply religious, conservative man and a prominent authority figure in the town, Moore gives a long sermon lambasting the evils of \"rock and roll\" music and its \"endless chant of pornography\" (\"Footloose/On Any Sunday\").\n\nAfter church, Ren immediately finds himself at odds with the repressive, stifling atmosphere in Bomont and meets Ariel, the Reverend's daughter and only person seemingly unfazed by her father's iron-fisted control. Ariel quickly dismisses Ren and runs off to a gas station where she meets her boyfriend Chuck Cranston, the local bad boy, and his buddies Travis and Lyle (\"The Girl Gets Around\"). While attempting to give Ariel her forgotten jacket, Rev. Moore catches Chuck with his hands around his daughter, much to his displeasure.\n\nThe next day at his new school, Ren accidentally bumps into Willard Hewitt, a slow-witted cowboy with strong loyalty to his mother, who decides to beat him up. Ren charms him and the two become friends. Ren, annoyed by how little there is to do in town, tells Willard about his exciting life in Chicago and starts to dance in the school's hallway (\"I Can't Stand Still\"). Willard tries to stop him, but Ren ignores his protests and puts on a show in front of everyone, including the school's principal, who angrily explains to him that dancing is illegal in the town of Bomont. Willard quickly comes to Ren's defense, explaining he is new in town and does not know the rules. As the hallway clears, Ren is introduced to Ariel's best friends: Rusty, Wendy Jo and Urleen. Rusty flirts with her crush, Willard, telling him how brave he is to have stood up to the principal on Ren's behalf. The girls explain to a bemused Ren that dancing in Bomont is, in fact, illegal; years ago, after a horrifying car accident killed four kids returning from a dance in a neighboring county, Moore became extremely righteous and campaigned to pass a law forbidding all residents from dancing. They warn him to lie low unless he wants to get into even more trouble than he already is. Unfortunately for Ren, his reputation has preceded him; the adults in town begin turn on him, leading to his uncle Wes slapping him after Ren loses his part time job (\"Somebody's Eyes\").\n\nAfter a night out with Chuck, Ariel returns home to her mother, Vi, and a disgruntled Shaw, who stubbornly ignores Ariel's repeated attempts to get him to engage in conversation. Exasperated, she leaves the room in a huff. Alone with his wife, Shaw expresses his concern over Ariel's rebellion and her relationship with Chuck, but when Vi attempts to advocate for her daughter and to assure him the fling will soon cool down, he silences her and storms off to finish writing his sermon. Vi, upset with not having a voice in her life, and Ethel, dealing with her new life circumstances, particularly after being forced into silence after her son is slapped, unknowingly commiserate with each other. They are joined by Ariel, and the three, each alone, lament how they have to stifle themselves and their opinions (\"Learning to be Silent\").\n\nAfter school the next day, Ariel, Rusty, Wendy Jo, and Urleen do their homework at the Burger Blast, a local restaurant. Ren, now an employee there and dressed in his uniform, complete with roller skates, discusses his woes with Willard and questions him about his relationship with Rusty; he thinks she is very good-looking, but is confused by her non-stop talking. When Ren takes Ariel's order, she flirts with him, but Willard warns Ren that Chuck Cranston would not be happy if the two became involved. Ariel talks with her friends about how she wants to find a decent guy; one that will fight for her (\"Holding Out for a Hero\"). After Ariel realizes she's late to meet Chuck, he shows up in a fury and tries to force her to leave with him. Though Ren comes to her defense, it's Betty Blast, the restaurant owner, who ultimately breaks up the fight. Chuck storms off and Ren assumes he'll be fired again, but Betty tells him to come back tomorrow.\n\nAriel, impressed with Ren after standing up to Chuck, takes him out to a field to see a passing train after he gets off work, where they open up to each other. Ariel tells him how her father was before the accident and her future plans, while Ren details how his father left his family. Upon Ariel's advice, he yells his grievances to the train as it passes. Unbeknownst to them, Chuck witnesses the pair together.\n\nAfterwards, Ariel and Ren walk back to her house, which catches Moore and Vi by surprise, as they had believed Ariel had been at home in her room while they hosted a bridge game downstairs. On top of Shaw's displeasure at his daughter's disobedience, a nervous Ren unintentionally insults him in an attempt to ease his worries, making the situation more awkward and causing all of Shaw's friends to dash off. As Ren leaves, an irritated Shaw sternly orders Ariel to cease her visits with him, but Ariel retaliates, claiming that all he is doing is making her feel like a prisoner. After a fed up daughter and wife storm off, Shaw begins to feel a pang of guilt, pondering whether he is being fair to his daughter and the problematic task of being both a preacher and a father (\"Heaven Help Me\").\n\nAt school the next day, Ren shows up late to gym class with Ariel and Willard after being jumped by Chuck. They try to explain this to the Coach, but he ignores their protests and punishes the entire class with fifty push-ups each. Ren laments that the citizens of Bomont are so \"wound up\", muttering that at least in Chicago, he had the clubs to turn to in times of stress, to which Willard jokingly suggests that they \"should take the coach dancing.\" Ren realizes that throwing a dance would be the perfect way to alleviate the teenagers' pressures, while at the same time making a statement to Moore and the town council. Ren reveals his plan to Ariel and all of his classmates, eventually winning them over. Word of this reaches Moore, who, as the one responsible for banning dancing to begin with, is determined to do anything within his power to ensure that a dance does not happen (\"I'm Free/Heaven Helps The Man\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nRen, Ariel, Willard and Rusty visit a dance hall in neighboring town, where they listen and dance to a live country band (\"Still Rockin\u2019\"). Rusty repeatedly attempts to dance with Willard, but he weasels his way out, dragging Ren off to the bar to get drinks, where he explains that he doesn't know how to dance. Rusty overhears them, as do several cowboys, who begin to mock Willard. Rusty comes to his defense, saying that he might not be perfect, but she loves him anyway. Ren tries to teach Willard to dance, who after much initial stumbling and apprehension whips off an amazing dance combination, much to Rusty's surprise (\"Let's Hear it for the Boy\").\n\nChuck shows up at the Moores' home, looking for Ariel, and is caught by Shaw and Vi. As Chuck leaves, he tells them that Ariel is not where they think she is. When Ariel returns home, pretending she was at her friend's house studying, her parents reveal that they know she wasn't there. The argument between Shaw and Ariel starts to boil over and Vi attempts to intervene, but when Ariel suggests Shaw doesn't listen to anyone, he slaps her. Ariel runs off, leaving Shaw deeply shaken. Vi tries to console him, but urges that his reprimanding is not all that logical (\"Can You Find it in Your Heart?\").\n\nMeanwhile, Ren, Willard and their friends try to find a way to present their idea to the town council. Ren shows them a speech he's prepared, as a rap (\"Dancing Is Not A Crime\"), but his friends aren't too sure about it. Ren, extremely discouraged, considers forgetting the whole idea. Willard shares with Ren some advice from his beloved mother: \"You can't back down\" (\"Mama Says/Mama Says Encore\"). Just as Ren's confidence has been restored, Ariel arrives, revealing she has just been beat up by Chuck, leaving her with a black eye . While Ariel tells everyone to leave her alone, Ren breaks through her defenses and comforts her. Ariel takes Ren to a hidden spot under a train bridge. There, Ren finds her poetry written on the walls and Ariel admits who she wrote them for: her deceased brother, Bobby, one of the kids who died in the car accident after the dance years ago. Ariel tells Ren how, in his grief over the loss of his son, Shaw shut down, and convinced himself banning dancing was the only way to \"save\" the town. She also gives Ren a Bible marked with various passages he can use for his motion. It is then they both realize they've fallen in love with each other (\"Almost Paradise\").\n\nAt the town council meeting, Ren stands up and attempts to explain his reasoning to the council, which includes the principal, coach, his aunt & uncle, and Moore. After he is quickly shot down by the council, Vi stands up for him, forcing the room to listen to his claim. Using direct quotes from the Bible, Ren argues that dancing is a profound, ancient, and historically religious celebration of life, and therefore, shouldn't be illegal. Ren is favorably supported by the crowd, particularly his fellow students, but the council, under pressure from Shaw, refuse to listen and the motion is unanimously dismissed.\n\nAfter the meeting, Ethel explains to Ren that Shaw had those votes locked no matter what, and she suggests that Ren go talk to him face to face. Ren, now at the Moore home, tells Shaw he is taking his anguish over his son's death out on the entire town. They have a heated argument, but when Ren points out that they're both dealing with grief \u2014 Moore's loss of his son, Ren's loss of his father \u2014 Shaw is struck by Ren's insight, moving him. Ren leaves and Ariel joins Shaw downstairs. The two share a tender moment; Ariel tells Shaw that she believes in him and gives him a long, meaningful hug. She leaves, reminding him about his sermon in the morning. Shaw struggles with his actions and what to do next. (\"Heaven Help Me Reprise\")\n\nAt the next service, Shaw informs the whole congregation that he is giving the teenagers his blessing to hold a dance, ultimately abolishing the law. They are overjoyed. After church, Ren asks Ariel to the dance and Willard invites Rusty, telling her that he is even willing to dance with her. Ariel rejects Chuck, threatening to press charges if he contacts her again. He leaves in a huff, not before Travis and Lyle choose the dance over him. When the crowd leaves, Vi and Shaw are left alone. Shaw asks Vi for her forgiveness and tells her how much he loves her. The two embrace and start to sway, to which Vi remarks, \"we're almost dancing\" (\"Can You Find it in Your Heart? Reprise\").\n\nThe teenagers finally get their dance, even Shaw, Vi, and all the rest of the townsfolk attend. Together, they all celebrate their newfound freedom and the right to dance (\"Footloose (Finale)\").",

The flaming dummy sets the big tent on fire and the two of them flee through Africa .

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nWendla Bergmann, an adolescent in late 19th-century Germany , laments that her mother gave her \"no way to handle things\" and has not taught her the lessons she is meant to know as a young woman (\"Mama Who Bore Me\"). She tells her mother that it is time she learned where babies come from, considering that she is about to be an aunt for the second time. Her mother cannot bring herself to explain the facts about conception clearly to Wendla, despite knowing her daughter is reaching puberty . Instead, she simply tells Wendla that to conceive a child a woman must love her husband with all of her heart. The other young girls in town \u2013 Martha, Thea, Anna and Ilse \u2013 appear to be similarly na\u00efve and are upset about the lack of knowledge presented to them (\"Mama Who Bore Me (Reprise)\").\n\nAt school, some teenage boys are studying Virgil in Latin class. When Moritz Stiefel, a very nervous and anxious young man, sleepily misquotes a line, the teacher chastises him harshly. Moritz's classmate, the rebellious and highly intelligent Melchior Gabor, tries to defend him, but the teacher will have none of it, and hits Melchior with a stick. Melchior reflects on the shallow narrow-mindedness of school and society and expresses his intent to change things (\"All That's Known\").\n\nMoritz describes a dream that has been keeping him up at night, and Melchior realizes that Moritz has been having erotic dreams which Moritz believes are signs of insanity. To comfort the panicked Moritz, Melchior, who has learned sexual information from books, tells Moritz that all of the boys at their age get these dreams. Moritz, Melchior and the other boys \u2013 Ernst, H\u00e4nschen, Otto and Georg \u2013 share their own sexually frustrated thoughts and desires (\"The Bitch of Living\"). Moritz, who is uncomfortable talking about the subject with Melchior, requests that he give him the information in the form of an essay, complete with illustrations.\n\nAll the girls, except Ilse, are gathered together after school; they tease each other as they fantasize about marrying the boys in the town. Martha admits that she has a crush on Moritz, but is made fun of by the other girls. At the top of the list is the radical, intelligent, and good-looking Melchior (\"My Junk\"). Moritz has eagerly digested the essay that Melchior prepared for him, but complains that his new knowledge has only made his dreams even more vivid and torturous. Melchior tries to calm and comfort his friend, but Moritz runs off in frustration. All of the boys and girls express their desires for physical intimacy (\"Touch Me\").\n\nWhile searching for flowers for her mother, Wendla stumbles upon Melchior. The two reminisce on the friendship they once shared as children and share a moment while sitting together in front of a tree. Each of them considers what it would be like to give in to their physical desires for one another (\"The Word of Your Body\"), but they do not do so. Meanwhile, at school, Moritz sneaks a look at his test results and is thrilled to learn that he has passed his midterm examinations, and tells the other boys. They are ecstatic, save the skeptical H\u00e4nschen. However, the teacher and schoolmaster, who claim they cannot pass everyone, decide to fail Moritz anyway, deeming his passing grade still not up to the school's lofty standards.\n\nMartha accidentally admits to her friends that her father abuses her physically and sexually and that her mother is either oblivious or uncaring. The other girls are horrified to hear this, but Martha makes them promise not to tell anyone, lest she end up like Ilse, a friend from childhood who now wanders homeless and aimless after her similarly abusive parents kicked her out of the house (\"The Dark I Know Well\"). Later, Wendla finds Melchior again at his spot in the woods and tells him about Martha's abuse. Melchior is appalled to hear this, but Wendla convinces him to hit her with a switch , so that she can try to understand Martha's pain. At first Melchior is determined to do nothing of the sort, but reluctantly complies. He gets carried away in the beating, taking his own frustrations out on Wendla and throws her to the ground. Disgusted with himself, Melchior runs off as Wendla is left lying on the ground, weeping. Alone, Wendla finds that Melchior has left his journal on the ground. She picks it up and takes it with her.\n\nMoritz is told he has failed his final examination; when Moritz tells his father that he will not be progressing in school, he reacts with disdain and contempt. Rather than attempting to understand his son's pain, his father is only concerned with how the others in town will react when they see \"the man with the son who failed.\" Moritz writes to Melchior's mother, his only adult friend, asking for money to help him flee to America ; she tenderly but firmly denies his request and promises to write his parents to discourage them from being too hard on him (\"And Then There Were None\"). Devastated by her refusal and feeling he has few choices left, Moritz considers killing himself.\n\nIn a stuffy hayloft during a storm, Melchior expresses his frustration about being caught between childhood and adulthood (\"The Mirror-Blue Night\"). Wendla finds him once again, telling him she wants to return his journal, and each apologizes for what happened in the forest. Melchior, disappointed in himself from the night before, urges her to leave. Wendla ignores this, instead suggesting they run in the rain until they \"get soaked to the skin\". Before long, they begin to kiss. Both of them nervously continue to entangle themselves, and then hesitate, sensing that what they are doing is something very powerful. Wendla is not entirely sure of what they are about to do but is certain that it is unlike anything that she has known before. They continue and then have sex in the hayloft; as Melchior penetrates her, Wendla cries out (\"I Believe\"). (Note: This scene was very much softened from the show's Off-Broadway run, where consent from Wendla was unclear and stage notes suggest explicit rape. Later, as staged by the Broadway show, Wendla gives explicit consent to Melchior, but does so without full understanding of what they are going to do.)\n\n### Act II\n\nWendla and Melchior are finishing their moment of confused intimacy in the hayloft; they reflect on and discuss what has just happened (\"The Guilty Ones\"). (In the Off-Broadway production, Act II began with \"There Once Was a Pirate\".)\n\nMoritz, having been thrown out of his home, wanders the town at dusk, carrying a pistol when he comes across Ilse, a childhood friend of his. Ilse tells him she has found refuge at an artists' colony, and they reminisce in some childhood memories and \"remarkable times\". She invites him to come home with her and join her in sharing some more childhood memories, and maybe something more. Moritz refuses and Ilse does everything she can to change his mind (\"Don't Do Sadness/Blue Wind\"). After affirming to Ilse that he truly wished he could go with her, Moritz refuses and Ilse leaves, distraught and upset. Realizing that Ilse was his last chance to escape the fate he's set out for himself, Moritz quickly changes his mind and calls after her, but she is gone. Alone and believing that he has nowhere to turn, Moritz shoots himself.\n\nAt Moritz's funeral , each of the children drops a flower into his grave as Melchior laments the passing of his friend while touching on the factors that led to his death, including the way his parents treated him (\"Left Behind\").\n\nBack at school, the schoolmaster and teacher feel the need to call attention away from Moritz, whose death was a direct result of their actions. They search through Moritz's belongings and find the essay on sex which Melchior wrote for him. They seize the opportunity to lay the blame of Moritz's death on Melchior, and although Melchior knows that he is not to blame, he knows there is nothing he can do to fight them and is expelled as a result (\"Totally Fucked\").\n\nElsewhere that night, H\u00e4nschen meets up with his shy and delicate classmate Ernst. Ernst tells H\u00e4nschen about his plans to become a pastor after school, and H\u00e4nschen shares his pragmatic outlook on life. He is amazed with how Ernst has remained so innocent despite the horrible things happening around them. They kiss and Ernst reveals that he loves H\u00e4nschen. (\"The Word of Your Body (Reprise)\").\n\nWendla has become ill, and her mother takes her to visit a doctor. He gives her some medication and assures them both that Wendla is suffering from anemia and will be fine, but takes Wendla's mother aside and tells her that Wendla is pregnant . When her mother confronts her with this information, Wendla is completely shocked, not understanding how it could have happened. She realizes that her mother lied to her about how babies are made. Although she berates her mother for leaving her ignorant, her mother rejects the guilt and insists Wendla tell her who the child's father is. Wendla reluctantly surrenders a passionate note Melchior sent her after they consummated their relationship. She reflects somberly on her current condition and the circumstances that precipitated it, but resolves with optimism about her future child (\"Whispering\").\n\nMeanwhile, Melchior's parents argue about their son's fate; his mother does not believe that the essay he wrote for Moritz is sufficient reason to send him away to reform school . When Melchior's father (Callum) tells his wife about Wendla's pregnancy, she finally agrees that they must send Melchior away, which they do without telling him that Wendla is pregnant.\n\nDuring this time, Melchior and Wendla keep contact through letters, delivered by Ilse. At the reform school, Melchior gets into a fight with some boys who grab a letter he has just received from Wendla and use it in a masturbation game. As one of the boys reads from the letter, Melchior finally learns about Wendla and their child, and he escapes from the institution to find her. Meanwhile, a very terrified and clueless Wendla is taken to a back-alley abortionist by her mother.\n\nWhen Melchior reaches town after a few days, he sends a message to Ilse, asking her to have Wendla meet him at the cemetery at midnight. Ilse, however, can take no action, as Melchior \"hasn't heard\" about Wendla. She shows Anna, Martha, and Thea the letter. They are equally horrified, and decide not to tell Melchior what has happened. At the cemetery, Melchior stumbles across Moritz's grave and swears to himself that he and Wendla will raise their child in a compassionate and open environment. When Wendla doesn't show up for their meeting, Melchior begins to feel a little uneasy. Looking around, Melchior sees a fresh grave he had not noticed before. He reads the name on the stone \u2013 Wendla's \u2013 and realizes that Wendla has died after a botched abortion. Overwhelmed by shock and grief, he takes out a razor with intent to kill himself. Moritz's and Wendla's spirits rise from their graves to offer him strength. They persuade him to journey on, and he resolves to live and to carry their memories with him forever (\"Those You've Known\").\n\nLed by Ilse, everyone assembles onstage to sing about how although the adults may still call the shots with their uptight views, they will not last forever, and the seeds are already being planted for a new, more open-minded and informed generation (\"The Song of Purple Summer\").",

The film received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $16.5 million against a $25 million budget.",
        "synopsis": "In San Francisco , 1959, four despondent strangers embark on the same night trolleybus : Penny, a single mother, regrets working the night shift and leaving her three children at home; Harrison, a would-be singer, has backed out of an important audition due to stage fright ; Julia leaves her waitressing job to seek out her boyfriend John, whose marriage proposal she rejected; and small-time thief Milo has just failed to retrieve a book of valuable stamps that he had conned out of a young boy. Their driver is Hal, who becomes distracted by an attractive passenger in another car and accidentally swerves the trolleybus off of an overpass , killing everyone aboard.\n\nAt the same time, Frank Reilly is driving his pregnant wife Eva to the hospital. Frank avoids the trolleybus just before it crashes. The Reillys are safe, but Eva delivers their baby in the car. Hal ascends into the next life , but the souls of the four passengers are \"attached\" to the newborn baby, Thomas, for reasons they do not understand. Only Thomas can see and hear them, and they are forced to follow him wherever he goes. As the years pass, the four grow to love Thomas, and he loves them. As Thomas grows older, however, his parents worry about his obsession with these \"invisible people\" and consider having him committed and getting divorced. Realizing their presence is hurting seven-year-old Thomas, the quartet decides to become invisible to him as well. The perceived abandonment causes young Thomas to avoid close relationships for the rest of his life, fearful that they, too, will leave him.\n\nTwenty-seven years later, Hal returns with his trolleybus. Because his irresponsibility ended four innocent lives, Hal has been condemned to convey spirits to the next life , and he has now come for his former passengers. The quartet learns that they've been with Thomas all these years because each of them died with unfinished business: Penny never found out what happened to her children, Harrison never conquered his fears and fulfilled his dream of public singing, Julia never told John her true feelings, and Milo never returned the stamp album, which would have freed him of the guilt from his life of crime. Thomas was meant to serve as their corporeal form, helping them to resolve their final business; if he refused to help, they were to inhabit his body and use it to solve their problems. After convincing Hal to buy some more time for them to rectify their unfinished lives, they reappear to Thomas, now a ruthless foreclosure banker who refuses to open up to his devoted girlfriend Anne.\n\nThomas, who has since undergone psychotherapy to convince himself that his \"imaginary friends\" were only a childhood delusion, initially believes their reappearance means he has had a psychotic break . Ignoring their pleas, he attempts to check himself into a psychiatric hospital , where a schizophrenic patient is able to describe the spirits that accompany him. This convinces Thomas that the spirits are real, but he is still angry with them for their abandonment and refuses to help them. The quartet convince him by leaping in and out of his body during an important meeting and threatening further public humiliation until Thomas reluctantly agrees to help in order to finally be rid of them.\n\nThomas is able to locate Penny's two daughters, but not her youngest child Billy, who was adopted after Penny's death. Milo uses Thomas's body to break into a house , steal back the stamp album , and return it to its now-adult owner. However, after the burglary, a nervous Thomas encounters a police sergeant (who is ticketing his illegally parked car) and accidentally gets himself arrested, forcing Anne to bail him out. Harrison uses Thomas's body to sing the national anthem at a B.B. King concert, after which Thomas is arrested again by the same police sergeant, who Penny suddenly recognizes as her son. Thomas tells Billy the location of his long-lost sisters, and Billy is so overcome that he lets Thomas go with a warning. Meanwhile, Anne, concerned with Thomas's recent bizarre behavior, demands to know what's going on. When he is unable to tell her, she breaks up with him.\n\nFinally, Thomas and Julia write a letter to Julia's boyfriend John in which she confesses her love for him, only to learn from a man now living in what was John's house that John died several years before. At the same moment, the trolleybus returns to take Julia. Thomas protests that Julia's business is still unresolved, but, while Thomas is busy berating Hal, Julia realizes that her true business is Thomas, who is making the same mistake with Anne that she made with John. Thomas promises her that he will tell Anne his true feelings before it is too late. Before she departs, Julia temporarily becomes solid again, allowing her to give Thomas a farewell hug.\n\nThomas invites Anne back to the arboretum, where he admits his fear of abandonment and his love for her. As a symbol of his trust, he gives her a heart-shaped keyring containing all his personal keys. Anne forgives him. The two dance under the night sky where four new stars twinkle to show that Penny, Julia, Harrison and Milo are finally at peace.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe musical opens in the workhouse, as the half-starved orphan boys are entering the enormous dining hall for supper. They are fed only gruel , but find some solace by imagining a richer menu (\"Food Glorious Food\"). Oliver gathers up the courage to ask for more, and is immediately apprehended by parish beadle Mr. Bumble and the Widow Corney, the heartless and greedy caretakers of the workhouse (\" Oliver! \"). Mr. Bumble and Widow Corney are left alone, and Mr. Bumble begins to make amorous advances (\"I Shall Scream!\"). Mrs. Corney pretends to resent his attentions, but ends up on Mr. Bumble's lap, as he eventually proposes to her. Mr. Bumble then takes Oliver and sells him as an apprentice to an undertaker, Mr. Sowerberry (\"Boy for Sale\"). Mr. Sowerberry and his wife taunt Oliver and Mr. Bumble (\"That's Your Funeral\"), causing Mr. Bumble to become angry and storm out. Oliver is sent to sleep in the basement with the coffins (\" Where Is Love? \").\n\nThe next morning, Noah Claypole, another employee of Mr. Sowerberry, insults Oliver's dead mother, whereupon Oliver begins pummeling him. Mrs. Sowerberry and her daughter, Charlotte, who is also Noah's girlfriend, run in. The three lock Oliver inside a coffin, and Mr. Bumble is sent for. The entrance of an intoxicated Mr. Sowerberry doesn't aid matters, and during all the commotion Oliver escapes. After a week on the run, he ends up in the city of London and meets a boy about 16 years old known as the Artful Dodger . Dodger seems a kindly boy, and welcomes Oliver to join him and his friends (\" Consider Yourself \"). Dodger is, unknown to Oliver, a pickpocket , and invites Oliver to come and live in Fagin 's lair. Fagin is a veteran criminal \" fence \" who sends out young boys as pickpockets. Oliver is completely unaware of any criminality and believes that the boys make handkerchiefs rather than steal them. Oliver is introduced to Fagin and his boys and taught their ways (\" You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two \").\n\nThe next day, Oliver meets Nancy , an older member of Fagin's gang and the girlfriend of Fagin's terrifying associate Bill Sikes , a brutal house- burglar whose abuse she endures because she loves him. Nancy, along with her good friend Bet and the boys sing about how they mostly like their unconventional if dangerous lifestyle (\"It's a Fine Life\"). Oliver bows deeply to Nancy and Bet, trying to be polite. All the boys laugh and mimic Oliver. Nancy singles out Dodger to demonstrate the way the rich people treat each other (\" I'd Do Anything \"). Nancy and Bet leave, and Oliver is sent out with the other boys on his first pickpocketing job (\" Be Back Soon \"). Fagin tells Oliver to go with Dodger and another boy named Charley Bates , but when Dodger and Charley steal a handkerchief from Mr. Brownlow , a wealthy old man, they run off, leaving the horrified Oliver to be arrested for the crime (\"The Robbery\").\n\n### Act II\n\nIn the Three Cripples pub, at the request of boisterous customers, Nancy strikes up an old tavern song with the low-life ruffians, (\" Oom-Pah-Pah \"). Bill Sikes makes his first appearance and disperses the crowd (\"My Name\"). Dodger runs in and tells Fagin about Oliver's capture and removal to the Brownlow household. Worried that Oliver will \"blow upon them\" (i.e. betray the gang to the authorities), Fagin and Bill decide to abduct Oliver and bring him back to the den, with Nancy's help. Nancy, who has come to care for Oliver, at first refuses to help, but Bill physically abuses her and forces her into obedience. In spite of this, Nancy still loves Bill and believes he loves her too (\" As Long as He Needs Me \").\n\nThe next morning, at Mr. Brownlow's house in Bloomsbury, Mrs. Bedwin, the housekeeper, sings to Oliver (\"Where Is Love? [Reprise]\"), and Oliver wakes up as street-sellers begin their day's work outside (\"Who Will Buy?\"). Mr. Brownlow and Dr. Grimwig decide that Oliver is well enough to go outside, so Brownlow sends Oliver to return some books to the bookseller. Oliver sees a group of street vendors and joins them in song (\"Who Will Buy? [Reprise]\"). As the vendors leave, Nancy and Bill appear and grab Oliver. They bring him back to Fagin's den, where Nancy saves Oliver from a beating from Sikes after the boy tries to flee. Nancy remorsefully reviews their dreadful life, but Bill maintains that any living is better than none while Fagin tries to smooth things over (\"It's A Fine Life [Reprise]\"). Left alone, Fagin ponders his current existence and possible life changes (\"Reviewing the Situation\"); however, after thinking of various excuses, he elects to stay just as he is.\n\nBack at the workhouse, Mr. Bumble and the Widow Corney, now unhappily married, are told by the dying pauper Old Sally that Oliver's mother, Agnes, left a gold locket when she died in childbirth. Old Sally had stolen the locket, which she gives to the Widow Corney before she dies. Mr. and Mrs. Bumble realize that Oliver may have wealthy relatives (\"Oliver! [Reprise]\") and visit Mr. Brownlow (who has advertised for news of Oliver), hoping to profit from any reward given for information. Mr. Brownlow realizes they are not interested in Oliver's welfare but only money and throws them out. Recognizing the picture inside the locket as a picture of his daughter, he realizes that Oliver is actually his grandson.\n\nNancy visits Mr. Brownlow, explains how she and Bill abducted Oliver, and remorsefully promises to deliver Oliver to him safely that night on London Bridge but refuses to give up her fellow gang members. She ponders again about Bill (\"As Long as He Needs Me [Reprise]\"). Suspecting Nancy, Bill follows her as she sneaks Oliver out of Fagin's den. At London Bridge, he confronts them and viciously clubs Nancy to death. He then grabs Oliver and runs off. Mr. Brownlow arrives and discovers Nancy's body. A large crowd forms, among them the distraught Bet. Bullseye, Bill's terrier , turns on his master and returns to the scene of the crime, and the crowd prepares to follow him. After Sikes brings Oliver to Fagin's hideout looking for aid, Fagin and his boys flee in panic. The constables break in, and Dodger is arrested before he can escape. Not finding Bill at the hideout, the crowd returns to the Thames Embankment . Bill appears at the top of the bridge, holding Oliver as hostage and threatening to kill him. When a memory of the dead Nancy freezes Sikes, two policemen sneak up on him, and one of them shoots Bill while the other grabs Oliver. After Oliver is reunited with Mr. Brownlow, the mob disperses. Fagin appears and decides that the time has never looked better for him to straighten out his life (\"Reviewing the Situation [Reprise]\").",

        "description": "Reefer Madness is a musical satire of the 1936 cult classic propaganda film of the same name . With book and lyrics by Kevin Murphy and book and music by Dan Studney, the musical debuted in Los Angeles in 1998.",
        "synopsis": "This synopsis reflects the current version of the show as licensed. For information about other versions of the show, and cut songs, see below.\n\n### Act I\n\nThe year is 1936. As the play opens, the Lecturer, a stern, conservative authority figure, informs a group of parents (the audience) of the new drug menace, \" marihuana \", which threatens the American way of life. (His warnings are reinforced by the Placard Girl, who throughout the play holds up large signs that clearly state scenes' moral lessons.) From his podium, the Lecturer warns the audience that action must be taken immediately before the children of America succumb to the Demon Weed (\"Reefer Madness\"). The Lecturer illustrates his point by re-enacting \"the Harper Affair\", which he claims is a true and horrific scandal. He begins by introducing us to Jimmy Harper and Mary Lane, a lovable pair of wholesome teens who hold hands, sip hot cocoa, and think pure thoughts while studying Shakespeare for English class (\"Romeo and Juliet\").\n\nThe Lecturer then shows us the seamier side of life at the Reefer Den, populated by drug-addled denizens. We meet Mae, the Reefer Den hostess, who is abused by her slick, pusher boyfriend Jack. She'd leave him, but Jack keeps her supplied with the marijuana she craves (\"The Stuff\"), despite his physical and sexual abuse.\n\nThe Lecturer brings us now to the five and dime , a local teen hangout where wholesome kids indulge in the risqu\u00e9 rhythms of swing-jazz music, as performed by Duke Ellington , Dizzy Gillespie , and other \"ginger-colored agents of evil\" (\"Down at the Ol' Five and Dime\"). The Lecturer assumes the guise of kindly Mr. Poppy, the singing and dancing proprietor.\n\nJack, trawling for youthful victims, arrives at the five and dime, where he meets Jimmy and lures him back to the Reefer Den under the pretense of offering him swing dancing lessons. There, Jimmy encounters Ralph, a psychotic ex-college student who communicates primarily with cackling, maniacal laughter. He also meets Sally, a marijuana-addicted prostitute who works to support herself and her baby. Jimmy is pressured into taking his first hit of marijuana (\"Jimmy Takes a Hit\") and tastes the forbidden fruits of sensual abandon in a wild hallucinatory dance sequence featuring weird sex, belly dancers, fire eaters, and Goat-Man, a frightening satyr played by the Lecturer (\"The Orgy\").\n\nOver the next few weeks, we watch Jimmy make a terrifying transition from \"good egg\" to \"bad apple\". He mouths off to his parents, brutalizes a puppy, and even attempts to tongue-kiss a shocked Mary, sending her running off in tears. Alone in church, Mary prays that her sweetheart will regain his senses and return to her (\"Lonely Pew\").\n\nLater, Jimmy and Ralph break into the church to steal from the poor box. While Ralph goes off to smoke some frankincense , Jimmy receives a  vision of Jesus Christ ! Jesus (played by Jack) warns Jimmy (in a Tom Jones -style production number) to kick his reefer habit or suffer eternal damnation (\"Listen to Jesus, Jimmy\"), but Jimmy ultimately refuses to heed Jesus's warning.\n\nBack at the Reefer Den, Jimmy is completely out of control. A desperate Mae warns Jimmy to avoid her own mistakes \u2013 he must escape the Reefer Den while he is still able. The drug-addled Jimmy won't listen. Even the revelation that Sally has sold her baby for drug money fails to snap him out of it. Sally's baby (played by Ralph) appears and sings a plaintive solo (\"Lullaby\").\n\nJimmy's misbehavior culminates with his stealing Mary's Packard and taking it for a reckless, marijuana-induced joyride with Sally. His joy, however, proves short-lived \u2013 Sally, who is driving, runs over a helpless old man crossing the street, killing him.\n\nFinally regaining his senses, Jimmy returns the stolen Packard to Mary's house and apologizes to her, pledging his love (\"Mary Jane/Mary Lane\".) Before he can give her his school ring as a token of his undying love, a siren sounds in the distance. Jimmy, now wanted for a hit-and-run , realizes that he must get far away from Mary lest he bring her down with him. He runs off into the night with no explanation. Mary doesn't know the exact nature of Jimmy's demons, but she vows he will not face them alone. She drives her Packard into the night in search of \"her poor lost Romeo\".\n\nMeanwhile, back at the Reefer Den, Jack and Mae hear a radio broadcast announcing the hit-and-run accident. Police are looking for a young man in a late-model Packard. Jack, fearing Jimmy will be arrested and lead the cops back to him, grabs a pistol and ominously vows to bring Jimmy back to the Reefer Den \"one way or another\" (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n### Act II\n\nAs the act begins, hallucinatory visions of Ralph, Sally and Mae appear as Jazz Trio Backup Girls (\"Jimmy on the Lam\"). The Lecturer brings us up to date \u2013 Jimmy's on the lam and Mary's \"combing the rain-spattered streets in search of her wayward young man.\" Jimmy arrives at the local train station and attempts to purchase a one-way ticket for \"Parts Unknown\".\n\nBefore Jimmy can board the train, Jack appears and tries to convince Jimmy to return to the Reefer Den with him. Jimmy refuses; he promised himself he'd never smoke marijuana again. Jack tricks Jimmy by offering him a seemingly innocent brownie . Jimmy thinks this is the best brownie he's ever eaten in his life. The train station patrons join him in a song extolling the many virtues of said brownie (\"The Brownie Song\"). Jimmy is hooked once again.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary makes inquiries at the five and dime. Kindly Mr. Poppy provides Mary with the address of the Reefer Den. The naive Mary leaves, grateful for Mr. Poppy's assistance. As soon as Mary is out of earshot, Mr. Poppy telephones the Reefer Den and tells Ralph to inform Jack that an unsuspecting new \"client\" is on her way over. We learn that Mr. Poppy is secretly on Jack's payroll. He helps Jack \"trundle little children off to pay the wages of sin\" (\"Five and Dime\" reprise).\n\nBack at the Reefer Den, Sally drags Jimmy upstairs for a weed-whacked sexual liaison. When Mary arrives looking for Jimmy, the lecherous Ralph is lying in wait. He tries to seduce Mary by tricking her into smoking marijuana herself (\"Little Mary Sunshine\"). The plan backfires \u2013 the power of the weed is so great, it immediately transforms the virginal Mary into a whip-cracking sadomasochist who enslaves the frightened Ralph. Upon discovering Mary and Ralph in a compromising position, a smoke-addled Jimmy attacks Ralph. A scuffle ensues. Jimmy is knocked unconscious and Jack accidentally shoots Mary through the heart. The villainous Jack places the gun in the unconscious Jimmy's hand. Jimmy, who remembers nothing, is convinced that he has murdered his beloved \"Juliet\". Mary regains consciousness long enough for Jimmy to finally give her his school ring. She dies in his arms (\"Mary's Death\").\n\nAs the police pull up in front of the house, Mae tells Jimmy that he's innocent of the crime and that Jack is planning to frame him. A police inspector (played by the Lecturer) bursts in. Jack accuses Jimmy of murdering Mary while \"hopped up\" on reefer. Jimmy begs Mae to tell the truth and exonerate him. Mae, however, is too weak and too dependent on the \"stuff\" Jack gives her. She remains silent and Jimmy is dragged away to stand trial.\n\nA few weeks later. Ralph, Mae, and Sally are racked with guilt as they listen to Winchell announce Jimmy Harper's conviction and death sentence. Ralph, who has been smoking non-stop, is becoming seriously unhinged. He sees hallucinatory visions: the ghost of doomed Jimmy, dead Mary in Hell being sodomized by the Devil, and the zombie remnants of all the kids destroyed by reefer. Imaginary reefer vines drop from the ceiling, ensnaring him. All the while, Ralph, stricken with a severe case of the munchies , moans about starving to death. Fearing that Ralph's insane caterwauling will prompt a neighbor to call the cops, Jack and Mae leave to get Ralph something to eat. Sally is instructed to remain behind and keep Ralph quiet. When Jack and Mae return with Chinese food, they catch Ralph in the act of gnawing on Sally's severed arm \u2013 he has eaten Sally alive! Ralph, now a cackling reefer-fueled cannibal, turns on Mae and Jack. Jack shoots Ralph repeatedly. He dies laughing. The shock of all this causes Mae's mind to snap \u2013 she's surrounded by the angry visions of Ralph, Sally, Mary, Goat-Man, Jimmy, and the Zombies (\"Murder!\"). Jack warns the unhinged Mae that the world is kill or be killed; \"the winner is the last one left alive.\"\n\nMae decides the only way to find inner peace is to turn herself in and save Jimmy from the electric chair. Jack tries to bring Mae back to her senses in his usual fashion \u2013 by giving her a smoke. Mae stubs it out. An angry Jack slaps her for wasting \"half a jay of good mootah\". Mae reacts with cold fury and picks up a hoe from the victory garden . Frightened by Mae's intensity, Jack tries to shoot her \u2013 alas, he expended all his bullets on Ralph! Mae sings as she slashes Jack with the garden hoe, avenging the deaths of Sally, Ralph, Mary, and every other poor kid Jack has ever hooked on marijuana (\"The Stuff\" reprise). Fountains of blood spray over the stage. Finally, Mae runs off to save Jimmy.\n\nMeanwhile, in an execution chamber, Jimmy walks the last mile and is strapped into the electric chair . Just as the Switch-Puller (played by Ralph) prepares to fry Jimmy, he is interrupted by a second visit from Jesus and his backup angels! They sing and dance (\"Listen to Jesus, Jimmy\" reprise). Jimmy's immense relief is short-lived. It turns out Jesus has only come to gloat and watch the execution. Jimmy prepares to meet his fate \u2013 when a second interruption occurs.\n\nThis time it is Mae who has obtained a presidential pardon . President FDR (played by the Lecturer) orders Jimmy to warn other children to beware the dangers of reefer. The President promises Jimmy plenty of help getting the message out. The government will use the power of radio, the papers of William Randolph Hearst , and powerful iconography: Uncle Sam , George Washington , and Lady Liberty (played by Ralph, Jack and Sally respectively). That Patriotic Trio joins the group in a rousing production number, chock-full of American iconography (\"Tell 'Em the Truth\"). During the song, Jimmy leads the townspeople back to the Reefer Den and builds a gigantic bonfire to immolate bales of marijuana and other \"dangerous items\". Mary appears dressed as an angel, freed from Hell by Jimmy's heroic destruction of property, and ascends to heaven while vowing to wait in Heaven for Jimmy until his death. The crowd sings:\n\nThe triumphant Lecturer comments:\n\n(\"The Truth\" Reprise)",

        "synopsis": "The main points of the story coincide with the Discovery album. On an alien planet in a city populated by blue-skinned humanoids, keyboardist Octave, guitarist Arpegius, drummer Baryl, and bass guitarist Stella are playing to a packed audience in a stadium, broadcast around the whole planet. A military force from Earth invades the planet and kidnaps most of the band members. Although Arpegius escapes, he too, is captured when a trooper shoots him with a tranquilizer dart .\n\nShep, a space pilot, is seen daydreaming about Stella while working on his guitar-shaped ship. Interrupted by a distress call about the kidnapping, he pursues the culprits through a wormhole and crash lands on Earth.\n\nMeanwhile, the band is taken to an underground facility where their memories are transferred into disks and replaced with fake memories, and their blue skin is changed to make them resemble humans. They are fitted with mind-control devices hidden inside sunglasses . Their captor, Earl de Darkwood, poses as their manager and presents them as a new band, The Crescendolls, who quickly become very popular. The fame has its disadvantages as the exhausted members of the band are forced to sign large amounts of publicity material. Meanwhile, Shep finds his way to the city and discovers what has happened to the band.\n\nShep flies into a Crescendolls stadium concert with a jet pack and fires a beam at each band member, freeing all of them from the mind control except Stella, who is blocked by Earl de Darkwood. During the escape, Shep is mortally wounded by Darkwood's robotic bodyguards.\n\nStill under Darkwood's control, Stella finds a card with the address of Darkwood's home, Darkwood Manor, which she hides in her dress. She is then taken to an awards ceremony where the Crescendolls win the Gold Record, a coveted music award. Baryl, concealed in the audience, frees Stella with the beam, and they escape with Octave's help. The band returns to Shep, who reveals their true identities and his feelings for Stella before he dies. They bury him, and his spirit rises into space. Driving away in a stolen van, they use the card Stella took earlier to travel to Darkwood Manor.\n\nWhile exploring Darkwood Manor, the band discovers a secret room, where they find a journal revealing Darkwood's plans entitled Veridis Quo . He has been kidnapping alien musicians from various worlds and passing them off as human musicians in order to acquire 5,555 Gold Records, with which he can rule the universe. While the band is reading the book, Darkwood appears with a group of cloaked devotees and captures them. He attempts to sacrifice Stella to complete the ritual required to unlock the Gold Records' power, but the band manages to defeat his robotic henchman. Arpegius throws the final Gold Record into a lava-filled chasm. Darkwood follows it into the abyss, apparently dying as a result. His followers accompany him, resulting in their deaths as well. Following this, Darkwood Manor collapses in on itself. The band narrowly escapes and visits their record company's headquarters to retrieve their memory disks. Octave sneaks in to steal them, but he is tased by a guard while escaping the building, and his skin reverts to its true natural blue color.\n\nThe authorities find Shep's ship along with Veridis Quo and mount an operation to restore the Crescendolls' true original memories and send them back to their home planet via the same wormhole that Shep used. As they enter the wormhole, the spirit of Darkwood appears and attacks their ship. Shep's spirit also appears and defeats Darkwood, freeing them. The band returns to their home planet to great acclaim, performing in the stadium which is broadcast around the universe, and a statue of Shep is erected in the city park.\n\nAt the film's end, it is implied that the whole story was the dream of a young boy who is a Daft Punk fan, inspired by the Discovery album and toys, including the Daft Punk merchandise in his room.",

        "synopsis": "Quirky Daisy Gamble sees herself as an unremarkable person and has low self-esteem, even though she can (1) make plants grow remarkably, (2) predict when a telephone will ring or someone will drop in, and (3) tell where to find an object that someone else is looking for. Her current problem, though, is her nasty smoking habit, which will interfere with the chances of her fianc\u00e9, Warren, for a job with great benefits. She seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Bruckner, to stop smoking. When he hypnotizes her, she describes living a previous life in late 18th century England as \"Melinda Wells\", who died in her late twenties from circumstances beyond her control. Free spirited Melinda was in love with portrait painter Edward Moncrief.  Mark keeps to himself what Daisy has revealed to him, and he tells her that she should not be ashamed of her ESP .\n\nAt their next session, Daisy, under hypnosis, relates scenes from the salacious London Hellrakers' Club where Melinda met Edward. Melinda and Edward eventually marry, but the painter is unfaithful to her, making love to his subjects. Mark finds himself falling for \"Melinda\" and becomes convinced that Daisy is really the reincarnation of Melinda. Melinda finally leaves Edward and sets sail for America, but the ship never reaches Boston.  Before Mark can save Melinda from shipwreck, Daisy wakes up.\n\nMark reports on the case to his fellow psychiatrists, who ridicule his findings. Greek shipping magnate Themistocles Kriakos learns of Mark's belief in reincarnation and offers to finance a study of the events of Melinda's life in exchange for Mark's help in discovering who he will be in his next life, which will allow him to leave his fortune to his future self. Daisy accidentally discovers that she is the \"Melinda\" at the center of the growing controversy and that Mark prefers Melinda to herself. In her angry confrontation with the psychiatrist about the matter, she tells him that she is \"through being a go-between for you and your dream girl. You're not going to go on using my head for a motel.\"\n\nDaisy goes to the airport, ready to return home. Her ESP powers warn her that the plane on which she plans to travel will crash.  She realizes at last how special she really is. She leaves her starchy fianc\u00e9 and she and Mark unite to explore their extraordinary future.",

        "title": "The Hobbit (1977 film)",
        "description": "The Hobbit is a 1977 animated musical television special created by Rankin/Bass and animated by Topcraft . The film is an adaptation of the 1937 book of the same name by J. R. R. Tolkien ; it was first broadcast on NBC in the United States on Sunday, November 27, 1977. The teleplay won a Peabody Award ; the film received a Christopher Award .\n\nThe New York Times found the film \"curiously eclectic\", but felt that whatever its failings, it warranted attention. The Tolkien scholar Douglas A. Anderson called the adaptation \"execrable\"; the author Baird Searles called it an \"abomination\" and an attempt that had \"failed miserably\", regretting the quality of the animation and of the soundtrack, and the omission of key plot points.",
        "synopsis": "A hobbit named Bilbo Baggins lives in his hobbit-hole. The wizard Gandalf informs him he is looking for someone to share an adventure, and introduces thirteen dwarves led by Thorin Oakenshield . They invite themselves in, eat dinner, and play music. The magic in the music makes Bilbo suddenly long for adventure.\n\nThorin explains Bilbo is to be a lucky number fourteen for them, and tells how his dwarves were driven out of the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug , who stole their treasure. Gandalf accepts the mission before the hobbit can speak.\n\nThe company discovers a camp of three trolls , who capture all but Gandalf and Bilbo. Bilbo hides while Gandalf uses his magic to bring the sunrise, which turns the trolls to stone. In the troll's cave, Bilbo discovers some stolen treasure, which the dwarves claim. They find two swords, and a dagger for Bilbo. Gandalf shows Thorin a map of the Lonely Mountain and a key, given to him by Thorin's father Thrain. The map shows a secret passage.\n\nTravelling through the Misty Mountains , everyone but Gandalf are captured by goblins . Gandalf kills the Great Goblin, and the dwarves escape. Bilbo loses the group; he finds an underground lake, where he discovers a ring , and meets the monster Gollum , who engages in a series of riddles with him in an attempt to hunt him. Bilbo, discovering the ring grants invisibility, follows Gollum to the door, and escapes.\n\nThe goblins, riding Wargs , pursue the company into a pine forest, setting it ablaze. The Lord of the Eagles rescues the company, and carries them to Mirkwood ; Gandalf leaves. Bilbo and the dwarves are captured by giant spiders, but Bilbo puts on his ring and drives off the spiders with his dagger. The dwarves are apprehended by the wood elves. Bilbo evades them using his ring. After weeks of searching, Bilbo pilfers a sleeping guard's keys, and floats the dwarves in barrels down the river into Laketown .\n\nThe people of Laketown nurse the company back to health. The fourteen reach the Lonely Mountain, and follow the map's instructions to enter. Bilbo goes in first, and meets Smaug, using the ring to hide. He and Smaug converse; the dragon assumes Bilbo must be a Laketowner. Bilbo discovers a patch of skin on Smaug not covered by protective scales. When Smaug attacks him for stealing, he escapes, mocking the dragon. Enraged, Smaug flies off to take revenge on Laketown. Bilbo sends a thrush to tell Bard about the bare patch, and Bard shoots Smaug down with his family's black arrow. Smaug destroys Laketown in his death throes.\n\nThe Dwarves reclaim their treasure, only to find that the Lakemen and the Elves have arrived, wanting recompense for Smaug's many damages over the years. Thorin refuses to share, and declares war. Bilbo rebukes him, as they are outnumbered; Thorin is angered. Thorin's cousin, Dain, brings more dwarves. Gandalf arrives, warning that the Goblins are coming. Men, elves, and dwarves unite, and Bilbo uses his ring to hide as battle rages. The Eagles join the fight.\n\nBilbo finds a wounded Bombur who informs him that the battle has been won. Only seven of the thirteen dwarves are left. Bilbo is led by Gandalf to the dying Thorin, who forgives him. Bilbo accepts two small chests of gold and his dagger as payment. Gandalf escorts him home. Gandalf warns him that the adventure is only just beginning, thanks to the ring he has found.",

The episode is a musical with a book by James Goldman and lyrics and music by Stephen Sondheim . It is based on a John Collier short story published in the 1951 collection Fancies and Goodnights . The story was originally published in 1940.\n\nWritten originally for television, the musical focuses on Charles ( Anthony Perkins ), a poet who takes refuge from the world by hiding out in a department store after closing.  He meets a community of night people who live in the store and falls in love with a beautiful young girl named Ella ( Charmian Carr ).  Bizarre complications arise when the leader of the group forbids their relationship.",

Once there he finds a secret group who have lived in the store for years. The leader of the group, Mrs. Monday, permits Charles to stay after he convinces her that he is a poet.\n\nCharles meets and is smitten with a beautiful young girl, Ella Harkins, Mrs. Monday's maid. Ella, who is now 19, has lived in the store since she was separated from her mother at age six, falling asleep in the women's hat department. Ella is unhappy and wants to leave, but is afraid of the \"Dark Men.\" Should someone try to return to the outside world and risk revealing the group's existence, the Dark Men take them away and another mannequin appears in the clothing department.\n\nCharles realizes Ella has not seen the sun for thirteen years. Ella tries to tell Charles about her life before, but realizes that most of her memories from outside are being replaced with memories of living in the store (\"I Remember\"). Charles has fallen in love with Ella; as he plays cards with members of the group, he has a quiet duet with Ella (\"When\"). Ella finally decides to leave with Charles (\"Take Me to the World\").  Charles is initially reluctant to leave his now-comfortable life, but then understands that he loves Ella more than poetry. Mrs. Monday and the others hear their plans, and they call the Dark Men, as Ella and Charles try to escape.\n\nThe store opens the next morning with a couple on the sidewalk who resemble Ella and Charles from behind, but turn out to be strangers when the camera pans to their faces. They're looking at a window display in which Ella and Charles are now mannequins dressed as a bride and groom, with the night watchman acting as their minister.",

The show featured stunning choreography in traditional Flamenco style by Rafael Aguilar , and the show won an Olivier Award as a result. Several dancers were cast directly from Spain, making their West End debuts. The bulls for the fighting sequences were performed by a phalanx of black-clad dancers, moving as one.\n\nThe work began life in 1987 as a concept album , starring Tom Jones . Jones was keen to play the lead on stage, and gave up his Las Vegas cabaret shows to return to the UK for that purpose. The musical was initially unable to attract the financial backing required, but Jones did get his first UK top ten hit after a fifteen-year dry spell, with his single, A Boy From Nowhere , lifted from the Matador concept album. The follow-up single \"I Was Born to Be Me\" peaked at No. 61 in January 1988.\n\nEventually financial backing was secured, and the show opened at the Queen's Theatre in London on April 16, 1991. Audiences and most critics were positive [ citation needed ] , but the 1991 London theatre season was heavily impacted by the Persian Gulf War and the subsequent drop in tourism. The production folded after three months. The London production starred John Barrowman as Domingo Hernandez and Stefanie Powers as American actress Laura Jane Wilding, a character based on actress Ava Gardner . Nicky Henson and Caroline O'Connor costarred.\n\nAfter the failure of the London production, the authors returned to America and made revisions to the book and score during productions in regional and college theatres.",

        "synopsis": "At the Edinburgh Castle Gin Palace, a drinking establishment in the East End of London , a local girl, who is on very familiar terms with the male clientele, sings of her exploits (\"Twice in Love\"). The intellectual and driven Barnardo finds himself out of place with the Cockneys of the Edinburgh Castle, and a row among them ensues (\"A Very Busy Man\"). As a result, Barnardo is thrown out of the tavern, as is Syrie Elmslie, who was attempting to collect money for charity. Outside the tavern, Johnny Farthingay, the son of the landlady, assures his girlfriend Jenny that although he can't buy her expensive presents, their love will keep them together. Jenny is a bit more cynical (\"Love Is Here\").\n\nBarnardo reflects on the course his life is taking (\"A Strange and Lovely Song\"). While wandering London's streets, he encounters two homeless children who take him to the rooftops where they live, and it is there Barnardo learns of their struggle to survive (\"The Likes of Us\"). Barnardo is troubled by the conditions in which the children live. He decides he is needed far more in his own country than in China and resolves to stay in London to help the poor children (\"How Am I to Know\"). Unfortunately, his efforts to help only serve to stir a sense of outrage in the local populace who feel he is meddling in their affairs (\"We'll Get Him\").\n\nUndaunted, Barnardo seeks the aid of Lord Shaftesbury. He accepts that his chosen mission will isolate him spiritually from those around him (\"A Man on His Own\"). Lord Shaftesbury is hosting a party in his home, at which Barnardo's fellow pub evictee Syrie also is a guest. Everyone joins in to sing the praises of England (\"Lion-Hearted Land\").  Lord Shaftesbury is won over by Barnardo and visits the children with him. Syrie also joins Barnardo's cause, and he is able to set up his first children's home, where he and Syrie care for the children (\"You Can Never Make It Alone\").\n\nThe tide turns, and Barnardo becomes overwrought with financial worries when he is sued for fraud. To make matters worse, a boy he was unable to help dies. Barnardo is in a state of despair, not knowing what will become of him (\"Where Am I Going\"), and the East End denizens hold an anti-Barnardo demonstration (\"Hold a March\"). Johnny and Jenny argue about their differing views of Barnardo. Johnny abandons Jenny, and Syrie attempts to console her (\"You Won't Care About Him Anymore\").\n\nBarnardo's fortunes take a dramatic turn for the better. When the Edinburgh Castle is placed up for auction, he decides to buy it, as his ownership will serve to silence his detractors, and the building can be converted to further his cause (\"Going, Going, Gone!\"). Barnardo and Syrie marry (\"Will This Last Forever?\"). Their union provides the spark for two of the children to pretend they too will be a couple (\"Man of the World\"). The wedding reception is held in Barnardo's new property, which has been converted into a tea and coffee establishment (\"Have Another Cup of Tea\"). Barnardo and Syrie put the children to bed.",

        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nIn 1808, the Tuck family, thirsty and traveling through a forest, comes across a spring and drinks of it. 85 years later, the area near the forest has developed into the town of Treegap, New Hampshire, and the characters sing about what they want most in the world: Winnie Foster, to go to the fair; Mae Tuck, to see her sons again; Jesse Tuck, to take in the familiar sights of Treegap; Miles Tuck, to be unstuck in time; and the Man in the Yellow Suit, to \"learn the secret\" of Treegap Wood and become immortal (\"Live Like This\").\n\nWinnie goes into her house, where she spends most of her time with her mother Betsy, and her grandmother. Betsy refuses to let Winnie leave the house, fearing she will suffer the same fate as Winnie's deceased father. Winnie wishes for a life bigger than their living room and wants to explore Treegap Wood (\"Good Girl, Winnie Foster\").\n\nAfter running outside once again, Winnie encounters a parade led by the Man in the Yellow Suit that leads to the fair (\"Join the Parade\"). Desperate to see the fair, Winnie Foster opens the gate and runs into the Wood after the faint sound of a music box (\"Good Girl, Winnie Foster (Reprise)\").\n\nThere she meets Jesse Tuck, who drinks from the spring. To keep her from doing the same, Jesse offers to show her what he calls the top of the world, as seen from the trees (\"Top of the World\"). After, he and Miles kidnap Winnie and bring her back to the Tucks' house to keep her from revealing their secret.\n\nBack at the Foster home, Betsy has called on Constable Joe and his son Hugo to search for Winnie (\"Hugo's First Case, Parts 1 and 2\").\n\nThe Tucks tell Winnie the history of the Tuck family (\"The Story of the Tucks\"), explaining that they had all stopped growing or aging the moment they drank from the spring , and because of the reactions of the townspeople, the boys now split up to avoid being recognized, travel the world, and only see each other once every ten years, with Angus and Mae maintaining the homestead on what is now the Fosters' land. Winnie stays the night with the Tucks and, while finding clothes for Winnie to wear, Mae tells her the story of the day when her husband, Angus proposed to her (\"My Most Beautiful Day\"). Winnie decides that staying in the Tuck family's attic is its own kind of adventure (\"The Attic\"). Still, she eventually decides to sneak out with Jesse to go to the fair (\"Join the Parade (Reprise)\").\n\nAt the fair, Winnie and Jesse play games and decide to become friends that travel the world together (\"Partner in Crime\"). The Man in the Yellow Suit attempts to guess Jesse's age and is shocked when he looks in Jesse's eyes. Jesse and Winnie leave the fair and sit on top of the Treegap water tower, where Jesse conceives a plan: allow Winnie to continue to grow for the next six years, then have her drink the water so they will be eternally the same age and they can marry (\"Seventeen\"). The Man in the Yellow Suit follows the Tucks to get to the enchanted water.\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe Man in the Yellow Suit celebrates his victory with those from the traveling fair (\"Everything's Golden\") and takes leave to pursue the water. Back at the Tucks' house, Winnie contemplates Jesse's proposal (\"Seventeen (Reprise)\").\n\nThe Tucks discover that Jesse has asked Winnie to drink the water and become angry with him. Winnie talks to Miles about his son Thomas; Miles recalls that his wife became horrified when she noticed the Tucks were not aging, left Miles, and took Thomas with her before he drank the water; Miles notes that he never saw Thomas again and does not know whether he is still alive (\"Time\"). The Tucks then lament what it means to be stuck in time forever, and aim to live more fully in the coming years (\"Time (Reprise)\").\n\nThe Man in the Yellow Suit blackmails the Fosters into signing over ownership of Treegap Wood (and the spring) to him in exchange for Winnie's safe return (\"Everything's Golden (Reprise)\"). Constable Joe and Hugo see the Man leaving the Foster home, and remark that you can not trust a man dressed in yellow (\"You Can't Trust a Man\").\n\nAngus takes Winnie fishing and attempts to convince her to live a mortal life instead of drinking the water with Jesse (\"The Wheel\"). Miles approaches and tells them that Jesse has gone without saying goodbye, and Winnie says they can find him at the spring in Treegap Wood. There, Jesse encounters the Man in the Yellow Suit who tells him of his long journey to find the spring and forces Jesse to take him there (\"The Story of the Man in the Yellow Suit\"). The Tucks and Winnie find Jesse, and the Man in the Yellow Suit offers to make them partners in his water-selling business. After the Man takes Winnie hostage, Jesse offers him a vial of water in exchange for her; before he can drink it, however, Mae strikes a fatal blow to the Man's head. When Constable Joe and Hugo arrive, Winnie tells them that she killed the Man in the Yellow Suit in self-defense.\n\nThe Tucks abandon the homestead and leave Treegap permanently on Constable Joe's advice. They say goodbye to Winnie and offer her their music box, thanking her for reminding them that there is \"still something to live for.\" Jesse says he will leave instructions on how to find him and leaves her with a vial of water from the spring. Winnie contemplates drinking the water and what it means to live forever (\"Everlasting\"). She ultimately decides to live out her mortal life and pours the water on her toad instead.\n\nThrough a ballet sequence, the ensemble shows the remainder of Winnie's life: she marries Hugo and has a son, to Jesse's disappointment. Each of Winnie's loved ones pass away one by one. Before she dies, Winnie opens the Tucks' music box and dances one last time at the gate of the Foster home as she did when she was young.\n\nThe Tucks return to Treegap after Winnie has died and visit her grave, which is dedicated to a \"cherished wife, devoted mother, and dearest grandmother.\" They celebrate the fact that she lived a full life and encounter the toad Winnie made immortal with the water from the spring (\"The Wheel (Reprise)\").",

The 2024 Broadway revival was nominated for 7 Tony Awards and won 3, including Best Revival of a Musical .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe place: A mansion on Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, 5 a.m. A homicide has been reported. Joe Gillis sets the scene (\"Prologue\"), noting that \"an old-time movie star is involved / Maybe the biggest star of all\", and that, if you want to know the \"real facts\", \"you've come to the right party.\"\n\nFlashback to... Hollywood, 1949 \u2013 where a down-on-his-luck screenwriter, Joe Gillis, is trying to hustle up some work at Paramount Studios (\"Let's Have Lunch\"). His appointment with a producer goes poorly when the executive rejects both Joe's proposed script and a loan to bring his car payments up to date. Joe does, however, meet Betty Schaefer, a pretty, young script editor who suggests they collaborate to rework one of his earlier screenplays (\"Every Movie's a Circus\"). As they chat, car repossession agents spot Joe, who quickly escapes.\n\nDuring the ensuing chase, Joe evades his pursuers by pulling in to the garage of a palatial but dilapidated mansion on Sunset Boulevard. Beckoned inside the house, Joe encounters Norma Desmond (\"Surrender\"), a star actress of the silent-film era. Taken aback, Joe comments, \"You used to be in pictures; you used to be big,\" to which Norma retorts, \"I am big \u2013 it's the pictures that got small!\" (\"With One Look\")\n\nThe gloomy estate is inhabited only by Norma and Max von Mayerling, her loyal butler and chauffeur. Although decades past her prime and mostly forgotten by the public, Norma is convinced she is as beautiful and popular as ever. Max perpetuates this illusion by shielding her from the realities of life out of the limelight and by writing her letters purportedly from still-devoted fans. Norma informs Joe that she plans to make her comeback with Salome , a script she has written for Cecil B. DeMille to direct with her in the starring role as the teenage biblical temptress (\"Salome\"). Dubious but sensing opportunity, Joe accepts her offer to work on editing the script. Norma insists that Joe stay in her home while they collaborate on Salome (\"The Greatest Star of All\").\n\nJoe immediately realizes the script is incoherent, but because Norma won't allow a major rewrite, the revision drags on for months. During this time Joe is virtually imprisoned within the house, but he does break away to fulfill his commitment to Betty. Their working relationship blossoms into a romance that has her reconsidering her engagement to Joe's best friend, Artie Green (\"Girl Meets Boy\").\n\nBlind to Joe's opportunism, Norma lavishes him with gifts that include a wardrobe makeover and he becomes her kept man (\"The Lady's Paying\"). She declares her love for him and turns quite possessive (\"The Perfect Year\"); when he leaves her to attend Artie's New Year's Eve party (\"This Time Next Year\"), she is distraught and attempts suicide. As a conciliatory gesture, Joe reluctantly returns to work on Salome .\n\n### Act II\n\nJoe is now living in luxury at Norma Desmond's mansion, for reasons he bluntly states are mercenary (\"Sunset Boulevard\"). A cryptic message from Paramount has Norma certain that DeMille is eager to discuss her script (\"There's Been A Call\"). She drops in on the set of his current film and is greeted warmly by former colleagues and the famed director himself, but he is non-committal about Salome (\" As If We Never Said Goodbye \"). Meanwhile, Max discovers the studio had called to ask about Norma's Isotta Fraschini , not her screenplay. However, a delusional Norma leaves the lot convinced she'll soon be back in front of the cameras and begins to prepare for the role (\"Eternal Youth Is Worth a Little Suffering\").\n\nIncreasingly paranoid, Norma deduces that Joe and Betty are more than just friends (\"Too Much in Love to Care\"). Max tells Joe of the depth of his commitment to protecting Norma from discovering the truth, revealing that he was Norma's first husband and has stayed with her all these years (\"New Ways to Dream\" (reprise)). She calls Betty to reveal Joe's secret life at the mansion, but he overhears and grabs the phone to tell Betty to come see for herself. Realizing their affair is doomed, Joe brusquely tells Betty he enjoys being Norma's pet and that she should go back to Artie. Betty departs, confused and heartbroken, and Joe tells Norma he is leaving her and returning to his hometown of Dayton, Ohio. He also bluntly informs her that Salome is an unfilmable script and her fans have long abandoned her.

        "synopsis": "The roaring '20s are still in high gear, and Berlin is the center of high life. Guests come and go at the opulent Grand Hotel, as cynical Doctor Otternschlag, who still suffers from World War I wounds, injects his morphine. Assistant concierge Erik, busy at the front desk, waits to hear of his son's birth; his wife is having a difficult labor. Baron Felix Von Gaigern, young, good-looking, and destitute, uses his charisma to help him secure a room in the overbooked hotel while stiffing a tough gangster who pretends to be a chauffeur. Aging Russian prima ballerina Elizaveta Grushinskaya arrives with her entourage, who tries to persuade her that she still can and must dance. Her confidante and dresser, Raffaela, knows that they would have to come up with a lot of money if the dancer failed to show up for her contracted engagements. Raffaela has feelings for Elizaveta.\n\nJewish bookkeeper Otto Kringelein, who is fatally ill, wants to spend his life's savings to live his final days at the hotel in the lap of luxury. The Baron helps him secure a room. Meanwhile, Hermann Preysing, the general manager of a failing textile mill, hears that the merger with a Boston company has been called off, spelling financial ruin; he does not want to lie to his stockholders but gives in to the pressure. He plans to go to Boston to try to revive the merger and presses his temporary secretary, Flaemmchen, to accompany him and \"take care of him\". She dreams of Hollywood stardom and fears she might be pregnant, but flirts with the Baron. She also agrees to a dance, at the Baron's suggestion, with the surprised and delighted Otto. Elizaveta suffers through another unsuccessful dance performance and rushes back to the hotel. She bursts into her room to find the Baron as he is about to steal her diamond necklace to pay back the gangster, but he pretends to be her biggest fan. The two fall in love and spend the night together. He agrees to go with her to Vienna so she can fulfill her dancing engagements, and they plan to marry; they will meet at the train station.\n\nTwo African-American entertainers, the Jimmys, sing at the bar and dance with Flaemmchen. Erik tries to get out of work so that he can join his wife at the hospital, but the unpleasant hotel manager, Rohna, refuses to give him any time off. The Baron has persuaded Otto to invest in the stock market, and Otto has made a killing in the market overnight. But Otto is not feeling well, and the Baron helps him to his room, resisting the temptation to steal his wallet. Otto rewards the Baron with some cash. The gangster confronts the Baron and directs him to steal Preysing's wallet; he gives the Baron a gun. Preysing has cornered Flaemmchen in their adjoining rooms and pressures her for sex. The Baron, who was in Preysing's room trying to steal his wallet, hears Flaemmchen's cries next door and walks into her room to defend her while still holding Preysing's wallet. After a struggle, Preysing kills the Baron with the gangster's gun. Preysing is arrested. Raffaela struggles with how to tell Grushinskaya that her lover is dead and ultimately decides not to, leaving Grushinskaya ecstatic to see him at the train station when she leaves.\n\nOtto offers to take Flaemmchen to Paris; he has plenty of money now, so they can enjoy the good life for as long as he has left, and she realizes she is fond of him. Erik has a son and learns that his wife gave birth just fine. Doctor Otternschlag observes: \"Grand Hotel, Berlin. Always the same \u2013 people come, people go \u2013 One life ends while another begins \u2013 one heart breaks while another beats faster \u2013 one man goes to jail while another goes to Paris \u2013 always the same. ...

Featuring the voices of Bobby Driscoll , Kathryn Beaumont , Hans Conried , Bill Thompson , Heather Angel , Paul Collins , Tommy Luske, Candy Candido , Tom Conway , Roland Dupreee and Don Barclay , the film's plot follows Wendy Darling and her two brothers, who meet the eternally-young Peter Pan and travel with him to the island of Never Land to stay young, where they also have to face Peter's archenemy, Captain Hook .\n\nIn 1935, Walt Disney began considering plans to adapt Barrie's play into an animated feature. He purchased the film rights from Paramount Pictures in 1938, and began preliminary development in the next year. However, following the attack on Pearl Harbor , Disney shelved the project when his studio was contracted by the United States government to produce training and war propaganda films. The project sat idle in development for the rest of the decade until it experienced a turnaround in 1949. To assist the animators, live-action reference footage was shot with actors on soundstages. It also marked the last Disney film in which all nine members of Disney's Nine Old Men worked together as directing animators.\n\nPeter Pan was released on February 5, 1953, becoming the final Disney animated feature released through RKO before Disney founded his own distribution company .

An irritated George demands that Wendy drop the stories and move out of the nursery, since \"sooner or later, people have to grow up\" and also chains Nana the female dog outside because she is a dog not a nurse. Later that night, Peter himself arrives in the nursery to find his lost shadow. He persuades Wendy to come to Never Land , where she will never have to grow up, and she and the boys fly there with the begrudging help of the pixie Tinker Bell .\n\nA ship of pirates is anchored off Never Land, led by Captain Hook and his first mate, Mr. Smee . Hook wants revenge on Peter for cutting off his hand, but fears the crocodile which consumed the hand, knowing it is eager to eat the rest of him. When Pan and the Darlings arrive, Hook shoots at them with a cannon, and Peter sends the Darlings off to safety while he baits the pirates. Tinker Bell, who is jealous of Pan's attention to Wendy, convinces the Lost Boys that Pan has ordered them to shoot down Wendy. Tinker Bell's treachery is soon found out, and Peter banishes her for a week. John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island's Natives ; however, the Natives capture the group, believing them to be responsible for taking the chief's daughter, Tiger Lily .\n\nMeanwhile, Peter takes Wendy to see the mermaids , who flee in terror when Hook arrives on the scene. Peter and Wendy see that Hook and Smee have captured Tiger Lily, to force her to disclose the location of Peter's hideout. Peter frees Tiger Lily and returns her to the Chief, and the tribe honors Peter. Meanwhile, Hook takes advantage of Tinker Bell's jealousy of Wendy, tricking the fairy into revealing Peter's secret hideout instead.\n\nWendy and her brothers eventually grow homesick and plan to return to London. They invite Peter and the Lost Boys to join them and be adopted by the Darlings. The Lost Boys agree, but Peter does not want to grow up and refuses. The pirates lie in wait, and capture the Lost Boys and the Darlings as they exit the lair, leaving behind a time bomb to kill Peter. Hook attempts to persuade his captives to join the crew, threatening to make them walk the plank if they refuse. Tinker Bell learns of the plot, just in time to snatch the bomb from Peter as it explodes.\n\nPeter rescues Tinker Bell from the rubble, and together they rescue Wendy, confronting the pirates and releasing the children. Peter engages Hook in combat as the children fight off the crew, and defeats him. Hook falls into the sea and swims away, pursued by the crocodile. Peter commandeers the deserted ship and, assisted by Tinker Bell's pixie dust, flies it to London with the children aboard although the Lost Boys choose to stay with Peter Pan in Neverland.\n\nGeorge and Mary Darling return home and find Wendy sleeping at the nursery's open window. Wendy awakens and excitedly tells about their adventures and that she's ready to grow up but her father who has softened up tells her she can stay in the nursery and even brings Nana back inside. The parents look out the window and see what appears to be a pirate ship in the clouds. George, recognizing the ship from his own childhood, hints that he himself went to Neverland when he was a boy.",

        "synopsis": "### Pre-Show\n\nPatchy the Pirate, SpongeBob's number one fan, and President of the SpongeBob fan club, sits on the stage after the audience has taken their seats. He reveals he has traveled from Encino, California , to record the musical on his phone and make a \" pirate copy \". Two security guards tell Patchy to leave, as the show is about to begin. Patchy objects but gets kicked out as he claims he is a victim of pirate discrimination and sings a protest chant, \"Yo ho, we won't go\". One of the guards apologizes, then tells the audience to enjoy the show. In the television special, this prologue is replaced by an animated segment about theatre etiquette.\n\n### Act One\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants awakens and welcomes the day with his pet sea snail, Gary (\"Bikini Bottom Day\"). He greets various friends in his hometown of Bikini Bottom\u2014including his best friend Patrick , his neighbor Squidward , and his friend Sandy Cheeks \u2014as he walks to the Krusty Krab restaurant. At work, his boss Mr. Krabs tells his daughter Pearl that she will manage the restaurant one day. With Pearl uninterested, SpongeBob hints at his desire to become the manager. Mr. Krabs laughs at the idea, telling SpongeBob he is \"just a simple sponge\" (\"Bikini Bottom Day\" (Reprise 1)). Then, a violent tremor suddenly rocks the entire town.\n\nNews reporter Perch Perkins reveals that the tremor was caused by the nearby Mount Humongous, a volcano that will soon erupt, throwing the town into a panic (\"No Control\"). SpongeBob cheers up an upset Patrick by reiterating that they are best friends forever (\"BFF\"). With the town in a panic over the impending doom, married villains Plankton and Karen try to convince the citizens to enter an escape pod that ensures safety\u2014a cover-up for their secret scheme to hypnotize the citizens in the pod into liking the chum that they serve at their restaurant, the Chum Bucket (\"When the Going Gets Tough\"). The townspeople, unknowingly, support this idea and decide to hold a last-minute music concert to raise enough money to build the pod. Squidward's idea of his one-man show is immediately shut down. Instead, Pearl suggests that a famous rock band, the Electric Skates, play at the concert. Everyone agrees and Squidward is named manager of the event. Despite Sandy's pleas that science could help them solve the problem, the townsfolk ignore her for being a land mammal.\n\nSpongeBob, however, is against the idea of leaving town and believes the citizens should save Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob thinks back on Mr. Krabs' words from earlier and wonders if he could save the town (\"(Just a) Simple Sponge\"). He goes to Patrick and Sandy for help. Mr. Krabs sees the upcoming disaster as a money-making opportunity, holding an \"apocalypse sale\". Pearl worries about her father's greed , believing that it overshadows his care for her (\"Daddy Knows Best\").\n\nMeanwhile, SpongeBob convinces Patrick and Sandy to team up, climb the volcano, and stop it from erupting with a bubble device Sandy will build. The friends are determined to succeed (\"Hero Is My Middle Name\"). Before they start their plan, a group of cultist sardines appear. They found wisdom in Patrick's thoughts at the town meeting and decide to make him their new leader (\"Super Sea Star Savior\"). Patrick likes the idea and decides to back out of SpongeBob's plan so that he can bask in self-glory, angering SpongeBob. The two argue and end their \"BFF\" status. After Patrick leaves, Sandy reminds SpongeBob that things are bound to be okay. The entire company reveals their personal thoughts and feelings about the impending disaster (\"Tomorrow Is\").\n\n### Act Two\n\nPatchy again sneaks onstage, telling the audience that pirates are persecuted by others because of stereotypes (\"Poor Pirates\"), supported in song by a group of pirates he met during the show's first act after wandering into a dive bar in the nearby Hell's Kitchen . (In the Chicago run, he stated he was \"walking around the Chicago Loop .\") The theater's security again intervenes to chase Patchy away as he screams that he'll be back.\n\nSpongeBob wakes up and greets a new day,  the day when the volcano is expected to erupt (\"Bikini Bottom Day\" (Reprise 2)). Bikini Bottom has fallen into anarchy and chaos: the mayor has employed a dictatorship over the people and an angry mob has started to hunt down Sandy, thinking her science is the cause for the volcano's impending eruption. Sandy hides from the mob and shows SpongeBob the ingenious bubble device, the Eruption Interrupter. They plan to throw it inside the volcano and save the town.\n\nBack in Bikini Bottom, Plankton worries that Sandy and SpongeBob will successfully climb up the mountain and save the town, but Karen tells him that she found his misplaced Avalanche Maker 3000, saying they can use it to create an avalanche to kill SpongeBob and Sandy. The Electric Skates finally arrive (\"Bikini Bottom Boogie\") and accept Squidward's request to join their opening act if Squidward buys every item on a long shopping list. Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Sandy make their way up the volcano with great difficulty, and Sandy tries to increase their morale, encouraging them to never give up (\"Chop to the Top\"). SpongeBob cannot help but think of how he misses Patrick and wishes he were there to help them. In Bikini Bottom, Patrick finds life as a guru unexciting and misses SpongeBob as well, prompting him to leave his followers behind to help SpongeBob (\"(I Guess) I Miss You\").\n\nSquidward obtains all but one of the items on the Electric Skates' list, so the band refuses his request and calls him a \"loser\". In response, Squidward, who was called a loser in his childhood, snaps back at the band in anger. As the band quits and leaves, Squidward insists that he is not a loser and performs a song with a tap dance number and backup chorus, but becomes depressed again when he realizes that it was all in his imagination (\"I'm Not a Loser\"). However, with the band gone, there is no concert or escape pod. Pearl suggests Mr. Krabs hand over his money to build the escape pod, but even he cannot meet the price, and the town's citizens panic and fight one another. Back on the mountain, Plankton and Karen use the avalanche maker to cause an avalanche, sending SpongeBob falling off the mountain. Patrick arrives and saves him with a jetpack Sandy invented, and the two reaffirm their friendship and follow Sandy to the summit of the mountain. When they reach the top, neither Sandy nor Patrick can reach the rim where they need to throw the device in. They turn to SpongeBob, who doubts his skills (\"(Just a) Simple Sponge\" (Reprise)). They remind him that he is the only one who can squeeze through tight areas and that his optimism has gotten them this far. His determination renewed, SpongeBob throws the Eruption Interrupter in. The three soon discover the chaos Bikini Bottom is in and immediately parachute down to the town to stop the fighting from escalating further.\n\nSpongeBob tries to calm everyone down, insisting that, despite whatever happens, they all have each other (\"Best Day Ever\"). When the time comes for the volcano to erupt, everyone braces for their potential deaths. However, time passes with no eruption, and bubbles fall from above, signaling that Sandy's invention worked. With Bikini Bottom safe, everyone apologizes for their behavior, as Plankton and Karen argue and accidentally reveal their secret plot. Mr. Krabs decides to have SpongeBob as the manager of the Krusty Krab someday. Everyone then decides that they should celebrate by having a new concert led by Pearl and Squidward, much to his delight, as Sandy is now welcomed back by the citizens of Bikini Bottom. Patchy descends from above on a rope, having finally managed to sneak into the show. He makes the cast reluctantly agree to let him be a part of the finale as the townspeople welcome the brand-new day (\"Bikini Bottom Day\" (Reprise 3)). During the curtain call, the cast performs one final song (\"'SpongeBob SquarePants' Theme Song\").",

tourists have departed, the witty Ruth Sherwood arrives in Greenwich Village with Eileen, her younger sister.\nThe two have just arrived from Columbus, Ohio , determined to forge a life in New York City as a writer (Ruth) and an actress (Eileen).\nSoon they are living in a basement apartment , recently vacated by Violet.\nTheir landlord is Mr. Appopoulos.\nTheir apartment building is shaken frequently by dynamite from the construction of a subway underneath them and they are disturbed by Violet's returning customers.\nThe sisters are soon stricken with homesickness for \"Ohio\".\n\nThe next morning, Ruth and Eileen set out to try their hand at \"Conquering New York\", only to find defeat and humiliation.\nEileen, at least, has gotten food from a food samples man, as well as Mr. Valenti, but has also met Frank Lippencott, a local Walgreens manager who has developed a crush on her.\nRuth, however, is left to wonder at her sister's magnetic appeal and her own unique romantic abilities \u2014 a talent for repelling men that is so successful that she could write a book entitled \"One Hundred Easy Ways to Lose a Man.\"\n\nEventually, Ruth talks her way into the offices of a short story magazine, where she meets Bob Baker.\nBob likes Ruth, but advises her that she has little chance of success, and  tells her flat out what a waste of money and time it was to come to New York City , because he along with many others have done the same thing (\"What a Waste\").\nUndaunted, Ruth leaves three stories with Bob in the hope that he will read them.\n\nMeanwhile, Eileen has been eating all of her lunches free at Walgreens, and finds herself infatuated with Frank (\"A Little Bit in Love\"), and invites him over to dinner so Ruth can have free lunches when she goes to Walgreens, too.\nBob arrives at the apartment, looking for Ruth, and Eileen invites him over for dinner as well.\nThe phone rings, and it is Chick Clark, a newspaper editor, whom Eileen met in an elevator, wanting to see Eileen.\n\nThe upstairs neighbors, Wreck, an out-of-season American football player (\"Pass the Football\"), and his live-in lover, Helen, ask the girls to hide Wreck while Helen's mother, Mrs. Ella Wade is in town, because Mrs. Wade does not yet know about Wreck.\nEileen happily agrees to stow him in their apartment, much to Ruth's hesitation.\nWreck describes his lucky history as a student at Trenton Tech, who got by very well only because of his ability with football.\n\nEileen has invited Frank Lippencott, Bob Baker, and Chick Clark, a slimy newspaper scribe whom she has met with the object of furthering Ruth's career, over for potluck supper.\nUnaware of each other's feelings, both women find themselves attracted to Bob.\nSoon, all five of them are seated around the cramped apartment trying to fill the awkward silence (\"Conversation Piece\").\nMeanwhile, Helen deals with her overbearing and exaggerated mother.\n\nRuth and Bob talk over the quality of her stories, and he advises her to write about what she knows rather than flights of fancy.\nBoth say several wrong things, and he finally tells her off.\nHe soon regrets it as Ruth rushes inside in tears  (\"A Quiet Girl\").\n\nWhile all this is happening, anxious to be alone with Eileen, Chick Clark creates a bogus assignment for Ruth.\nHe sends her off to the Brooklyn Navy Yard to interview a group of Brazilian navy cadets.\nShe quickly realizes that their sole interest is to learn and dance the \"Conga!\" . \nThe sailors follow Ruth home, where the girls soon find themselves in chaotic confusion, as all the citizens of Christopher Street join the conga line in a finale.\nRuth runs into Bob and gives him a piece of her mind, while Eileen is hauled off to jail for causing the riot.\n\nIn the local jail Eileen finds herself practically running the place, with Officer Lonigan and his brigade of doting Irish police officers at her beck and call.\nGiven her name, they are convinced that she is Irish.\nThey serenade her and are not at all discouraged when she says she is not Irish (\"My Darlin' Eileen\").\nRuth comes to assure Eileen that she will bail her out as soon as she collects the money from her new job as a promoter for the Village Vortex, a local nightclub.\nAt the club, Ruth digs the rhythm of swing (\"Wonderful Town Swing\").\n\nMeanwhile, Wreck is awkwardly masquerading as a wealthy art collector to meet the approval of Helen's mother, and Chick is frantically calling Eileen, trying to make things right.\n\nThanks to Bob, Eileen is soon released from jail, and the sisters learn that Mr. Appopoulos has been so scandalized by a missing picture that he painted (that was actually stolen and sold for $2 by Helen and Wreck for Wreck to stay at the Y) as well as Eileen's arrest that he has threatened to evict them.\nEileen discovers that Ruth is also attracted to Bob Baker, and the two of them wish, for a moment, that they had never left home (\"Ohio\" (reprise)).\nEileen is then confronted by the rhythmical Speedy Valenti, owner of the Village Vortex (the night club), who arranges for her New York City debut as a singer because her fame has reached the front page of the news.\nMr. Appopoulos immediately changes his tune now that one of his tenants has a paying job, and extends their lease.\n\nEileen soon learns that Bob Baker has quit his job as a result of a disagreement with his boss about Ruth's story on the Brazilian sailors.\nEileen is thrilled that Bob quit his job and assures the unbelieving Bob that it's love that he feels for Ruth.\nBob, faced with the facts, hesitantly realizes the truth that it is love (\"It's Love\").\n\nThe mood at the Vortex turns jazzy (\"Ballet At the Village Vortex\").\nEileen finds herself with a case of stage fright and she convinces Ruth to join her on stage to sing.\nChick arrives to make amends and presents Ruth with a press pass : His boss has read her story about the Brazilian sailors and loved it, and given Ruth a job to take on the following Monday.\nThe Vortex is alive with singing and dancing (\"Wrong Note Rag\"), and Bob decides it is the perfect moment to let Ruth know how he feels.\nThe curtain closes as Eileen and the guests at the club sing \"It's Love\" along with everyone in a finale in celebration of Ruth and Bob's newfound affection.",

The story focuses on fictional US President Stephen Decatur Henderson, who runs into political trouble following a disastrous trip to the Soviet Union , and his problems with his children. Bored with life as a civilian after his presidency ends, he decides to return to political life.\n\nThe original 1962 Broadway production ran for 265 performances and starred Robert Ryan and Nanette Fabray . The show received a generally unenthusiastic response and was Irving Berlin's last musical.",
        "synopsis": "President Stephen Decatur Henderson is a true patriot and loves his family.  His daughter Leslie has recently had a series of romantic liaisons, some liberal and some conservative.  Her newest romance is with Youssein Davair, the son of a Middle Eastern ruler; the sincerity of his affection is questionable.  Pat Gregory, a Secret Service agent, has watched Leslie grow up and has fallen in love with her but doesn't believe that she could be interested in a simple guy like him. With the Cold War as a backdrop, Henderson, together with Nell, his First Lady, and their children go on a \"good-will tour\" of Europe, including the Soviet Union. Henderson gets in trouble for jokingly comparing the Soviet leader to a \"wild cat\". But the President lands in Moscow anyhow and gives a conciliatory and humanizing speech, assisted by his Russian-speaking son Larry, that earns the respect of the Soviets. Nevertheless, back at home, the gaffe plagues him and hurts his party's popularity. Larry is a bit of a hot-head and punches the party chairman on TV to defend his father. The presidential term of office ends, and the Hendersons leave the White House.\n\nIn Act II, Henderson finds his post-politics life in Ohio mundane.  The family is invited to a party at the White House, and there Leslie finds that Youssein is now interested in Betty Chandler, the daughter of the new president, and so they break up. Leslie leaves the party with Pat. Meanwhile, one of Ohio's senators dies, and the governor asks Henderson to finish his term of office. Henderson yearns to return to public life, but he questions the governor's motives and declines the job. Soon afterwards, however, another opportunity comes: the new president asks Henderson to attend an international summit meeting on behalf of the US, because of the respect that he commands in the Soviet Union.",

The musical focuses on the love story between Helen and Paris as it follows his participation in the Trojan War. Paris is about the struggle to maintain some balance between passion and order, law and chaos, head and heart.",
        "synopsis": "Paris gave a gift to the goddess Aphrodite in order to be with her. King Priam of Troy prays for guidance from the goddesses Aphrodite and Athena. Cassandra and Laocoen lament over the poor decision that Priam is about to make. She tries to warn her father (\"Head Without a Heart\"). Priam ignores her and sends Paris to the Greek province of Sparta as an emissary to foster goodwill (\"What Could Go Wrong?\"). Paris and Aeneas sail to Sparta, but the boat is wrecked in a storm and Paris falls overboard. Helen, the wife of King Menalaus of Sparta, finds Paris washed up on shore and nurses him (\"Perfect Stranger\"). He mistakes her for Aphrodite, falling in love at first sight. Helen wishes she could leave her life behind. Paris stumbles upon Sinon, Thersites and Talbythius, who escort him to the palace to meet the Greek kings.\n\nAgamemnon and Menelaus try to convince the other Greek kings to invade Troy, but to no avail. (\"Business\") Achilles barges in on the meeting and asks how Agamemnon thought it would be possible to take Troy without him leading the army. (\"The Leader\") When Paris arrives, the Greek nobles are fighting about business. They make fun of their bedraggled visitor, and Agamemnon thinks up a plan to exploit the Trojan prince for information. (\"Paris in Court\") Helen tries to convince Paris that he has fallen into a trap, but ends up falling in love with him, and they escape together. (\"Any Fool Could See\") They discuss that they can never be together, as they both have duties to their people. However, a guard finds them and tries to kill Paris, but Helen saves his life by stabbing the guard in the back. Helen's old friend, the fisherman, tells them to escape. When Agamemnon appears, he kills both the fisherman and Helen's handmaiden, framing Paris for the crime.\n\nMenelaus reflects on his love for Helen. (\"A Thief In The Night\") He will never rest until he has her back. This convinces the other kings to follow him and attack Troy. Paris sings to Helen about how fate has brought them together (\"Trust in Your Heart\"). Paris and Helen arrive at Troy, facing the judgement of his entire family for provoking the Greek kings and potentially starting a war. Paris stands up to his father, telling him that he will be with Helen, \"Come Hell or High Water\". This sparks a bad reaction in the crowd, who start hurling insults at the two lovers, and not even the rebuttal of Paris' older brother, the heroic Hector, can stop their anger. A war is imminent.\n\nOn the ramparts in Troy, Hector rallies the Trojan army, leading them into battle against the invading Greeks (\"No Turning Back\"). Paris and Helen sing about their love and commitment as a ten-year war begins, and countless soldiers die around them (\"For Better or For Worse\").\n\nAchilles confronts Agamemnon about his selfish attitude and how he claims all the spoils of war for himself. (\"The Greek Camp\"). He throws down his armour, saying that he won't continue to fight for Agamemnon. The Trojans launch an assault on the Greek camp, and with Achilles gone it seems all of their hope is lost. Patroclus dons his friend's armour and leads the Greeks under the guise of their immortal champion. Hector slays Patroclus, and Achilles laments the death of his only friend before challenging Hector to a duel. (\"What Price A Friend\")\n\nAgainst the wishes of his entire family, Hector prepares to face Achilles, believing that he has a chance to end the war once and for all. (\"Love Has Power\") Hector bids farewell to his family and marches out to fight Achilles. Achilles and Hector engage in an epic duel. Hector is the better swordsman, but he cannot penetrate the armour of the immortal warrior, who relies on brute force. Hector kicks Achilles in his one weak point, his heel, and drives him to the ground, where he frantically slashes at his foe, but is still unable to harm him. Desperately, Achilles, strikes up at Hector, impaling him. As Achilles ties the body of his fallen adversary to his chariot, Paris shoots an arrow at him from the walls of Troy, hitting him in the heel and killing him. (\"Two Titans\")\n\nParis mourns his deceased brother as the two leaders are carried off for their funerals. Ulysses, disguised as a beggar, confronts Helen, asking her if she knows any way to end the war. She has no answers for him. (\"The Beggar\") Ulysses prays to Athena, asking her for a way to end the war. He gets a response from the goddess and constructs the legendary Trojan Horse, realising that the only way out is a head without a heart. (\"Ulysses Prayer\") Agamemnon 'volunteers' Sinon as a stooge in order to convince the Trojans to bring the horse inside the city. (\"A Horse With No Rider\") Inside the horse, Sinon drunkenly explains Agamemnon's plan to Thersites and Talbythius. (\"Inside Outside\") The Trojans find the horse and Sinon, who convinces Priam to take it into the city. Cassandra laments that Paris should have known better, as Thersites and Talbythius sneak out of the horse and open the gates of Troy, letting the Greek army in. (\"The Balance Shifts\")\n\nA rout ensues.(\"Oh, Paris\") Paris and Aeneas try to gather up the royal family and escape the city, but find that Priam has already been murdered. They gather a small group of survivors and attempt to escape, but Menelaus finds them and shoots an arrow into Paris' back, still believing him to have abducted Helen against her will. However, as Paris dies in his lover's arms, Menalaus finally realises that Helen truly loved him and attempts to console her amidst the burning wreckage of Troy (\"Finale\").",

The original movie revolved around a daytime soap opera , while the show involves a Broadway musical.",
        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nMichael Dorsey, a struggling actor, is fired after causing a scene during rehearsals in a show directed by Ron Carlisle. Due to his demeanor, he is unable to get any other parts (\"Opening Number\"). While closing up the steakhouse they work at, Michael complains to his roommate, Jeff Slater, that nobody wants to hire him. Since it's Michael's 40th birthday, Jeff decides to read him the bucket list he made when he was 19, reading off everything Michael swore to accomplish in 20 years. Michael, angered by this, thinks about how little he's accomplished (\"Whaddya Do\"). Sandy Lester, Michael's neurotic ex-girlfriend, arrives at their apartment for his birthday and immediately starts bickering about how terrible her life is. Michael, expecting a party, arrives and is surprised by Sandy and Jeff. After thanking them, Sandy gets Michael to help her with her audition for the musical Juliet's Curse . She panics about all the things she knows will happen at her audition (\"What's Gonna Happen\").\n\nMichael goes to his agent, Stan Fields, that afternoon and demands to know why he didn't get called back. They argue and Stan tells him that he is incredibly hard to work and get along with and that he will never work again. Michael storms out, desperate for a job. But while looking through Sandy's script, he gets an idea (\"Whaddya Do Reprise 1\"). At the auditions, women are auditioning for the role of the Nurse but are all getting turned down. When it's finally Sandy's turn she refuses to stop singing the moment she gets turned down but eventually gives up and leaves. Dorothy Michaels, Michael's made up female alter ego, enters and humbles the producer Rita Marshall. She sings the audition song and is hired by Ron and Rita (\"I Won't Let You Down\"). Dorothy meets Jeff at the steakhouse and reveals himself to be Michael, to Jeff's dismay. Jeff tells him that what he is doing is stupid and incredibly harmful to any kind of woman and asks what he will tell Sandy, since he took her role. Michael says they won't tell her and talks about his plans with Dorothy. The next day at rehearsals, Dorothy witnesses the mess of a show that is Juliet's Curse . She meets the dimwit reality star winner of Race to Bachelor Island , Max Van Horn, who was cast as Romeo 's brother named Craig. She also meets the actress starring as Juliet , Julie Nichols. They perform the song of Juliet celebrating her survival, choreographed by Ron Carlisle (\"I'm Alive\").\n\nAfter the show, Julie and Dorothy have lunch together. Julie tells Dorothy about her dreams and about how she chose them over a relationship, and she'd do it again (\"There Was John\"). Dorothy and Julie agree on a way to make the show better. After a few days at rehearsal, Dorothy improvises getting Craig to fall in love with the Nurse instead of Juliet. Ron is infuriated with this, but everyone in the team sides with Dorothy, including Rita. She lets Dorothy lead the show. Everyone is extremely happy with the changes and having Dorothy as their new leader. Rita changes the show's name to Juliet's Nurse (\"I Like What She's Doing\"). After the show, Dorothy and Julie head back to Julie's apartment. While Julie talks about herself and Dorothy listens, Michael is realizing that he is in love with her (\"Who Are You\").\n\nMichael heads back home to tell Jeff about his day with Julie, which is interrupted by Sandy at the door. She asks Michael where he's been and tells him she's been devastated about not getting the part. After a small tangent of how horrible her life is, Michael promises to have dinner with her to make it up to her. She agrees to it, but panics knowing that something will go wrong and Michael will probably stand her up (\"What's Gonna Happen Reprise\"). She leaves. Jeff tells Michael that what Michael's doing is ridiculous, and he won't be able to get away with it without hurting people, which he is already doing. Michael is too blind to understand this; he disagrees and says Dorothy will be successful and around forever (\"Unstoppable\"). Still daydreaming about his success, he runs into Julie as Dorothy who thanks her. Dorothy kisses her on impulse and scares Julie off.\n\n### Act Two\n\nBack at his apartment, Jeff sums up and mocks Michael's recent mishaps (\"Jeff Sums It Up\"). Michael gets a call telling him that the cast is going to see Julie sing at a bar, so he decides to go and meet Julie there himself. Julie sings a song about her feelings towards Dorothy (\"Gone, Gone, Gone\"). After the song, Michael catches Ron's attention and discovers that he's taking all the credit for Dorothy. Even more motivated to talk to Julie now, he goes up to her and tries to flirt, which results in her throwing wine in his face. They go back home and Jeff makes fun of him, when they're interrupted again by Sandy. She yells at Michael for standing her up, but before leaving, she informs them about Dorothy getting the role and how annoying she is. Michael tells her that she shouldn't be envious of another woman's success; Sandy says no and leaves.\n\nMichael decides he will go over to Julie's as Dorothy and have Dorothy be honest with her. At Julie's apartment, Ron is trying to get Julie to date him while Julie rejects him every time. Dorothy comes, and Julie lets her in. Ron blames Julie disliking him on Dorothy, to which she defends herself and Julie. After getting Ron to leave, Julie tells Dorothy that she thinks she has feelings for Dorothy and wants to pursue them. Dorothy quickly rejects her, upsetting Julie, who thought they had started something special (\"Who Are You Reprise\"). Michael heads back home. While undressing himself, he hears Max singing for Dorothy outside. After he is yelled at by a neighbor twice, he decides to let him in. He goes and proclaims his love to Dorothy through a ballad and an infected tattoo of her face on his chest (\"This Thing\"). Right after he finishes, Jeff walks in on them and calls Dorothy a trollop. Max attempts to fight him but is told to leave by Dorothy.\n\nAfter getting him to leave, Michael finally sheds himself of Dorothy and tells Jeff about his day. After proclaiming that this couldn't get any worse, Stan comes in. He tells Michael that he has booked a role in a play. Michael tells him he is unable to take it because he's doing Jeff's play. Stan tells him that it's the worst decision he's ever made in his life and leaves. Michael decides he wants to try and fix things with Julie again (\"Whaddya Do Reprise\"). But while half dressed as Dorothy, Stan comes back and walks in on them. At first he greets Dorothy as if nothing was wrong, then returns in agony. Stan tells him he'll be scorned nationwide and he fires him again. It's the next day and the cast and crew are celebrating opening night (\"The Most Important Night\"). Before the show in Dorothy's dressing room, Rita congratulates and thanks Dorothy for her impact on the show, extending her contract another year as an opening night gift. Dorothy tells her to pay Julie the same as Max and she will take it. After Rita leaves, Max enters. Max thanks Dorothy for believing in him when he had always felt different from everyone else. Max then declares that he will thrust into her opening. Dorothy tells him that he doesn't need her help and to trust in himself. After Max leaves, Julie walks in to leave a note and tells Dorothy that she has never been anything but honest to her. Julie then and tells Dorothy that she means a lot to her and loves her, but they probably shouldn't see each other anymore. Michael self reflects, begging his alter ego to show him what to do next (\"Talk To Me Dorothy\").\n\nDorothy and the cast are now performing the finale for Juliet's Nurse (\"Arrivederci!\"). Dorothy interrupts the song as Nurse, and begins improvising, with Max joining her as Craig halfway. Julie, out of character, stops her and asks what she's doing. Dorothy has no choice but to reveal herself as Michael Dorsey, a desperate actor who just wanted to work. Everyone on stage, including Rita and Ron, are shocked. Julie, hurt, is at a loss of words and runs off. Max, also hurt, asks Michael if Jeff knows. The reveal sparks debate over Michael's charade being exploitation or advocation.\n\nSandy returns to their apartment in a frenzy. She and Jeff fight over Michael's influence on her and Jeff's writing stagnation until Jeff hits on her, and they realize they are attracted to each other. Just as they are about to kiss, Sandy panics about how what they're doing is a bad idea but is cut off by Jeff kissing her (\"What's Gonna Happen Reprise 2\"). They run off into the bedroom. Michael comes home the morning after, and in between his regret, realizes how creating Dorothy widened his empathy towards the women in his life. He apologizes to an emerging Sandy for obstructing her chances with the show. Sandy admits that idealizing Michael was hindering her self-confidence and potential future alongside Jeff, who hands Michael a play penned from the experience. Michael wonders if Julie will ever speak to him again (\"Michael's Reprise\"). Later, Michael meets Julie at the park, awkwardly apologizing. Julie at first retorts his damage was to everyone in the production as well as her, and when she relays the vast disappointment and bias that women experience, Michael vows to listen to anything she needs conveying. She gently concedes that Michael truly staked his pride to perform, but she misses Dorothy. Michael offers a better, forthcoming connection from what they shared before, however closely; Julie allows it. They silently move back to a bench to determine this, between their chastening and hope (\"Thank You\").",

They are \"identical\" twenty-year-old twins, Viola and Sebastian. Even in this life-threatening situation, they are bickering as usual (No One's Perfect Dear).  In the confusion of the ship sinking, the twins are parted. Viola lands in Illyria where, being told Sebastian drowned, she expresses her loneliness in the strange city (The Flowers). A mysterious stranger gives her a business-card with a job offer. The all-male rock quartet \"The Apocalypse\" is short one member since Disease was drafted to fight in Vietnam. Famine, War and Death all hate the idea of being forced into such a role (I'm Not Afraid/I'm Me). Disguised as a guy, Charlie, Viola auditions to become \"The Apocalypse\u2019s\u201d fourth member (Somethin's Happenin (Baby! Baby!)). She is successful and joins the group, thanks to winning over their 30-year-old manager, Orson.\n\nMeanwhile, recovering in hospital from his shipwreck ordeal, Sebastian grieves his sister's death in the shipwreck (Come Away, Death).  Realising he'll have to move forward on his own, he goes in search of a job and a mysterious stranger gives him a business-card with a job offer. He meets up with Orson, who mistakes Sebastian for his twin, Viola/Charlie and confirms his appointment as the new member of \"The Apocalypse\".  Sebastian is too thrilled at getting a job to worry his new manager can't get his name right (I'm On My Way To the Top).\n\nOrson is in love with Olivia, the 30-year-old owner of the nightclub where \u201cThe Apocalypse\u201d is the star act.  She doesn't want to see him so he asks \"Charlie\" to deliver a love letter to Olivia. Viola realises that she also is falling in love with Orson (She Never Told Her Love). Inspired by her own situation, Viola advises Orson on how he should win Olivia (Be Gentle). Unfortunately, Olivia falls for Orson's messenger(s), not realising the second \u201cCharlie\u201d, who likes her, isn't the first, who didn't.\n\nWhile the mixed-up couples continue their ever-changing yet confusing relationships, \"The Apocalypse\" set about rehearsals with their newest member (The Apocalypse Fugue), Viola's confusion continues (What Do I Know) and friendships grow (The Now Generation). As the confusion builds, the younger Sebastian acknowledges his growing love for the more mature Olivia (The Middle Years). Separately, Olivia also realises that she is falling in love with the younger messenger (The Middle Years (Reprise)). Meanwhile, Orson realises that he has identified unexplainable feelings for \"Charlie\" (Young and In Love). The confusion builds (Hunca Munca) resulting in an argument between Sebastian and Olivia, which they eventually settle (Don't Leave Me). Finally, the mix-ups are resolved. The twins are reunited. Viola gets Orson and Sebastian gets Olivia (Your Own Thing).",

        "description": "Forbidden Zone is an American absurdist musical fantasy comedy film produced and directed by independent filmmaker Richard Elfman , and co-written by Elfman and Matthew Bright . Shot in 1977 and 1978, the film premiered in 1980 and was distributed in 1982. Originally shot on black-and-white film , Forbidden Zone is based upon the stage performances of the Los Angeles theater troupe The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo , of which Elfman, Bright and many of the cast and crew were a part, and revolves around an alternate universe accessed through a door in the house of the Hercules family.\n\nThe composing debut of Danny Elfman , it stars Herv\u00e9 Villechaize , Susan Tyrrell and members of the Mystic Knights, with appearances by Warhol superstar Viva , Joe Spinell and The Kipper Kids . Villechaize kicked his cheque back into production and even painted sets on weekends. The only paid actor was Phil Gordon, who played Flash; all the other SAG actors put their money back into the show.\n\nThe film was made as an attempt to capture the essence of The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo's live performances in a cinematic sense, and also as a means for both director Elfman to retire from music to work on film projects, and to serve as a transition between the group's former cabaret style and a new wave -based style. Amid negative reactions to content in the film that had been perceived as being offensive, Forbidden Zone was screened as a midnight movie , where it was met with positive notices, and developed a large and eventually worldwide cult following . In 2004, the film was digitally restored and released on DVD , and in 2008, the film was colorized .\n\nSaid Elfman, \"Doing anything original is taking a chance. Financially it bankrupted me and we lost our house. But I'm still glad I did it (although I'd change a few things if I had a time machine, of course).\"\n\nA prospective sequel, entitled Forbidden Zone 2: The Forbidden Galaxy , has long been in development by Elfman, who launched a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2014 to raise an initial sum. As of 2019, the sequel is still in the stages of development but regularly updated and discussed by Elfman. Elfman has also licensed Forbidden Zone as an intellectual property for manufacturers to produce collectibles based on the film's characters.",
        "synopsis": "On \"Friday, April 17\" at 4 p.m. in Venice, California , Huckleberry P. Jones (pimp, narcotics peddler, and slumlord) enters a vacant house that he owns. While stashing heroin in the basement, he stumbles upon a mysterious door and enters it, falling into the Sixth Dimension, from which he promptly escapes. After retrieving the heroin, he sells the house to the Hercules family. On their way to school, Frenchy Hercules and her brother Flash talk with Squeezit Henderson, who says that, while being beaten by his mother, he has a vision of his transgender sister Ren\u00e9, who had fallen into the Sixth Dimension through the door in the Hercules' basement.\n\nFrenchy returns home to confide in her mother, and decides to take a \"little peek\" behind the basement's forbidden door. There, she is captured by the perpetually topless Princess, who brings Frenchy to the rulers of the Sixth Dimension, the midget King Fausto and his queen, Doris. When the king falls for Frenchy, Doris orders their frog servant, Bust Rod, to lock her up. To make sure that Frenchy is not harmed, Fausto tells Bust Rod to take Frenchy to Cell 63, where the king keeps his favorite concubines (as well as Ren\u00e9).\n\nThe next day at school, Flash tries to convince Squeezit to help him rescue Ren\u00e9 and Frenchy. When Squeezit refuses, Flash enlists the help of Gramps instead. In the Sixth Dimension, they speak to an old Jewish man who reveals how to help Frenchy escape, but they soon are captured by Bust Rod. Doris interrogates Flash and Gramps before lowering them into a septic tank. She then plots her revenge against Frenchy, relocating all the denizens of Cell 63 to a torture chamber. She leaves the Princess to oversee Frenchy's torture and execution. However, when a fuse is blown, the torture is put on hold and the prisoners from Cell 63 are relocated to keep the King from finding them.\n\nAfter escaping the tank, Flash and Gramps come across a woman who says that she was once happily married to the king, until Doris stole the throne by seducing her. The ex-queen has been sitting in her cell for 1,000 years, and has been writing a screenplay to keep her sanity. Meanwhile, Pa Hercules is blasted through the stratosphere by an explosion caused by improperly extinguishing his cigarette in a vat of flammable tar during his work break at the La Brea Tar Pit Factory. After re-entry, Pa falls through the basement and into the Sixth Dimension, where he is imprisoned.\n\nFinding a phone, Flash calls Squeezit and again asks for his help. Squeezit agrees to help rescue Frenchy and Ren\u00e9. In the Sixth Dimension, he is captured by Satan , with whom he makes a deal to bring him the Princess in exchange for Satan's help freeing Ren\u00e9 and Frenchy. Squeezit accomplishes this task, but failed to include himself in the deal to rescue his friends, and the devil has him decapitated. Queen Doris sends Bust Rod to keep an eye on the king, and to ensure he does not find out where she has hidden Frenchy.\n\nFausto catches Bust Rod and forces him to lead him to Frenchy and Ren\u00e9, whom he orders to leave the Sixth Dimension to avoid the Queen's wrath. However, en route to safety, Ren\u00e9 is stricken with pseudo-menstrual cramps, and they are again captured by the frog. Squeezit's head, which has now sprouted chicken wings, finds the king and reveals what has happened.\n\nWhile preparing to kill Frenchy, Doris is confronted by the ex-queen, and the two engage in a cat-fight; Doris eventually coming out as the victor. Just as she is about to kill Frenchy, Fausto stops her, explaining that Satan's Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo are holding the Princess hostage, and will kill her should anything befall Frenchy. Flash and Gramps arrive, and Flash is knocked down by Gramps. Ma Hercules enters and, seeing a seemingly dead Flash, shoots Doris. Fausto mourns Doris, then marries Frenchy.\n\nThe surviving characters later plan to take over everyone and everything in the Galaxy.",

        "synopsis": "A thirty-something Dublin busker (identified only as \"Guy\") sings a heartfelt ballad of unrequited love on a Dublin street, accompanying himself on guitar (\"Leave\"). He then puts his guitar in its case and turns to leave without it but a young Czech woman (identified only as \"Girl\"), who has been listening to him sing approaches. She asks numerous personal questions about his songs and he replies that he wrote most of them for a girlfriend who broke up with him and moved to New York City.  He is giving up on his music because the memories of his failed relationship are too painful so he now works as a vacuum cleaner repairman in his father's shop. Girl responds that she has a vacuum that \"does not suck\" and asks him to fix it. She offers to pay for the repair by playing piano for him. Over his protests, she snatches the sheet music for a new song from his jacket.  Reluctantly, Guy picks up his guitar and they play the song together (\"Falling Slowly\"). Girl suggests that he could win his old girlfriend back by singing her that song. Guy brushes this off but Girl reminds him that he now owes her a vacuum repair so they head to his father's shop (\"The North Strand\").\nAs Guy fixes the vacuum, Girl becomes acquainted with his father, who seems to like her. Once the vacuum is repaired, Guy impulsively invites Girl to his bedroom, above the shop.  They are clearly attracted to each other but when he attempts to kiss her she stops him and leaves (\"The Moon\"). The next day he apologises and they write, rehearse and record songs together. Girl introduces Guy to her family, including her young daughter, Ivanka (\"Ej, Pada, Pada, Rosicka\"). After Guy leaves, Girl plays one of his songs on the piano, substituting her own lyrics as she thinks of him (\"If You Want Me\").\nThe next morning Girl tells Guy that she has arranged a meeting with a banker (\"Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy\"). To persuade the bank manager to approve a loan \u2013 which would enable Guy to take his music to New York \u2013 Guy plays him a song (\"Say It to Me Now\"). The banker is impressed with his talent, approves the loan and adds that he can play guitar as well. He plays a song for them (\"Abandoned in Bandon\") and though he is not a very good singer, they invite him to play in the band. The following night at a nightclub, Guy tells Girl that she has convinced him that his musical career is worth pursuing. Good, she replies, because its open mic night at the club and she has signed him up to perform as \"The Hoover Man\". He is reluctant but eventually takes the stage. As he sings, it seems like he is now singing to Girl, not his ex-girlfriend (\"Gold\").\n\nDuring band practice, one of the musicians gets into an argument with the bank manager. He opposes capitalism, he says, despite the fact that he owns the shop where they are rehearsing. Guy and Girl retreat to a hill overlooking the city where the two share a brief, tender moment.  Girl tells Guy, in Czech, that she loves him \u2013 but when he asks her to translate, she replies, \"It looks like rain\". Guy realizes that he has fallen in love with Girl and wonders how he will live without her when he moves to New York (\"Sleeping\").\nThe next day the band records a demo for a major record label (\"When Your Mind's Made Up\"). After receiving praise for their performance, the band members take a break. Girl remains at the piano, and thinking she is alone, plays one of her own compositions that reveals the depth of her feelings for Guy (\"The Hill\").  Guy, who has been listening, compliments her on her song. He suggests that she and Ivanka move to New York with him because they clearly have feelings for each other that they cannot ignore. Girl answers angrily that he cannot feel that way.  Incredulous, Guy asks why and Girl replies that her husband \u2013 Ivanka's father \u2013 is trying to reconcile with her and for the sake of their daughter she must consider it (\"It Cannot Be About That\"). The following morning the band gathers at the hill to voice their hopes for success with the impending album (\"Gold (A Cappella)\"). Guy asks Girl to spend his last night in Dublin with him but she demurs, because it would only result in \" hanky-panky \", which is a \"bad idea\"; but ultimately she agrees to come to the vacuum shop.\nBack at the shop, Guy plays the demo for his father.  Impressed and moved, he gives Guy money to help him get settled in New York. Then Guy, encouraged by Girl, calls his ex-girlfriend in New York, who is happy about his imminent arrival, and seems willing to give their relationship another try.  A few days later Girl comes home to find a piano with a bright red bow on it \u2013 a gift from Guy.  She sheds a few tears, then sits at the piano and sings; as Guy, in his New York apartment, sings the same song (\"Falling Slowly (Reprise)\").",

The rest of the contestants and contest runners join the stage and all sing about the truck and the contest (\"Human Drama Kind of Thing\"). The song ends as the contest begins. As the contestants begin to bond they talk about what a truck means to a Texan and why the contestants want the truck and what difference it would make in their life (\"If I Had This Truck\"). The news crew covering the competition start interviewing the contestants and Janis Curtis and her husband Don catch their attention. Even though he isn't participating in the contest, he is forcing himself to go through everything that his wife has to go through because they're in it together. (\"If She Don't Sleep\").\n\nIt's a ways into the competition now and no one has fallen yet. Benny has been teasing many of the contestants, trying to intimidate them, as he is the only one of them who has won the contest in the past or even participated. He begins belittling Ronald McCowan, who has been snacking on candy bars the whole time. Thusly, he isn't doing so well. He illustrates such with his song \"My Problem Right There\" while the girls, Kelli, Heather, and Norma are rooting for him because they don't like Benny. The song ends with him taking his hands off and giving up. Benny says that once the first person drops, more people will soon follow.\n\nBenny and the older man in the competition, J.D. Drew have taken to an unlikely partnership. J.D.'s wife, Virginia, keeps visiting and checking up on him, taking care of him during their 15-minute breaks. J.D., however, doesn't like being coddled and pushes her away, saddening her, and she sings about how they used to be when they were young (\"Alone With Me\"). Then it is revealed that Heather, the Southern beauty in the competition, was chosen by Mike Ferris, one of the people running the competition to win, because she would look good in the advertisements and bring Floyd King Nissan more revenue. He's promised to do what he can to make the competition easier. As he brings lets her sit in the air conditioning they sing (\"Burn That Bridge\").\n\nMeanwhile, Kelli Mangrum and Greg Wilhote have been bonding. They decide that if either of them wins they will go together to LA (\"I'm Gone\"). Norma, who's been using her walkman and her faith in God to get her by, begins to crack and breaks into uncontrollable laughter. This bothers Janis immensely and Benny says that it's essentially the beginning of the end. The laughter transitions into a joyful gospel hymn (\"Joy of the Lord\") that everyone joins in singing, save for Chris Alvaro, the stoic veteran who's been unmoving and unspeaking for the whole competition until he cuts off the song, yelling for everyone to shut up. Everyone's unhappy with Chris's cynical nature and foul language, none more so than Benny, whose son also served. The two exchange nasty words before Chris sings about what it was really like to serve overseas (\"Stronger\"). By the end he's crying and runs offstage, the second to lose the contest. Benny's lack of respect for Chris and overall nasty attitude infuriates the other contestants. Fueled by their anger, Benny claims that if they can't \"Hunt with the Big Dogs\" they should stay on the porch with the pups.\n\n### Act Two\n\nAct II begins almost like a commercial with Mike Ferris and Frank Nugent, another host, singing the title song, \"Hands on a Hardbody\". Cindy Barnes, the female host, approaches Jesus Pena, a Mexican contestant and says to him that if he wins she's going to have to see his green card. She repeats what she can in extremely broken Spanish, though he has told her repeatedly that he speaks English and was born in Texas (\"Born in Laredo\"). Later, J.D. reflects on his and Virginia's marriage (\"Alone With Me (Reprise)\").\n\nJanis suddenly pipes up and claims that Heather has taken her hands off the truck to put some lipstick on. Mike does his best to defend Heather but Janis becomes enraged claiming that the competition is fixed (\"It's a Fix\") and leaves the contest in a blaze of fury, becoming the third contestant eliminated. As J.D. and Benny bond further, they begin talking about where they live and J.D., Benny, and Norma become wistful about how the town has been taken over by industry and has none of the personality that it had when they were young (\"Used to Be\").\n\nContestants begin dropping like flies as Jesus, Kelli, and Greg all fall quickly. Jesus hallucinates he's playing with his dog and takes his hands off as if to throw a ball. Kelli is in a daze and walks right off the stage. Greg is hesitant to follow her and give up the competition, but decides it's more important that she doesn't hurt herself and runs after her. Heather is completely jacked up on the uppers she has been taking and begins complaining about how uncomfortable the gloves they have to wear for the contest are. They begin driving her crazy and she confesses that she was set up to win the competition and forfeits (\"It's a Fix (Reprise)\"). Benny confesses to J.D. that his legs are going numb, which he said at the beginning is when it's all over. J.D. encourages him to hold on, but Benny loses faith quickly and recounts what life has done to him when he hoped and prayed (\"God Answered My Prayers\") and reveals that his son killed himself while he was overseas. He lets go, saying that God finally answered his prayers with a \"yes.\"\n\nRonald comes back to see how the competition is going, and to support Norma. Norma loses her faith when her Walkman runs out of juice, so Ronald as well as Chris, who never went back home after losing, begin to sing (\"Joy of the Lord (Reprise)\") to bring back her spirit, but it works too well, as she takes her hands off to clap along to the music. That leaves J.D. as the last man standing and he wins the competition, giving the truck he won to his wife, Virginia. In the end, all the characters recount what happens for them after the competition and how the competition changed their lives (\"Keep Your Hands on It\").",

It is a two-person show about the relationships first between a brother and sister, John and Jen, and then, after John is killed, between Jen and her son, also named John. The musical opened Off-Broadway in 1995 and was revived Off-Broadway in 2015.",
        "synopsis": "Six-year-old Jen Tracy welcomes her newborn brother John into the world, with a warning about the way things work and a promise to protect him from Dad. (\"Welcome to the World\") As they grow, Jen does her best to shield John from life's disappointments, including a painful Christmas Eve fight between their parents. Not long after John's seventh birthday, Jen discovers a bruise on his face. \"It was my fault,\" he tells her, \"I broke a glass.\" Jen vows that Dad will never hurt John again, and she and John make a deal to always be there for each other. (\"Think Big\")\nAs the pair grows older, sibling rivalry crops up when John is forced to attend Jen's high school basketball finals. (\"Dear God\") But when it's time for Jen to go off to college, John begs her not to leave him alone. (\"Hold Down the Fort\") Jen is determined to break free, however, deal or no deal. \"I can't hold your hand forever,\" she tells John. \"Grow up\".\n\nJen embraces the world of the '60s in groovy New York City, where she blossoms into a drug-experimenting hippie while John's life goes in the opposite direction. (\"Timeline\") Without Jen there to protect him, John falls under his father's influence and decides to join the Navy. (\"It Took Me A While\")\n\nWhen Jen returns home from New York, she and John see how much they've changed and how far apart they've grown. (\"Out of My Sight\") Learning of Jen's plans to move to Canada with her draft-dodging boyfriend, John accuses her of rejecting everything he and Dad stand for, and they part in anger. (\"Run and Hide\") After John leaves, Jen unfurls an American flag, drapes it over a coffin, and we learn that John has been killed in Vietnam. \"I'm sorry, little brother,\" she whispers as Act I ends. (\"Epilogue\")\n\nNow living in Canada, 26-year-old Jen is the mother of a newborn baby boy, whom she names John. (\"Old Clothes\") But this John is not the na\u00efve child of the '50s his mother expects him to be. When Jen moves back to the United States, leaving her failed marriage behind, she prepares to spend Christmas alone with seven-year-old John. Her gift to her son is an old baseball glove, which she proudly tells him belonged to his uncle. But John rejects the gift, complaining, \"I'll be the only kid in school with a crappy old glove!\"\n\nJen gets her son to play his uncle's favourite sport, but her obnoxious behavior at games only succeeds in mortifying him. (\"Little League\") Visiting her brother's grave on what would have been his 32nd birthday, Jen remarks on the similarities between the two Johns and vows that she won't fail her son. (\"Just Like You\") But when it's time for the 12-year-old to go off to camp, Jen finds herself barely able to say goodbye. (\"Bye Room\")\n\nIn a montage spanning John's high school years, John and Jen take turns as mock talk show hosts covering topics that reveal Jen's growing dependence on her son and John's struggle for freedom. (\"Talk Show\") Later, when John discovers that his mother has hidden his acceptance packet from Columbia University, it becomes clear that Jen is terrified that she'll lose John \"again,\" and she is no longer able to differentiate between her brother and her son. (\"Smile of Your Dreams\")\n\nFinally realizing how desperately his mother needs him, John decides to forgo Columbia in favour of a local community college. Disturbed to see him throwing away his future on her account, Jen ridicules his decision. John is deeply hurt by his mother's reaction, and he bitterly mocks her influence on his life. (\"Graduation\") As their argument escalates, Jen slaps her son.\n\nShaken by the parallels to her abusive father, Jen retreats to her brother's grave, where she finally accepts that it's time to move on. (\"The Road Ends Here\") John joins his mother at the cemetery, where Jen asks his forgiveness. (\"That Was My Way\") Jen is finally able to let her son go, and they take their first steps into the world on their own. (\"Every Goodbye is Hello\")",

The title is a play on words, referring to the popular Panama hat .\n\nThe musical was adapted as the 1942 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer musical film Panama Hattie , and again in 1954 as an episode of the CBS TV series The Best of Broadway .",
        "synopsis": "Hattie Maloney owns a night club in the Panama Canal Zone where she also performs.  Three sailors from the S.S. Idaho , Skat Briggs, Windy Deegan and Woozy Hoga, ask her to sing at a party they are organizing (\"Join It Right Away\").  Nick Bullet, Hattie's fianc\u00e9, is a wealthy Navy officer.  They are about to meet his eight-year-old daughter Geraldine (Jerry), off the boat from Philadelphia.  He tells Hattie, \"My Mother Would Love You\".  Hattie, eager to make a good impression on her prospective stepdaughter, spends three weeks' wages on her elaborately frilly outfit.  But when she arrives, Jerry makes fun of Hattie's clothing and way of speaking.  Feeling that her marriage is off, Hattie gets drunk on rum (\"I\u2019ve still Got my Health\").  Kitty-Belle, the daughter of Admiral Whitney Randolph, wants to marry Nick, and she schemes to end his romance with Hattie.\n\nFlorrie, a singer in the night club, develops a crush on Nick's very proper butler Vivian Budd (\"Fresh as a Daisy\").  Nick's efforts to persuade Jerry and Hattie to get along with each other finally succeed, with Jerry making the still hungover Hattie cut the bows off her dress and shoes (\"Let\u2019s Be Buddies\").  Jerry gives Hattie advice on how to behave like a lady at a party where she is to be presented to Nick's boss, the Admiral (\"I\u2019m Throwing a Ball Tonight\").  Admiral Randolph is to be presented with a cup, and his daughter Leila suggests that Hattie might present it filled with goldenrod . This gives Whitney hay fever; Hattie is blamed, and Nick is ordered not to marry Hattie.\n\nThe sailors from the S. S. Idaho uncover a spy plot involving saboteurs.  Hattie swears off rum (\"Make It Another Old Fashioned Please\").  Hattie has it out with Leila, whose boyfriend keeps being called in whenever Hattie is on the verge of hitting her.  Meanwhile, Florrie continues to try to attract the romantic attention of Budd (\"All I\u2019ve Got to Get Now is My Man\").  Hattie, two of the sailors and Budd meet regarding these various threads (\"You Said It\").   Mildred Hunter, Leila's best friend, turns out to be a terrorist.  She gives Jerry a secret package to put in Nick's desk.  Hattie overhears the plot to blow up the Panama Canal control room, finds the bomb and throws it out, saving the day.  The grateful Admiral Whitney retracts his order and the sailors praise Hattie (\"God Bless the Woman\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe half-Elven maiden Arwen sings the prologue, urging those to whom she sings to trust their instincts (\"Prologue\" ('Lasto i lamath')). In the region of Middle-earth known as the Shire, Bilbo Baggins, an eccentric and wealthy Hobbit, celebrates his eleventyfirst birthday by vanishing from his birthday party, leaving his greatest treasure, a mysterious magic Ring, to his young relative Frodo Baggins (\"Springle Ring\"). The Ring is greatly desired by the Dark Lord Sauron, who could use it to conquer the world, and must be destroyed in the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. Frodo and his friends Samwise Gamgee, Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took set out along the road that leads out of the Shire, where they meet a group of Elves led by Elr\u00e1nien, an original female character who fills the role of Gildor Inglorion from the source material (\"The Road Goes On\"). Meanwhile, the corrupt wizard Saruman also desires the Ring (\"Saruman\").\n\nAt the Inn of the Prancing Pony in the village of Bree, Frodo and his friends sing and dance for their fellow guests (\"The Cat and the Moon\"). With the assistance of the Ranger Strider, the four Hobbits escape pursuit by the Black Riders, servants of Sauron, and safely reach the Ford of Bruinen (\"Flight to the Ford\"). Awaiting them at the Elven settlement of Rivendell is Arwen, the beloved of Strider, whose true name is Aragorn, heir to the throne of Gondor (\"The Song of Hope\"). Arwen's father, Lord Elrond, calls a Council of Elves, Men and Dwarves at which it is decided that Frodo will carry the Ring to Mordor. The Fellowship of the Ring sets out from Rivendell: Frodo and his three fellow Hobbits, Aragorn, the warrior Boromir, the Elf Legolas, the Dwarf Gimli, and the wizard Gandalf. Arwen and the people of Rivendell invoke the power of the star E\u00e4rendil to protect and guide the Fellowship on its journey (\"Star of E\u00e4rendil\"). In the ancient, ruined Dwarf-mines of Moria, Gandalf confronts a Balrog, a monstrous creature of evil, and falls into the darkness.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe Fellowship takes refuge in Lothl\u00f3rien, the mystical realm of Galadriel, an Elven lady of great power and wisdom (\"The Golden Wood\", \"Lothl\u00f3rien\"). As their journey south continues, Boromir attempts to take the Ring from Frodo; Frodo and Sam flee from the rest of the Fellowship, and Boromir falls in battle. Gandalf returns in time to intervene at the Siege of the City of Kings, where the Lands of Men are under attack by the forces of Saruman and the Orcs of Mordor (\"The Siege of the City of Kings\"). Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are joined on their journey by Gollum, a wretched creature who possessed the Ring for centuries and desires to have it for his own again. As they approach Mordor, Frodo and Sam sing to each other about the power of stories (\"Now and for Always\"). Gollum is moved by their song, but the evil side of his personality asserts itself and he plans to betray the Hobbits (\"Gollum/Sm\u00e9agol\").\n\n### Act III\n\nIf Aragorn can defeat the forces of evil and reclaim the kingship of Men, he will receive Arwen's hand in marriage (\"The Song of Hope (Duet)\"). Meanwhile, Gollum leads Sam and Frodo to the lair of an enormous spider named Shelob so he can take the Ring from Frodo when he is dead, but the hobbits manage to survive and make their way to Mount Doom. Galadriel casts spells to protect the forces of good in the final battle (\"Wonder\", \"The Final Battle\"). Frodo and Sam finally reach the Cracks of Doom to destroy the Ring once and for all, but Frodo is consumed by the Ring's power and claims it for himself. Suddenly, Gollum reappears and takes the Ring from Frodo, but he loses his balance and falls into the fire with it. With the Ring's destruction, Sauron is defeated and the dominion of Men begins. Aragorn becomes King and marries Arwen (\"City of Kings\"), but Frodo, wearied by his quest, decides to leave Middle-earth forever and sail with Bilbo, Gandalf and the Great Elves to the lands of the West (\"Epilogue (Farewells)\"). After bidding farewell to their friend, Sam, Merry and Pippin return to the Shire (\"Finale\").",

As the citizens of Tromaville cry for help (\"Who Will Save New Jersey?\") Melvin Ferd the Third, an aspiring earth scientist , vows to clean up the state. Everyone is skeptical.\n\nAt the Tromaville Library, Melvin visits Sarah, the town's beautiful, blind librarian. Barely able to contain his unrequited love, Melvin informs her that horrible vats of toxic goo have appeared all over Tromaville and he is determined to find out who's responsible and put a stop to them. Sarah, turned on by his environmental heroism, asks to feel his face. He reluctantly allows her and Sarah quickly realizes that she is not attracted to him one bit.

At Tromaville City Hall, Mayor Babs Belgoody expresses her unbridled ambition to become New Jersey's governor (\"Jersey Girl\"). But Melvin enters with evidence that will defer her dream - he has discovered that the kick-back happy Mayor is the person who is allowing Tromaville to be overrun by toxic waste.

When Melvin leaves, she immediately orders her two goons, Sluggo and Bozo, to \"Get the Geek\".\n\nThe goons toss Melvin into a drum of toxic waste, leaving him for dead. In an incredible coincidence, Sarah happens to walk by on her way home. Never ones to pass up the opportunity to sexually harass someone, the goons taunt Sarah, who immediately faints. As she does, a large, terrifying roar shakes the air. And up from the smoking green slime emerges the Toxic Avenger, a large, green mutant with a hideously deformed face and a ripped, superhero body. The Toxic Avenger sees the unconscious Sarah and informs the goons that they're in deep trouble (\"Kick Your Ass\"). He then proceeds to rip them to shreds. The Toxic Avenger scoops Sarah up and carries her off to her pattern-challenged apartment. When she awakens, the mutant confesses that he's toxic. She assumes that that's a French name and she decided to nickname him Toxie. He is delighted until she asks to touch his face. He refuses, stating that he has horrible acne. Sarah then invites him back for brunch tomorrow, and after he leaves she phones her two best friends to brag about her smokin' hunk of a hero (\"My Big French Boyfriend\").\n\nIn the streets of Tromaville, Toxie pines for his love (\"Thank God She's Blind\"). When Toxie arrives home, Ma Ferd comes upon her transformed son and expresses her lifelong disappointment in him. Desperate for help, he goes to their primary care HMO physician (\"Big Green Freak\"), who sends him to Tromaville's leading ethical mad-scientist, Professor Ken, who reveals that the only thing that can kill Toxie is household bleach. Back in her apartment, Sarah is dictating a fantastic idea for a best- selling memoir (\"Choose Me, Oprah!\"). Toxie visits but tells her he can't stay long because he's on a mission to single-handedly remove every vile vat of toxic waste from Tromaville. As Sarah tries to seduce Toxie, he confesses that he's never actually been on a date with a girl. Turned on by his virginity, Sarah joins Toxie in expressing their newfound feelings (\"Hot Toxic Love\").\n\nDown at the Tromaville docks, the Mayor supervises the unloading of a huge shipment of toxic waste. But Toxie foils her plan, and he reveals that he's actually Melvin Ferd the Third. Not one to let a superhero mutant freak get the better of her, the Mayor vows to destroy him. But to her dismay, Toxie quickly becomes a folk hero to the people of Tromaville (\"The Legend of the Toxic Avenger\"). The Mayor barges into Professor Ken's lab, insisting he tell her how to kill the mutant. Professor Ken refuses, but the Mayor overwhelms him with her incredible sex appeal (\"Evil is Hot\"). At Tromaville Beauty Salon, Melvin's beleaguered mother is informed by her two hairdressers - Lorenzo and Lamas - that her childhood enemy, none other than the Mayor, is coming to see her. Determined to find the whereabouts of Melvin, the Mayor corners Ma and the two women brawl (\"Bitch/Slut/Liar/Whore\"). Back at her apartment, Sarah grows increasingly frustrated with her fruitless attempts to seduce Toxie. But with the Mayor closing in, Toxie tells Sarah he must leave Tromaville. Before he goes, he reveals his true identity. Sarah is flabbergasted but vows to love him anyway - that is until she touches his face, at which point she tearfully suggests that they both start seeing other handicapped people. Hurt and angry, Toxie takes to the street (\"Everybody Dies!\") and brutally kills an adorable senior citizen, Edna Ferbert. But the heartbroken Toxie cannot sustain the beast within (\"You Tore My Heart Out\"). At the library, Ma Ferd finds Sarah crying, but Ma convinces the sobbing librarian that her mutant son isn't that much different from other men. In an inspiring and beautiful moment of human understanding, they reflect of how \"All Men Are Freaks\".\n\nOn the steps of City Hall, the Mayor rallies both citizens of Tromaville to form a drunken, frenzied lynch mob. The chase ensues, encompassing everyone in Tromaville, until Toxie is cornered. But just as the Mayor is about to extinguish him with bleach, Sarah rushes in and fires several gunshots, every one of them missing the Mayor. Fortunately, one shot eventually hits the Mayor, but not before Toxie has been hit with bleach. Toxie crumples and dies in Sarah's arms. As the librarian weeps, Ma Ferd rushes in with the one thing that can save him- the most vile, disgusting liquid on Earth- a glass of water from the Hudson River . As Tromaville reacts with unmitigated joy, Toxie comes to and vows to kill all polluters and end global warming . And one year later on election night, Ma Ferd introduces the new first family of New Jersey- Governor Toxie Ferd the Third, his beautiful wife Sarah, and their adorable blind, green baby, Toxie Jr. All look ahead to a glorious future for their beloved state (\"A Brand New Day in New Jersey\").",

        "title": "Godspell",
        "description": "Godspell is a musical in two acts with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by John-Michael Tebelak . The show is structured as a series of parables , primarily based on the Gospel of Matthew , interspersed with music mostly set to lyrics from traditional hymns , with the passion of Christ appearing briefly near the end.\n\nGodspell began as a project by drama students at Carnegie Mellon University and then moved to the off-off-Broadway theater La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan . The show was rescored for an off-Broadway production, which opened on May 17, 1971, and became a long-running success. Many productions have followed worldwide, including a 2011 Broadway revival. An abbreviated one-act version of the musical designed for performers aged 18 and under also exists, titled Godspell Junior .\n\nSeveral cast albums have been released over the years. \" Day by Day \", from the original cast album, reached #13 on the pop singles chart Billboard Hot 100 in the summer of 1972 and #7 in Canada's RPM 100 Singles chart.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe show opens with the \"Opening (Monologue)\", as God 's voice, spoken by Jesus , declaring his supremacy: \"My name is Known: God and King. I am most in majesty, in whom no beginning may be and no end.\" The cast then enters and takes the roles of various philosophers who sing their philosophies, first alone, then in cacophonous counterpoint (\"Prologue: Tower of Babble\").\n\nIn response, John the Baptist enters blowing a shofar to call the community to order. He then beckons them to \"Prepare Ye, The Way of the Lord!\" and baptizes the cast (\"Prepare Ye\"). John gives a short sermon, as Jesus watches quietly. Jesus then announces his presence and says that he also wishes to be baptized. John instead asks to be baptized by Jesus. Jesus explains that \"We do well now to conform with all that God requires\" and is baptized by John. The cast enters and sings with Jesus (\"Save the People\").\n\nIn his first parable , Jesus explains that he has come \"not to abolish the law and the prophets, but to complete.\" Jesus explains to the cast that those who adhere to the law of God will earn the highest place in the Kingdom of Heaven. He tells them the parable of the Widow and the Judge , demonstrating that God is a just jurist who will support those who cry out to him.\n\nThe cast begins to understand Jesus' teachings and take it upon themselves to tell the story of the Pharisee and the Publican praying in the temple: \"Every man who humbles himself shall be exalted!\"\n\nAs Jesus teaches the law of the offering gifts at the altar, the cast makes offerings of themselves. They are taught that to approach God's altar, they must be pure of heart and soul. They then act out the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant , a story of a master and a servant who owes him a debt. The servant asks his master for pity in repaying the debt, and the master absolves it. The servant then turns to a fellow servant who \"owed him a few dollars\" and demands that it be paid in full. The master, hearing this, then condemns the servant to prison. Jesus explains the moral: \"Forgive your brothers from your heart.\" The character telling the parable sings \"Day by Day\", and the cast joins in. After the song, Jesus teaches that if one part of you offends God, it is better to lose it than to have the whole of the body thrown into hell.\n\nThe cast then plays charades to finish several statements posed by Jesus, including \"If a man sues you for your shirt...\" and \"If a man asks you to go one mile with him....\" The cast then performs the Parable of the Good Samaritan as a play-within-a-play . Jesus explains the need to \"love your enemies\" and \"not make a show of religion before men\". He says: \"God will reward a good deed done in secret\" (\"Shhh! It's a secret!\").\n\nThe cast then performs the parable of Lazarus and the rich man. On earth, the rich man feasts, and Lazarus begs and is ignored. Upon dying, Lazarus is rewarded with Heaven, while the rich man is in Hell. The audience is told to \"Learn Your Lessons Well\" or be faced with eternal damnation. When the rich man asks Abraham if he would send Lazarus back from the dead to warn his brothers of their impending doom, Abraham tells him no: \"If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone should rise from the dead.\"\n\nJesus teaches that no man can serve two masters (God and money). A member of the cast tells a story of a man who spent a lifetime acquiring the good things in life, then dies before he has the time to enjoy them. This character sings \"Bless the Lord,\" then Jesus tells the cast not to worry about tomorrow: \"Tomorrow will take care of itself. Today has problems of its own.\"\n\nIn an antiphonic chorus, the cast recites the Beatitudes . Judas directs the final beatitude regarding persecution at Jesus, and Jesus quickly changes the subject (\"Did I ever tell you that I used to read feet?\"). However, Jesus then persuades the cast that it is \"All for the Best\" and heaven contains the ultimate reward as Jesus and Judas do a soft shoe together.\n\nThis is followed by the parable of the Sower of the Seeds , which Jesus tells them represent the Word of God (\"All Good Gifts\").\n\nBy this point in the musical, the group has transformed from a rag-tag cast, into a community of love and caring and now march as soldiers in the military, signifying their ability to think as one. With Jesus as the drill sergeant, they perform the Parable of the Prodigal Son . The cast sings \"Light of the World\" about Christ's Light and how it shines in each person.\n\n### Intermission\n\nJesus thanks the audience for coming and announces a 10-minute intermission .\n\nThere is audience interaction during intermission. In the original production, the cast joined the audience for wine and bread. In the 2011 Broadway revival, the audience was offered wine on the stage.\n\nThe second act then opens with one or more cast members singing \"Learn Your Lessons Well\", calling the audience back to their seats.\n\n### Act II\n\nAfter the reprise of \"Learn Your Lessons Well\", a member of the cast sings \"Turn Back, O Man\", imploring humankind to give up its temporal pursuits and turn to God. Jesus then says: \"This is the beginning.\"\n\nSeveral members of the cast then begin to question Jesus's authority, and he responds with yet another parable. He is asked, \"What is the greatest commandment?\" and responds, \"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul... And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'\" The Pharisees continue to question him, and he laments \"Alas for You\" and calls them hypocrites. Members of the cast gather, join in Jesus' song, and throw garbage at the Pharisees.\n\nJesus predicts that he will not be seen for quite a while, while standing at the \" Wailing Wall \", and predicts great wars and famines. He reminds the cast and audience of the time of Noah and teaches that faith can calm the storm. The cast is told: \"Keep awake, then. For the Son of Man will come at a time when you least expect it.\"\n\nOne woman in the cast is shunned as an adulteress . Jesus says: \"Let the one of you who is faultless cast the first stone.\" Her accusers then bow their heads and walk away. Jesus walks over to her and asks: \"Woman... where are they now? Has no one condemned you?\" The woman answers: \"No one, sir.\" He tells her: \"Then nor shall I. You may go, but do not sin again.\" As she watches Jesus walk from her, she entreats him to remain (\"By My Side\"). During this song, Judas foretells his upcoming betrayal of Jesus.\n\nIn one of the lighter moments in the second act, Jesus tells how he will separate men as a shepherd separates his flock into sheep and goats . The sheep will enter heaven while the goats must suffer eternal damnation. \"We Beseech Thee\" cry the goats, begging for mercy.\n\nAfter the song, the cast reminds each other to take things \"Day by Day\", as they remove their clown makeup, face paint, or object. They assemble for the Last Supper and Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him. Each member of the cast asks, \"Is it I?\" ending with Judas: \"Rabbi... can you mean me?\" Jesus tells him to do quickly what he must do and Judas runs off. Jesus breaks the bread and shares the wine, while saying the traditional Hebrew Seder blessings. He tells his followers that they will dine together in the Kingdom of Heaven. The band sings \"On the Willows\", which is about what has been sacrificed. In the song, Jesus blesses each member of the cast. He asks that they wait for him as he goes into the Garden of Gethsemane to pray.\n\nIn the garden, Jesus implores God to let the burden be lifted from his shoulders if there is another way. Jesus returns to his followers to find them all asleep. He begs them to stay awake, but they all fall asleep again and Jesus warns them they will all betray him three times (a reference to the apostle Peter ). Jesus then prays to God that if his death cannot pass him by, then His will must be done. He is then tempted by Satan (usually played by the apostles), but orders him away.\n\nJudas returns to betray Jesus, but has a moment where he cannot bring himself to do it. He tries to leave but finds himself boxed in by invisible walls, except for one path which leads to Jesus. Jesus encourages Judas to do what he has come to do, and Judas grabs Jesus to bring him to be crucified . The community starts to attack Judas, while Jesus tells them to stop, as all who live by the sword will one day die by it. Judas (usually alone, as a representation of the others arresting Jesus) ties Jesus upon an electric fence (representative of the cross) as Jesus berates him for arresting him at night, but then says that it had to happen to fulfill the prophets' writings.\n\nThe \"Finale\" begins, loud and in B-minor, with Jesus wailing, \"Oh, God, I'm bleeding,\" and the community answers: \"Oh, God, You're bleeding.\" Jesus dies and the music ends. The women of the cast sing \"Long Live God\", and the men join in with \"Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord\" in counterpoint. The cast removes Jesus from the fence and carries him out, either offstage or through the aisles. The cast then finishes with a reprise of \"Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord\".",
        "cast": null,
        "songs": "### Off-Broadway production\n\n### 2011 Broadway revival\n\n### Tower of Babble\n\n\"Tower of Babble,\" the show's opening number, has often been omitted in productions. The song consists of the eight disciples (or soloists) acting out as philosophers, each singing about their various philosophies. They grow increasingly more irritated with each other, sing in contradiction, and eventually run out of words. \"Prepare Ye\" follows this prologue.\n\nIn the original productions, the philosophers were Socrates ( Jeffrey Mylett ), Thomas Aquinas (Peggy Gordon), Martin Luther (Lamar Alford), Leonardo da Vinci ( Gilmer McCormick ), Edward Gibbon ( Sonia Manzano ), Jean-Paul Sartre (Joanne Jonas), Friedrich Nietzsche (Robin Lamont), and Buckminster Fuller (Herb Braha). In the 2001 revival, Luther, Gibbon, Nietzsche, and Fuller were replaced by Galileo Galilei , Jonathan Edwards , L. Ron Hubbard , and Marianne Williamson , respectively. The 2011 revival retains Galilei, Hubbard, and Williamson, but restores Gibbon and replaces da Vinci with Georg Hegel .\n\nOn many early cast recordings, including the original off-Broadway recording and the original London recording, the prologue was omitted in order to produce an album that could sell as a pop album. This omission was for marketing purposes and was not meant to diminish the importance of the number, as Stephen Schwartz has repeatedly stated. As a consequence, some audiences have gotten the impression that this number was added into the score later.\n\n### Beautiful City\n\n\"Beautiful City\" was written in 1972 as part of the film and re-written in 1993 after the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles . In the film, it follows \"Alas for You\" and \"By My Side\", omitting the parable typically found in between these two numbers.\n\nIn the decades following the film's release, many directors have chosen to use the lyrics from the original film version, sometimes to replace the \"Day by Day\" reprise, \"Tower of Babble\", like the prologue, or adding it the end of the musical as an additional scene depicting the Resurrection.\n\nThe 2011 Broadway revival places \"Beautiful City\" after \"We Beseech Thee\" and just before the Last Supper, sung by Jesus as a slow ballad. This production used the revised 1993 lyrics and is included on its cast recording, along with a cover by John Ondrasik of Five For Fighting as a bonus track.\n\nSome productions use both the original upbeat film version as a prologue as well as the ballad version, either in its original place just before the Last Supper whereupon the \"Day by Day\" reprise is used as the Resurrection, or as an epilogue depicting the resurrection itself.\n\nIn Music Theatre International 's Broadway Junior series, which edits popular musicals to one act appropriate for a middle school cast, \"Beautiful City\" is included in the show. Godspell Junior contains most of the first act and almost none of the second act. \"By My Side\" is omitted entirely. \"Beautiful City\" is placed at the beginning of the second act and is immediately followed by the Last Supper, the Betrayal, and the Crucifixion.",

        "description": "Hairspray is an American musical with music by Marc Shaiman and lyrics by Shaiman and Scott Wittman , with a book by Mark O'Donnell and Thomas Meehan , based on John Waters 's 1988 film of the same name . The songs include 1960s-style dance music and \"downtown\" rhythm and blues . Set in 1962 Baltimore , Maryland , the production follows teenage Tracy Turnblad's dream to dance on The Corny Collins Show , a local TV dance program based on the real-life Buddy Deane Show . When Tracy wins a role on the show, she becomes a celebrity overnight, leading to social change as Tracy campaigns for the show's integration.\n\nThe musical opened in Seattle in 2002 and moved to Broadway later that year. In 2003, Hairspray won eight Tony Awards , including one for Best Musical , out of 13 nominations. It ran for 2,642 performances , and closed on January 4, 2009. Hairspray has also had national tours, a West End production, and numerous foreign productions and was adapted as a 2007 musical film . The London production was nominated for a record-setting eleven Laurence Olivier Awards , winning four, including Best New Musical .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIt is June 1962 in Baltimore . Tracy Turnblad, an overweight high school student, wakes up (\" Good Morning Baltimore \") and goes to school, where she receives a warning for \"inappropriate hair height\". After school, Tracy rushes home with her best friend, Penny, to catch the local teenage dance show, The Corny Collins Show (\"The Nicest Kids in Town\"). Edna, Tracy's shy and overweight mother, is ironing and complains about the noise of the music coming from the television, while Penny's mother, Prudy, complains about it being \"race music\". After an announcement that auditions for a place on the show will be held because Brenda (one of the Corny Collins Council Members) has taken a leave of absence from the show for \"nine months\", Tracy begs her mother for permission to audition. Fearing that Tracy will be laughed at due to her weight, Edna refuses. Penny and Amber (the main dancer on The Corny Collins Show ) have similar arguments with their mothers (\"Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now\").\n\nAfter gaining permission and support from her father, Wilbur, Tracy auditions for the show and bumps into a teenage heartthrob, Link Larkin, which leads into a dream sequence (\" I Can Hear the Bells \"). Velma Von Tussle, the racist producer of The Corny Collins Show , rejects Tracy at the audition because of her size (\" (The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs \"), and rejects a black girl, Little Inez.\n\nBack at school, Tracy is sent to detention for her \"monumental hair-don't\". There she meets black dancer Seaweed J. Stubbs (the son of the hostess of \"Negro Day\" on The Corny Collins Show , Motormouth Maybelle), who teaches her several dance moves. She uses the new dance steps at the Sophomore Hop the next day to introduce herself to Corny Collins (\" The Madison \"). After Corny sees Tracy dance, he gives her a place on the show (\"The Nicest Kids in Town\" (Reprise)). During the broadcast, Link, at Corny's suggestion, sings \"It Takes Two\" to Tracy, much to Amber's dismay. (It Takes Two). After the show, Mr. Spritzer, the show's worrisome sponsor, appeals to Velma over Tracy's appointment to the Council. Threatening to fire Corny from the show, Velma is eventually left distraught and determines to ruin Tracy (\"Velma's Revenge\").\n\nAt the Turnblad house, Edna is receiving calls from fans who saw Tracy on the show. A call comes in from Mr. Pinky, the owner of a plus-size dress shop, for an endorsement. Tracy pleads with her mother to come with her and to act as her agent although Edna has not left their apartment in years. Finally making it outside, Edna is given a huge makeover (\" Welcome to the 60's \") and Tracy becomes the shop's spokes-girl. At school, signs of Tracy's fame are evident in the schoolyard, with graffiti on the walls and Shelly, another Council Member, sporting Tracy's signature hairdo. During a game of dodgeball, a jealous Amber knocks Tracy out, and Link rushes to her side. Penny and Seaweed, who have developed a liking for each other, rush to fetch the school nurse, only to find her out sick. Seaweed, suggesting that some fun would make Tracy feel better, invites all of them to his mother's record shop for a platter party (\" Run and Tell That \").\n\nAt the shop, Tracy rallies everyone to march against the station on the following day's Mother-Daughter Day, as blacks are not allowed on the show except on the monthly Negro Day. Before they start, Motormouth Maybelle convinces the initially reluctant Edna and Wilbur to march as well. Link declined to participate for the sake of his contract with the show. During the protest, led by Motormouth, Velma calls the police and fights break out. When the police arrive on the scene, almost everyone is arrested (\"Big, Blonde and Beautiful\").\n\n### Act II\n\nAfter the march, most of the women are locked up in a women's penitentiary (\"The Big Dollhouse\"). Because of Velma's dirty tactics, the governor pardons and releases her and Amber. Wilbur bails out the rest, except Tracy, who is forced to remain in jail through another one of Velma's manipulations. Tracy is alone and wishes that Link could be with her (\"Good Morning Baltimore\" (Reprise)). Back at the Har-De-Har Hut (Wilbur's joke shop), Wilbur and Edna are left destitute because of the money it took to bail everyone out. Edna sympathizes with Tracy's dream\u2014she had dreamed of making her \"own line of queen-sized dress patterns\". Edna and Wilbur reminisce about their past and how they can never be parted from each other (\"(You're) Timeless to Me\"). During the night, Link sneaks into the jail, where he finds Tracy in solitary confinement. As Link and Tracy reunite, Penny's mother, Prudy, punishes Penny for \"going to jail without her permission\" and ties her up in her bedroom, where Seaweed comes to her rescue. Both couples declare their love (\" Without Love \"). After escaping their respective prisons, the couples seek refuge at Motormouth Maybelle's Record Shop. Tracy thinks it unfair that after all their hard work, The Corny Collins Show is still segregated. They devise a plan to integrate the show, and Motormouth remembers their long fight for equality (\" I Know Where I've Been \").\n\nOn the day of the Miss Teenage Hairspray competition, Corny Collins starts the show with a song (\"(It's) Hairspray\"). Amber shows off her talents in a bid to get more votes from the viewers (\"Cooties\"). As the results are about to be announced, Tracy stuns Amber as she makes her entrance in a magenta dress without any petticoat underneath, taking over the stage, and is joined by Link, Penny, Seaweed, Edna, Wilbur, Little Inez, Corny, and Motormouth. Tracy is declared the winner of the competition. Amber and Velma protest the results, claiming that it is all wrong. Little Inez then tries to take the crown by force when Amber refuses to hand it over, but Tracy stops her, claiming that her heart is set on something more important: Link's and her future. She then proclaims The Corny Collins Show is \"now and forevermore\" racially integrated, to much applause. When all is announced, Spritzer runs onstage thrilled with the public's response to the telecast, announces that the governor has pardoned Tracy and given her a full college scholarship, and offers Link a recording contract and Velma the position of vice president of Ultra Glow \u2013 beauty products for women of color, much to her chagrin. Prudy arrives at the station and, seeing how happy Penny is with Seaweed, accepts her daughter for who she is. At the height of the moment, the company invites Amber and Velma to join the celebration. With the station in joyous celebration, Tracy and Link cement their love with a kiss (\" You Can't Stop the Beat \").",

        "songs": "### Score revisions and additional songs\n\nHairspray went through several revisions during its pre-Broadway run in Seattle, in the process eliminating and replacing several musical numbers. In Seattle, an infomercial about safety on the road titled \"Blood on the Pavement\" followed \"The Nicest Kids in Town\", and is included on the cast album following \"You Can't Stop the Beat\". Early versions of the show featured \"Velma's Cha-Cha\" and \"The Status Quo\" (Seattle) (with its short reprise \"Rage\") during Tracy's audition and dismissal, but the team instead opted for \"(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs\". After Tracy's rejection from the Council, there was a scene in the Har-De-Har Hut in which Wilbur tried to cheer Tracy up, singing that \"It Doesn't Get Better than This\". Later replaced by the similar \"Positivity\", the scene was cut early in the Seattle tryout as it was deemed emotionally redundant.\n\nAfter Tracy eventually made it on the show, there was a song, \"The New Girl in Town\", sung first by the Councilettes and later by the Black girls. Although cut during the Seattle tryout, it was included in the 2007 film and appears in the show's instrumental score. \"The Mother-Daughter Cha-Cha-Cha\" was another cut number that originally followed \"Big, Blonde, and Beautiful\".  Later, the writers absorbed the protest rally and Mother-Daughter Day into the number, thus deleting the song and folding the sequence into a single scene. A song called \"Step on Up\" was also cut in favor of \"I Know Where I've Been\". Early on in the genesis of the show, the plot involved a \"Miss Auto Show\" competition, as in the 1988 film, instead of \"Miss Teenage Hairspray\". For this competition, later revised due to the cost of cars onstage, there was a song called \"Take a Spin\" sung by Corny in the place of \"(It's) Hairspray\". After Amber's rendition of \"Cooties\", Tracy had a song before the finale, \"It Ain't Over 'Til the Fat Lady Sings\", that was cut after readings of the show; it was included as a track on the Special Edition of the 2007 motion picture's soundtrack.",

It is based on the 1928 Joseph Moncure March narrative poem of the same name . The Broadway production coincidentally opened during the same theatrical season (1999\u20132000) as an off-Broadway musical with the same title and source material .\n\nThe show is presented as a series of vaudeville sketches, complete with signs at the beginning and the end (but abandoned for most of the show) announcing the next scene propped on an easel at the side of the stage. Queenie and Burrs, whose relationship is disintegrating, host a party fueled by bathtub gin , cocaine , and uninhibited sexual behavior . It quickly devolves into an orgy that culminates in tragedy . The guests include fading star Dolores; Kate, Queenie's best friend and rival; Black, Kate's younger lover, who has his eye on Queenie; Jackie, a rich, \"ambisextrous\" kid who has his eye on everyone, regardless of gender or age; Oscar and Phil D'Armano, a gay couple/brother act; lesbian stripper Miss Madelaine True and her morphine-addicted girlfriend Sally; Black prizefighter Eddie, his white wife Mae and Mae's underaged Lolita -like sister, Nadine.",
        "synopsis": "The Vaudeville The company recounts the story of Queenie, a blonde who works as a showgirl in the Vaudeville, who is attracted to \"violent and vicious\" men (\"Queenie Was A Blonde\"). She is currently living with a man named Burrs, who works in the same vaudeville, as the act after her. His act is a minstrel show, where he performs in black face (\"Marie Is Tricky\"). One Sunday, Queenie wakes up restless and she and Burrs soon come to blows. To try to put less strain on their relationship (and to convince her to put a knife down), Burrs suggest they throw a huge party and invite \"all the old gang\". Queenie is ecstatic and they get prepared for the evening (\"Wild Party\").\n\nPromenade of Guests The guests soon arrive and exchange words with Burrs, and alcohol starts flowing (\"Dry\"). Queenie makes her appearance in a \"new\" dress (\"My Beautiful Blonde\"), and welcomes everyone, meeting Nadine, a minor who wants to be a blonde and drink bathtub gin (\"Welcome To My Party\"). Queenie takes her under her wing as she mingles with the other guests. Madelaine, an \"almost famous\" stripper, introduces Queenie to her new girlfriend, the catatonic morphine-addicted Sally, who she met crawling outside the theatre in a drugged stupor. Madelaine believes Sally is a \"post-modernist\", to which Burrs replies \"in need of a post mortem\".\n\nMadelaine tells Queenie of their love and of Sally's genius (\"Like Sally\"). Next up is Jackie, an \"ambisextrous\" rich kid with his eye on anybody and everybody (\"Breezin' Through Another Day\"). The incestuously devoted D'Armono Brothers, Oscar and Phil sing a new ditty as Gold and Goldberg, two would-be producers, arrive. They are planning to move uptown, and Burrs is convinced that they want to take him. He joins in with the brothers to impress them (\"Uptown\").\n\nQueenie wonders where her friend Kate is, and Burrs expresses his dislike for her. Eddie, a successful black boxer and his white wife Mae talk of their marriage (\"Eddie and Mae\"). Dolores, a faded star, hints to Burrs that she knows his secrets, and forces him to introduce her to Gold and Goldberg. The producers are fighting over their name (With Gold wanting to change Goldberg's name to \"Golden\" to hide their Jewish heritage) and how to become successful (\"Gold and Goldberg\"). Burrs introduces them to Dolores, who begins to seduce them with her feminine wiles (\"Moving Uptown\").\n\nThe Party Queenie starts a dance to raise the energy (\"Black Bottom\"), but Kate soon interrupts with her arrival. She has come with Mr. Black, an attractive gigolo. Queenie and Kate trade insults and love, telling Nadine of their double-edged friendship (\"Best Friend\").\n\nBurrs and Kate do not get along, with Kate disapproving of Queenie's romantic entanglement with him, while Queenie and Black begin to feel an attraction to each other. Meanwhile, Jackie tries to separate the D'Armano brothers, flirting with Oscar (\"A Little M-M-M\"). Dolores hints to Queenie about troubles in Burrs' past (\"Everybody Has Their Secrets\") while Nadine sings a paean to Broadway, only to be cut off by Queenie (\"The Lights Of Broadway\").\n\nQueenie and Black meet up and find their attraction growing stronger (\"Tabu\"). Queenie asks him to show her how he picks up ladies, and his hypothetical soon turns into a real proposition (\"Takin' Care Of The Ladies\") and he pulls her up to dance (\"Tabu Dance\"). Kate and Burrs notice how close Queenie and Black are becoming, and Burrs wonders about the demise of fidelity (\"Wouldn't It Be Nice?\"). Queenie tells Black of her troubled existence, wondering why she was born (\"Lowdown-Down\"), as Burrs hypes up the party with Gin (\"Gin\").\n\nThe party quickly escalates, with everybody drinking, dancing, and arguing. Dolores warns Queenie of Burrs' first wife, who he beat to death, and Queenie escapes to the bathroom. There, she in confronted by Burrs of her entanglement with Black, and he begins to assault her. Kate barges in and saves Queenie, and Burrs furiously rejoins the party with a coked-up Jackie. Kate and Queenie argue about her relationship with Burrs, as Jackie and Oscar are found having sex in the bathroom.\n\nOscar and Phil argue publicly, while Mae and Eddie exchange heated words. Kate warns Queenie that Burrs will kill her, and when Queenie refuses to listen, Kate jumps back into the party. Eddie and Mae soon come to blows - hitting each other, as Dolores seduces Gold and Goldberg, bringing them into the bedroom. Distraught with the state of the party, Queenie is dragged out by Black, as the party continues in full swing (\"Wild\"). Madelaine searches for Sally and asks her to say her name. The guests all gather and culminate in an orgy (\"Need\") as Burrs asks Kate about Black. Kate reveals that she knows Black is using her, but she is fine with it (\"Black Is A Moocher\").\n\nOutside, Queenie and Black bond at the fact that they are different from the rest, wondering where they belong and what will become of them (\"People Like Us\").\n\nAfter Midnight Dies Sally, naked, carrying her clothes, reveals she can see clearly now what she and everyone else is (\"After Midnight Dies\"). She finds Eddie recounting how it feels to beat someone acclaimed, but still be detested (\"Golden Boy\").\n\nShe notices Oscar and Phil making up, and turns to find Gold and Goldberg, pants nowhere to be found, wondering what has happened to them. Dolores appears and warns them that their promise must be kept, or terrible things will occur (\"The Movin' Uptown Blues\"). She then sneaks into the bedroom, where Nadine has just done her first line of coke with Jackie (\"The Lights Of Broadway (Reprise)\"). At Nadine's request for more, Jackie laments how he can never get enough of anything, culminating in rape (\"More\").\n\nMae hears Nadine's muffled screams and Eddie charges in and beats Jackie. Eddie goes wild, threatening everyone as Queenie and Black arrive. When Eddie charges at Queenie, Black hits him. Queenie questions Nadine on what had happened with Jackie, but she refuses to call him out, instead saying she was scared and screamed. Jackie tries to start the party up again and takes out more cocaine. Seeing the coke, Sally goes to him, leaving Madelaine. Madelaine chases after her, but is stopped when Sally asks, \"Who's Sally?\"\n\nThe guests are told to leave by Burrs, and they disappear into the background. Kate confronts Black, telling him that Queenie will choose Burrs and he will have nowhere to go. Burrs and Queenie come to blows as she reveals she knows about his wife (\"Love Ain't Nothin'/Welcome To Her Party\").\n\nQueenie refuses to let Burrs make up her mind (\"What I Need\") and leaves with Black. Burrs wonders how many other women could make him feel the way she does, before concluding it is just her (\"How Many Women In The World?\"). Gold and Goldberg tell him they had no intention of taking him uptown with them, and he begins to put on his vaudeville makeup. Dolores recounts how she used to love the dark, but now she loves the cold hard light that spares no one. She enjoys knowing who has the stuff and who doesn't to survive (\"When It Ends\").\n\nFinale Queenie and Black lie in bed as Queenie wonders what it is to live in light and love (\"This Is What It Is\"). Burrs, done up in blackface, mimics the guests, before entering the bedroom (\"Marie Is Tricky (Reprise)\"). He pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Queenie (\"How Many Women In The World? (Reprise)\").\n\nBlack fights back and Burrs is shot dead and falls on the bed. Kate rushes in and hurries Black to safety. The company does the opening vaudeville, trying to lure Queenie into its revelry (\"Queenie Was A Blonde (Reprise)\").\n\nQueenie tries, but soon begins to take off her makeup, the company dropping the vaudeville and joining her (\"This Is What It Is\" (Reprise)). Queenie is bathed in morning light. Scared, unsure but hopeful, she smiles at the dawn.",

        "description": "The Woodsman is a 2012 American stage play (described on the official website as a \"dramatico-musical\") written by James Ortiz with music composed by Edward W. Hardy and lyrics by Jennifer Loring. It focuses on the story of the Tin Woodman character from L. Frank Baum 's series of books set in the fictional Land of Oz , notably Baum's 1918 book The Tin Woodman of Oz . The production employs live performers, puppets, music, and very few spoken words.\n\nConceived by Strangemen Theatre Company, originally created by James Ortiz & Diana Stahl and produced by Steven Laing & Jason Ralph , the show debuted in 2012 at Standard ToyKraft in Brooklyn, followed by a 2013 run at the Ars Nova ANT Fest.  It has been produced Off-Broadway at 59E59 Theaters in 2014 and 2015, and at New World Stages in 2016. In 2019, a limited run was produced at the Bluebarn Theatre in Omaha, Nebraska. There has been one high school production, produced by Timpview High School in April of 2025.\n\nThe play has received critical praise, and won a 2016 Obie Award for Ortiz's puppet design.

On September 2, 2016, a filmed performance of the work was broadcast by PBS stations, as part of the Theater Close-Up series produced by WNET in association with BroadwayHD .",
        "synopsis": "The play focuses on the story of Nick Chopper, a mortal woodsman who will eventually become the Tin Woodman in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . In eastern section of the Land of Oz , Munchkin Country , the Munchkins live in fear of their master the Wicked Witch of the East . The Witch's rule has made everyone afraid to speak aloud \u2013 to that end, the play is almost entirely wordless, with the characters instead communicating through noise and mime. Two Munchkins brave the dangerous forest to try to find safety in Emerald City on the other side, but after finding a safe clearing decide to settle down in the woods instead. As they age, they give birth to Nick Chopper, who after their deaths inherits his father's practice as a woodsman and a locket belonging to his mother, along with their hope to eventually reach the Emerald City.\n\nThe Witch has in her captivity a Munchkin named Nimmie, the daughter of a Munchkin sorcerer, who is forced to serve as the Witch's servant. Sent into the woods to retrieve items for the Witch, Nimmie is ambushed by a vicious Kalidah creature, but is saved by Nick. The Kalidah creature can be described as the body of a bear and the head of a tiger. The pair having never seen another Munchkin, they quickly grow intrigued by each other: Nick shows off his skills with his axe and teaches Nimmie how to use it. They gradually fall for each other as Nick gifts Nimmie his mother's locket, but Nimmie recalls her mission and returns to the Witch. However, the Witch notices the locket and attempts to take it from Nimmie: Nimmie uses her latent powers of sorcery as well as her bravery she learned from Nick to fight the Witch into submission and escape. She reunites with Nick and the two become lovers.\n\nHowever, the Witch tracks down Nick and Nimmie while they are asleep and places a curse on his axe which causes him to lose pieces of himself every time he uses it. A group of Winkies, the Tinsmiths, help him by replacing each of his severed limbs with metal parts. Nimmie tries to stop Nick from continuing to chop, but he is dedicated to continue to chop to build their home and get married: eventually, the axe completely tears him to pieces. Nimmie recovers his parts and pleads with the Winkies for help, breaking her silence in the process. The Winkies build Nick a new body out of tin, and Nimmie uses her powers to revive him. However, realizing he lacks a heart and feeling he can no longer love Nimmie, Nick chooses to leave her. The Witch invites a devastated Nimmie to return to her, but Nimmie rejects her and vanishes into the woods alone. In the play's only song with lyrics, \"Rusting Tin Man\", the Woodsman devotes his existence to chopping wood in the field as the spirits of his parents sadly watch on. Eventually, his memories of Nimmie fade as he rusts until he is completely unable to move.\n\nSome time later, the Witch is crushed when a house falls from the sky, and a girl emerges, venturing into Oz.",

        "synopsis": "Act I\n\nVernon Hines, the efficiency expert at the Sleep-Tite Pajama Factory in Cedar Rapids , Iowa , breaks the fourth wall to introduce the story (\"The Pajama Game Opening\"). Inside the factory, workers churn out pajamas at a backbreaking pace (\"Racing with the Clock\"). In the middle of this, Sid Sorokin has come from out of town to work in the factory as the new superintendent (\"A New Town Is a Blue Town\"). The union , led by Prez, is seeking a wage raise of seven-and-a-half cents an hour, though the company president, Myron Hasler, refuses to give way. Katherine \"Babe\" Williams is the leader of the Union Grievance Committee. Sid and Babe are in opposite camps, yet romantic interest is sparked at their first encounter. Despite cajoling from her fellow garment workers, Babe appears to reject Sid (\"I'm Not At All in Love\"). Meanwhile, Hines is in love with Gladys Hotchkiss, the company president's secretary , but is pushing her away with his jealous behavior. After witnessing a fight between the couple, Sid's secretary, Mabel, tries to help Hines break from his jealous ways (\"I'll Never Be Jealous Again\"). Meanwhile, Sid, rejected again by Babe, is forced to confide his feelings to a dictaphone (\"Hey There\").\n\nDuring the annual company picnic, kicked off with the official Sleep-Tite Company Anthem (\"Sleep-Tite\"), Hines demonstrates his knife throwing act while intoxicated, almost striking Babe while attempting to knock an apple off her head. Prez chases after Gladys, who rejects his advances (\"Her Is\"). Babe warms up to Sid, and they turn the entire picnic into a celebratory dance (\"Once a Year Day\"). As the picnic-goers head home, Prez turns his attentions to Mae, who responds in the positive far more quickly and aggressively than he'd expected (\"Her Is (Reprise)\"). At Babe's home, Sid's romantic overtures are deflected by Babe, who makes casual conversation on tangential subjects (\"Small Talk\"). Eventually the walls come down between the two, who admit their love for one another (\"There Once Was a Man\"), but their estrangement is reinforced when they return to the factory. A slow-down is staged by the union, strongly supported by Babe (\"Racing with the Clock (Reprise)\"). Sid, as factory superintendent, demands an \"honest day's work\" and threatens to fire slackers. Babe, however, is still determined to fight for their cause, and intentionally jams the factory line, causing a breakdown, and Sid reluctantly fires her. As she leaves, he begins to wonder again whether a romance with her is a mistake (\"Hey There (Reprise)\").\n\nAct II\n\nAt the Union meeting, after a rallying speech by Prez, Gladys (Mae in the 2006 revival) performs for the rest of the union, with \"the boys from the cutting room floor\" (\"Steam Heat\"). After the main meeting, the Grievance Committee meets at Babe's house, to discuss further tactics, such as mismatching sizes of pajamas and sewing the fly-buttons onto the bottoms such that they are likely to come off and leave their wearer pants-less. At the meeting, as Prez and Mae's relationship is waning, Sid arrives and tries to smooth things over with Babe. Despite her feelings for Sid, she pushes him away (\"Hey There (Reprise)\").\n\nBack at the factory, the girls reassure Hines, who is personally offended by the slow down, that he is doing nothing wrong (\"Think of the Time I Save\"). Hasler has a meeting in his office with Max, one of the company's traveling salesmen, about an incident that occurred in Peoria , Illinois . Hines is called in to try on pajama pants, which fall down in front of everybody just as Gladys walks in. Believing that he is fooling around, she angrily dismisses him. Sid, now convinced that Babe's championship of the union is justified, takes Gladys out for the evening to a night club , Hernando's Hideaway (\"Hernando's Hideaway\"), where he wheedles the key to the company's books from her. Hines and Babe each discover the pair and assume they are becoming romantically involved. Babe storms out, and Hines believes his jealous imaginings have come true (\"I'll Never Be Jealous Again Ballet\").\n\nUsing Gladys' key, Sid accesses the firm's books and discovers that Hasler has already tacked on the extra seven and one-half cents to the production cost, but has kept all the extra profits for himself. Hines, still jealous out of his mind, has broken into Gladys' office, and flings knives past Sid and Gladys, narrowly missing an increasingly paranoid Mr. Hasler. After detaining Hines, Sid then brings about Hasler's consent to a pay raise and rushes to bring the news to the Union Rally, already in progress (\"7\u00bd Cents\"). This news brings peace to the factory and to his love life, allowing him to reconnect with Babe (\"There Once Was a Man (Reprise)\"). Everyone goes out to celebrate at Hernando's Hideaway clothed in company brand pajamas (\"The Pajama Game Finale\").",

In the 2006 revival, the number was made with Mae (Joyce Chittick), instead of Gladys. Kathleen Marshall explains: \"Hines accuses Gladys of being a flirt, and she's not. So does it make sense that she'd go and strut her stuff in front of the whole union? Hines would say, 'Aha, you floozy, I caught you!' Also, she's the boss's secretary, so why would she be at a union meeting? I think it's much more fun that Gladys doesn't really let go until she goes out with Sid, gets real drunk, and throws caution to the wind.\"\n\nWords and music by Richard Adler; in 2006, Hines (Michael McKean) performed the new number, \"The Three of Us\" at show's end with Gladys (Megan Lawrence). At the time of the revival, Adler was quoted as saying that he wrote the song for Jimmy Durante in 1964. \"It was written for Jimmy Durante\", says McKean, \"and Durante used to do it in his act, but he never recorded it, so it's kind of an orphan.\"  The song was actually featured in the 1966 television musical, Olympus 7-000 , part of the ABC Stage 67 series which also produced Stephen Sondheim 's Evening Primrose .  Eddie Foy Jr. (who had played Hines in the original Broadway and movie versions of The Pajama Game ) introduced the song in Olympus 7-000 and sings it on the Command Records soundtrack album . Donald O'Connor , Larry Blyden and Phyllis Newman co-starred in the TV special with Foy. [ citation needed ]\n\n\"The World Around Us\" was part of the 1954 Broadway previews and opening, but was dropped during the first week of the Broadway run, replaced by Babe's reprise of \"Hey There\".  This would leave Sid with no songs in the second act, aside from the reprise of \"There Once was a Man\". The number was restored for the 2006 Broadway revival, allowing star Harry Connick Jr. to have a second-act song.\n\nWords and music by Richard Adler; for the 1973 revival, in place of the second-act \"Hey There\" reprise, there was a new song, \"Watch Your Heart\". Retitled \"If You Win, You Lose\", the song has been included in recent productions of the show and was in the 2006 Broadway production.",

        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nThe curtain opens onto a stage that is empty except for a single ghost light as the overture comes to a close. Ladahlord, an unusual man, enters and welcomes the crowd to accompany him and watch a peculiar, genuine story unfurl. In \"Right Before Your Eyes,\" he describes the adventure they are about to experience. The scene moves to James's bedroom at the Painswick Orphanage in London, England in 1959, where he sleeps with a scarf and glasses under his pillow. His parents were tragically killed by an escaped rhinoceros, so the scarf and glasses are all he has of them left. James recalls the tragedy in his dreams as he drifts off to sleep. He wakes up and clings to the scarf and glasses. A grasshopper and a ladybug (both puppets) enter; James calls them and promises not to hurt them. Since this is not the right place for them, James asks them to leave; He, on the other hand, has nowhere else to go, so he must remain. In \"On Your Way Home\", he wishes he could fly away with the ladybug and grasshopper to a warm and welcoming place where he belongs. James is informed that he is leaving the orphanage when the Matron Nurse comes in. It just so happens, he has two aunties residing in Dover - where James is initially from - who will take him in. James is told by the Matron Nurse that he cannot return to the orphanage, so he must follow their orders.\n\nIn Dover , we track down James' aunts, Spiker and Sponge on the footpath, picking pockets. They extol the virtues of the criminal profession they have chosen. Through charitable contributions to the police, they are able to continue their criminal activities without being caught. They receive a telegram from a passing Bobby-Cop informing them that James will be moving in with them. They are unsure of what to do with a child at first, but when they discover that they can make James their slave, they are overjoyed with their most recent purchase (\"Property of Spiker and Sponge\"). James is picked up at the train station by Spiker and Sponge. They promise the Matron Nurse that they will take good care of him, but they show him their true colors as soon as she leaves. James will live in the cellar when they take him home, which is a run-down cottage with an overgrown garden. The scarf and glasses, James's last remembrances of his parents, are then taken away by Spiker and Sponge, but James recovers them. His aunties let him know that the main explanation they have taken him in is so he can be their slave... furthermore, they then, at that point, immediately order him to chop down an old peach tree in the yard. A spider suddenly appears. Sponge eats it after Spiker kills it. James asks if they can go to the beach after seeing the seashore and his old friends from a distance. That's a great idea to Spiker and Sponge, but they go to the beach without James! In \"Right before Your Eyes \u2013 Reprise 2,\" Ladahlord reminds the audience that a magic spell is about to happen. An earthworm and a centipede, both puppets, appear just as James is about to cut down the peach tree, despite feeling sorry for himself. The centipede pursues the worm, yet James mediates. James frightens the centipede. As James pursues the centipede, he collides with Ladahlord, who gives James an enchanted book with recipes for elixirs in it. In \"Shake It Up,\" Ladahlord promises that if James chooses a spell from the book and consumes the potion, amazing and unbelievable things will occur. James selects crocodile tongues that slither as his spell. After James assists him with the spell, Ladahlord instructs him to consume the crocodile tongues by mixing them with water. He cautions James that whomever meets the crocodile tongues first will get the enchantment. James rushes to the well in search of water, but he trips and drops the bag's contents. The crocodile tongues pursue a grasshopper, a spider, a ladybug and a centipede.\n\nWhen Spiker and Sponge return to the garden to find James, they are surprised to discover that the old peach tree has sprouted a peach, something that hasn't happened in years. The peach becomes increasingly larger. Sponge wants to eat it, yet Spiker won't let her... she realizes that individuals will pay cash to see such a peculiarity. Soon, journalists, Hollywood agents, and garden guild members arrive to see the magic peach. Spiker and Sponge realize that they won't do anything to earn a gazillion dollars. (\"There's Money on That Tree\"). Spiker and Sponge sign a number of contracts and receive substantial cash advances to use the peach in the future. James inquires if they can use the entire sum to relocate to the coast or travel. James points out that he was the one who made the peach grow, but Spiker and Sponge make it clear that they do not intend to include James in their wealth. His aunties call him a liar, taking and obliterating the last relics of his folks, at long last, letting him know that he should rest outside and insulting him that he can't take off, in light of the fact that he has no place else to go. James recognizes that he is stuck and needs to make a choice. He enters the peach (\"Middle of a Moment\") after spotting a door and leaving both his past and present behind.\n\nInside the peach, James experiences the bugs that ate the crocodile tongues. They are currently completely developed, human-sized animals that can talk. While Spider, Ladybug, Grasshopper, and Earthworm are more accepting, Centipede is wary of humans, including James. The peach suddenly moves forward. Its stem snaps from the tree, and it starts rolling ceaselessly, running over Spiker and Sponge. It travels through the village, across fields, and past a well-known chocolate factory (Our Adventure Begins!). James realizes that they are floating in the ocean when he comes out from the top of the peach. Grasshopper sings \"Floatin' Along\" to everyone, even though it's not clear where they are going (Ladybug thinks they're going to France). Earthworm and Centipede are less certain; they are concerned that they lack food and water and the peach is unsuitable for the sea. The group is on its way after Ladybug makes a sail for the peach with an additional pair of her bloomers.\n\n### Act Two\n\nThe journey has become more difficult after several days. James and the insect crew are dissatisfied, thirsty, and hungry because the bloomer sail has been ripped. They start chatting about what they're going to eat without any landmarks in sight. Centipede recommends that they eat James, yet Insect dismisses the thought. James whispers that he has an idea, but he doesn't think anyone will be interested in hearing it. He is reassured by Spider, so he suggests that they consume the peach, which will provide them with all the water and food they require. As they eat, Grasshopper fiddles a tune for them. James looks further into his bug partners, finding realities about them that he won't ever be aware... for instance, that Grasshopper's ears are on his stomach. James is encouraged to explore the world by Spider, who tells him that the world is full of strange and unfamiliar things (\"Have You Even Begun to Wonder?\").\n\nJames' aunts recover from being run over by the peach back in their garden. They are aware that, due to the fact that they have already taken the advance money, they will not be able to fulfill the contracts they have signed without the peach. In \"A Getaway for Spiker and Sponge,\" they are advised to take the money and flee when they hear police sirens and helicopters overhead.\n\nJames has another bad dream while on the peach. James discovers how vile Spiker and Sponge really are when he and the insects start telling stories about them. They not only killed and ate Spider's fiance, but they also killed the entire family of Centipede, who were the best shoemakers in the land, until Spiker and Sponge fumigated them. Centipede disagrees with James' conclusion that Spiker and Sponge were truly awful: That is how all humans are, including James! Ladybug gets some information about his folks, and he lets his new companions know that his folks are no more. Ladybug clashes: \"Everywhere That You Are\" describes how James' parents are always by his side.\n\nLadahlord enters, camouflaged as a boat's watchman (\" Right Before Your Eyes - Reprise 3\"). He serves drinks to Spiker and Sponge, who are traveling by cruise ship in first class to New York City. Spiker and Sponge have just enough money to get to New York and resume their previous habit of stealing from Coney Island's boardwalk. Even though they have lost nearly everything, they still have each other (I Got You), and they lament that they have lost the peach when they were so close to having a fortune. Spiker and Sponge suddenly see the peach floating in the ocean from the ship's deck, and they demand that the ship \"follow that peach!\" On the peach, Centipede is feeling a piece nauseous. He vomits off the peach's side, which attracts a swarm of sharks. James and the insect crew are in serious danger when the sharks start eating the peach. A group of seagulls have also been attracted to the vomit from above. James has a great idea for everyone: they will attach themselves to the seagulls and fly away using the web of Spider as a rope. However, there is only one issue: how might they get the seagulls to fly to them so they can join the rope? James has a different plan. He promises that the then hesitant Earthworm will not be hurt as he persuades him to serve as bait. Earthworm calls the seagulls despite being dissatisfied with his work. As James' arrangement works, Earthworm turns out to be more sure about his job (\"Plump and Juicy\"). The peach will soon be in the air (\"Right Before Your Eyes \u2013 Reprise 4\").\n\nCentipede is still convinced that James will turn against them, despite the fact that Earthworm is overjoyed with the outcomes of their most recent adventure. He suddenly slips and falls into the water as he clambers to the top of the peach and rails against James. While the other bugs impatiently wait to see if they will ever see either of them again, James enters to save him. James and Centipede reappear at long last. Centipede has lost all understanding regarding James; When this person put his own life in danger to save him, how can he believe that all humans are the same?\n\nAt that precise moment, they can see the Empire State Building from the top. They are aware that they have reached New York City! When they hear sirens, they realize that Spiker and Sponge are with the police on the ground attempting to bring the peach down. At first, they believe they are safe. A plane moving toward JFK Air Terminal flies through the silk strings appending the peach to the seagulls, and the peach tumbles from the sky, arriving on the tower of the Empire State Building, where it gets stuck (\"Empire State/The Attack\").\n\nSponge and Spiker hurry to James. Outwardly, they act relieved and happy to see him, but inwardly, they tell him how they will make him their slave once more\u2014after they fumigate the bugs, naturally. James stands up to them and assures them that his new family will not be harmed. Spiker and Sponge are crushed when the peach falls to the ground after there is an odd rumbling. James wonders if it's wrong for him not to be sad. The bugs console him that it is acceptable for him to feel better. Centipede bids farewell and starts to leave when James stops him. (\"On Your Way Home \u2013 Reprise\"), James tells him that he should stay with them instead of leaving on his own; After all, they are a family together. Even though they are a strange family, they accomplish amazing things: Centipede designs shoes, Spider uses her web to build bridges, and Earthworm starts an activist group called BAIT: Bugs Against Insensitive Terminology. Although Ladybug and Grasshopper get married and have their own children, they always consider James to be their first son. In \"Welcome Home,\" James goes from being the most alone child to living in the peach pit with a huge, loving family. In \"Curtain Call,\" the cast reminds the audience that this was a true story that took place right in front of them.",

The Rogers character also performs rope tricks in between scenes. The revue contains snippets of Rogers' \"homespun\" style of wisdom.",
        "synopsis": "Rogers frequently speaks directly to the audience and to Florenz Ziegfeld himself, who often interjects to question the progress of the show and to give some directorial advice.  After introducing the audience to his friends and family, Rogers discusses leaving home at 19 to become a cowboy in Argentina.  Ziegfeld tells Rogers that he must \"meet the girl\".  Although Rogers met Betty Blake at a train station, Ziegfeld creates a more \"theatrical\" meeting by having her lowered romantically from the Moon.\n\nBecause Betty is eager to marry Rogers, the show moves forward several years to a time when Rogers is playing in a small Wild West revue .  The couple is about to be married, but Ziegfeld interrupts, saying that the wedding has to be delayed, because it must occur in the first act finale.  So, as Rogers' success continues to grow, he and Betty travel around the country performing and produce four children.  Rogers gets his big break when he is invited to join the Ziegfeld Follies and, by the early 1910s, he is a big vaudeville and radio star.  He is about to leave for Hollywood to start a career in film , when it is at last time for the finale and the wedding.\n\nRogers is at the zenith of his popularity, the country's biggest and highest paid star of every medium of his time\u2013 stage, screen, radio, newspapers, and public appearances\u2013 and is even asked to run for president.  This doesn't leave him much time for Betty, and she begins to feel neglected and starts singing the blues .  Rogers comes home with \"a treasury of precious jewels,\" and all is forgiven.  The good mood doesn't last long, however, as bill collectors and creditors come knocking at the door.  Ziegfeld has lost his fortune, and the Great Depression is in full swing. Herbert Hoover asks Rogers to give a speech to the nation.  Rogers also reconciles with his estranged father.  The show ends with the fatal plane ride in Alaska that Rogers shares with Wiley Post , a character whose cheerful invitation, \"Let's go flyin' Will!\" is heard throughout the show.",

The script is based on Bell's 1918 play A Dislocated Honeymoon . The story concerns an ex-showgirl who elopes with a society boy, but his family tries to break up the marriage.  The Gershwins wrote ten songs for the musical, eight of which were used in the production, which premiered in Atlantic City, New Jersey , on March 21, 1921. It toured through several cities and ended in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania , where it closed on April 16, 1921.\n\nThe show was George Gershwin's second book musical and his first full score written with his brother Ira.  The book is believed to be lost. The show is one of the few Gershwin musicals that never made it to Broadway .  The book was revised and retitled Elsie and, later, entirely new music was written for it by Eubie Blake and others.  This version was produced on Broadway in April 1923.   Even though Elsie ran for only 40 performances, it made history as a rare early example of black songwriters writing for white performers. No one knows why director Edgar MacGregor abandoned the Gershwin score.  Several of the songs were later reused, and Ella Fitzgerald had a success in 1959 with her recording of \" Boy Wanted \".",

Frustrated and bored by their mundane lives in the town of Eastwick, a shared longing and desire for \"all manner of man in one man\" comes to life in the form of a charismatic stranger, a devil -like character, Darryl Van Horne. Seducing each of the women in turn, Darryl teaches them how to expand the powers locked within, though their new unorthodox lifestyle scandalizes the town.

        "synopsis": "Setting: the fictional Rhode Island town of Eastwick\n\nA little girl sings the praises of her little town of Eastwick, Rhode Island, which she creates using her imagination, as well as its inhabitants who describe Eastwick as a town where everyone looks through their curtains at everyone else and where gossip is more powerful than the truth (\"Eastwick Knows\"). A forced parade led by and honouring self-appointed First Lady of Eastwick, Felicia Gabriel, overtakes proceedings but as she is about to receive her prize an unexpected thunderstorm forces everyone to run home.\n\nAlexandra (Alex), Jane and Sukie, the three Witches, have retreated to Alex's living room for peanut butter brownies, martinis and begin to complain. They talk about their boredom with their current relationships which include casual sex, abstinence and Sukie's affair with Felicia's husband, Clyde. Alex's son, Michael, enters with his girlfriend, Jennifer, who also happens to be Felicia's daughter. The teenagers are disgustingly in love with each other and the Witches, seeing how happy they are, sing about the kind of man they would like in their lives (\"Make Him Mine\").\n\nIn Felicia's kitchen,  Felicia and Clyde show how truly unhappy they are and how Felicia is determined to keep her public face on their relationship. The phone rings; a man from New York has arrived and bought the deserted Lenox Mansion and is tearing down the trees in his backyard. Felicia, being the considerate soul she is, thinks of the snowy egrets that will lose their homes and decides to rally the town to stop him. Arriving at Lenox Mansion, Darryl Van Horne emerges from a puff of smoke and begins to charm all the residents except Felicia (\"I Love A Little Town\"). The \"Eastwick Preservation Society\" banner explodes in a fireball and everyone flees.\n\nDarryl meets Alexandra on the beach where she is sculpting in the sand. Embarrassed, she allows Darryl to take her back to his house. They discuss sculpture and Darryl begins his seduction (\"Eye of the Beholder\"). Gossip begins to work its way round the town and Darryl goes to Jane's studio where she is playing the cello. They discuss music and have a wild and sexual cello/violin duet which ends in the cello playing by itself and a massive musical and actual orgasm (\"Waiting For The Music To Begin\").\n\nClyde promises Sukie that he will leave Felicia but she enters with Jennifer and catches the two of them. Their excuse is that they are preparing research on Darryl and Lenox Mansion. When Sukie returns home Darryl is waiting for her. Darryl gets Sukie to break out of her introverted shell and talk to him (\"Words, Words, Words\"). Instead of sleeping with her, he invites her to a tennis game. It is only when Sukie arrives and sees Alex and Jane that all three realise that Darryl has been sleeping with all of them. He serves a ball which explodes in mid-air and says that he is the man they prayed for.\n\nMichael and Jennifer meet and sing their puppy-love duet (\"Something\") while the rest of the town meet to do laundry and gossip about Darryl and his conquests (\"Dirty Laundry\"). During the number, Felicia, to her horror, discovers Jennifer kissing Michael and immediately sends her away from Eastwick.\n\nAlex, Jane and Sukie enter, each wearing a stunning sexy dress singing about their childhood insecurities (\"I Wish I May\"). Darryl sweet talks the women and teaches them how to curse Felicia by throwing things into an enchanted cookie jar. They throw a tennis ball, a bracelet and some feathers into the jar and immediately, Felicia starts to throw up...a tennis ball, a bracelet and some feathers. Enchanted, the Witches turn to Darryl who tells them to close their eyes and suddenly they are flying high above the audience.\n\nDarryl invites Alex to Mexican Night at his house and she reflects on her single-minded pursuit (\"Another Night At Darryl\u2019s\"). At Nemo's Diner, Darryl bumps into Felicia and Clyde. He taunts her and she vomits a cherry pit. Seeing that Eastwick's men have no idea how to please their women Darryl teaches the town about how to have real sex (\"Dance With The Devil\").\n\nThe Witches go to Darryl's in coats and take them off to reveal matching lingerie. Just as they are about to have sex, Darryl's manservant, Fidel, delivers a letter from The Eastwick Preservation Society that says they are suing him for filling in the wetlands. In revenge, all four start throwing anything they can find into the cookie jar. In Felicia's kitchen, we see the result as she screams at the still bewitched Clyde (\"Evil\"). Eventually, she can no longer cope with the curse and tells Clyde to do something so he hits her with a frying pan. Suddenly free of Felicia he shouts that he is finally happy. However, with her dying breath, Felicia pulls Clyde's tie into the waste disposal unit and turns it on.\n\nThe Witches start to avoid Darryl. When they return to Lenox Mansion, they tell Darryl that he has taken it too far. Furious, he screams at them but they run away and Darryl swears revenge. On the beach, Sukie bumps into the now orphaned Jennifer. She tries to offer advice but cannot find the words (\"Loose Ends\"). Darryl enters once Sukie leaves and begins to seduce Jennifer. He tricks her into marrying him and this news prompts the Witches to send Darryl back where he belongs.\n\nBefore the wedding Darryl leads the town in singing the praises of himself (\"The Glory of Me\"). The wedding begins but the Witches appear and, using a voodoo doll of Darryl they begin attacking him (\"The Wedding\"). Vowing revenge, Darryl is thrown back to Hell in a fireball and the church collapses. Michael and Jennifer are reunited (\"Something\" Reprise) and the Witches realise the error of their ways (\"Look At Me\").",

It is based on Margaret Landon 's novel Anna and the King of Siam (1944), which is in turn derived from the memoirs of Anna Leonowens , governess to the children of King Mongkut of Siam in the early 1860s. The musical's plot relates the experiences of Anna, a British schoolteacher who is hired as part of the King's drive to modernize his country.  The relationship between the King and Anna is marked by conflict through much of the piece, as well as by a love to which neither can admit. The musical premiered on March 29, 1951, at Broadway 's St. James Theatre . It ran for nearly three years, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway musical in history at the time, and has had many tours and revivals.\n\nIn 1950, theatrical attorney Fanny Holtzmann was looking for a part for her client, veteran leading lady Gertrude Lawrence .  Holtzmann realized that Landon's book would provide an ideal vehicle and contacted Rodgers and Hammerstein , who were initially reluctant but agreed to write the musical.  The pair initially sought Rex Harrison to play the supporting part of the King, a role he had played in the 1946 film made from Landon's book, but he was unavailable.  They settled on the young actor and television director Yul Brynner .\n\nThe musical was an immediate hit, winning Tony Awards for Best Musical , Best Actress (for Lawrence) and Best Featured Actor (for Brynner). Lawrence died unexpectedly of cancer a year and a half after the opening, and the role of Anna was played by several actresses during the remainder of the Broadway run of 1,246 performances. A hit West End London run and U.S. national tour followed, together with the 1956 film for which Brynner won the Academy Award for Best Actor , and the musical was recorded several times. In later revivals, Brynner came to dominate his role and the musical, starring in a four-year national tour culminating in a 1985 Broadway run shortly before his death.\n\nChristopher Renshaw directed major revivals on Broadway (1996), winning the Tony Award for Best Revival , and in the West End (2000). A 2015 Broadway revival won another Tony for Best Revival. Both professional and amateur revivals of The King and I continue to be staged regularly throughout the English-speaking world.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nIn 1862, a strong-willed, widowed schoolteacher, Anna Leonowens, arrives in Bangkok, Siam (later known as Thailand) at the request of the King of Siam to tutor his many children.  Anna's young son, Louis, fears the severe countenance of the King's prime minister, the Kralahome, but Anna refuses to be intimidated (\" I Whistle a Happy Tune \"). The Kralahome has come to escort them to the palace, where they are expected to live \u2013 a violation of Anna's contract, which calls for them to live in a separate house.  She considers returning to Singapore aboard the vessel that brought them, but goes with her son and the Kralahome.\n\nSeveral weeks pass, during which Anna and Louis are confined to their palace rooms.  The King receives a gift from the king of Burma, a lovely slave girl named Tuptim, to be one of his many wives.  She is escorted by Lun Tha, a scholar who has come to copy a design for a temple, and the two are secretly in love.  Tuptim, left alone, declares that the King may own her, but not her heart (\"My Lord and Master\").  The King gives Anna her first audience. The schoolteacher is a part of his plan for the modernization of Siam; he is impressed when she already knows this.  She raises the issue of her house with him, he dismisses her protests and orders her to talk with his wives.  They are interested in her, and she tells them of her late husband, Tom (\"Hello, Young Lovers\").  The King presents her new pupils; Anna is to teach those of his children whose mothers are in favor with him \u2013 several dozen \u2013 and is to teach their mothers as well.  The princes and princesses enter in procession (\"March of the Royal Siamese Children\").  Anna is charmed by the children, and formality breaks down after the ceremony as they crowd around her.\n\nAnna has not given up on the house, and teaches the children proverbs and songs extolling the virtues of home life, to the King's irritation.  The King has enough worries without battling the schoolteacher, and wonders why the world has become so complicated (\"A Puzzlement\").  The children and wives are hard at work learning English (\"The Royal Bangkok Academy\").  The children are surprised by a map showing how small Siam is compared with the rest of the world (\" Getting to Know You \").  As the crown prince , Chulalongkorn, disputes the map, the King enters a chaotic schoolroom.  He orders the pupils to believe the teacher but complains to Anna about her lessons about \"home\".  Anna stands her ground and insists on the letter of her contract, threatening to leave Siam, much to the dismay of wives and children.  The King orders her to obey as \"my servant\"; she repudiates the term and hurries away.  The King dismisses school, then leaves, uncertain of his next action. Meanwhile, Lun Tha comes upon Tuptim, and they muse about having to hide their relationship (\"We Kiss in a Shadow\").\n\nIn her room, Anna replays the confrontation in her mind, her anger building (\"Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?\").  Lady Thiang, the King's head wife, tells Anna that the King is troubled by his portrayal in the West as a barbarian, as the British are being urged to take over Siam as a protectorate .  Anna is shocked by the accusations \u2013 the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian \u2013 but she is reluctant to see him after their argument.  Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support (\"Something Wonderful\").  Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation.  The King tells her that the British are sending an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation.  Anna \"guesses\" \u2013 the only guise in which the King will accept advice \u2013 that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion.  Tuptim has been writing a play based on a book that Anna has lent her, Uncle Tom's Cabin , that can be presented to the guests.  News is brought to the King that the British are arriving much earlier than thought, and so Anna and the wives are to stay up all night to prepare.  The King assembles his family for a Buddhist prayer for the success of the venture and also promises before Buddha that Anna will receive her own house \"as provided in agreement, etc., etc.\"\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe wives are dressed in their new European-style gowns, which they find confining (\"Western People Funny\").  In the rush to prepare, the question of undergarments has been overlooked, and the wives have practically nothing on underneath their gowns. When the British envoy, Sir Edward Ramsay, arrives and gazes at them through a monocle, they are panicked by the \"evil eye\" and lift their skirts over their heads as they flee. Sir Edward is diplomatic about the incident. When the King is called away, it emerges that Sir Edward is an old flame of Anna's, and they dance in remembrance of old times, as Edward urges her to return to British society. The King returns and irritably reminds them that dancing is for after dinner.\n\nAs final preparations for the play are made, Tuptim steals a moment to meet with Lun Tha. He tells her he has an escape plan, and she should be ready to leave after the performance (\"I Have Dreamed\").  Anna encounters them, and they confide in her (\"Hello, Young Lovers\", reprise). The play (\" Small House of Uncle Thomas \", narrated ballet) is presented in a Siamese ballet-inspired dance. Tuptim is the narrator, and she tells her audience of the evil King Simon of Legree and his pursuit of the runaway slave Eliza . Eliza is saved by Buddha , who miraculously freezes a river and conceals her in snow. Buddha then causes the river to melt, drowning King Simon and his hunting party.  The anti-slavery message is blunt.\n\nAfter the play, Sir Edward reveals that the British threat has receded, but the King is distracted by his displeasure at Tuptim's rebellious message. After Sir Edward leaves, Anna and the King express their delight at how well the evening went, and he presents her with a ring.  Secret police report that Tuptim is missing.  The King realizes that Anna knows something; she parries his inquiry by asking why he should care, as Tuptim is just another woman to him. He is delighted; she is at last understanding the Siamese perspective. Anna tries to explain to him the Western customs of courtship and tells him what it is like for a young woman at a formal dance (\"Shall We Dance?\").  He demands that she teach him the dance. She does, and in that dance they experience and express a love for each other that they can never speak aloud. They are interrupted by the Kralahome. Tuptim has been captured, and a search is on for Lun Tha. The King resolves to punish Tuptim, though she denies she and Lun Tha were lovers. Anna tries to dissuade him, but he is determined that her influence shall not rule, and he takes the whip himself. He turns to lash Tuptim, but under Anna's gaze is unable to swing the whip, and hurries away. Lun Tha is found dead, and Tuptim is dragged off, swearing to kill herself; nothing more is heard about her.  Anna asks the Kralahome to give her ring back to the King; both schoolteacher and minister state their wish that she had never come to Siam.\n\nSeveral months pass with no contact between Anna and the King.  Anna is packed and ready to board a ship leaving Siam.  Chulalongkorn arrives with a letter from the King, who has been unable to resolve the conflicts within himself and is dying.  Anna hurries to the King's bedside and they reconcile.  The King persuades her to take back the ring and to stay and assist the next king, Chulalongkorn.  The dying man tells Anna to take dictation from the prince, and instructs the boy to give orders as if he were King.  The prince orders the end of the custom of kowtowing that Anna hated.  The King grudgingly accepts this decision.  As Chulalongkorn continues, prescribing a less arduous bow to show respect for the king, his father dies.  Anna kneels by the late King, holding his hand and kissing it, as the wives and children bow or curtsey, a gesture of respect to old king and new.",

Popular songs from the show included \" Wand'rin' Star \", \"I Talk to the Trees\", and \" They Call the Wind Maria \".\n\nThe musical ran on Broadway in 1951 and in the West End in 1953.

        "synopsis": "In the California Wilderness in May 1853, a crusty old miner, Ben Rumson, is conducting a makeshift funeral for a friend. Meanwhile, his 16-year-old daughter Jennifer discovers gold dust.  Ben claims the land, and prospectors start flocking to the brand new town of Rumson (\"I'm On My Way\").  Two months later Rumson has a population of 400, all of whom are men except for Jennifer.  Prospector Jake Whippany is waiting to save enough money to send for Cherry and her Fandango girls (\"Rumson\"), while Jennifer senses the tension building in town (\"What's Going On Here?\").  Julio Valveras, a handsome young miner forced to live and work outside of town because he is Mexican, comes to town with dirty laundry and runs into Jennifer, who volunteers to do his laundry.  They also talk to each other (\"I Talk to the Trees\").  Steve Bulmarck and the other men ponder the lonely nomadic life they lead in the song \"They Call the Wind Maria\".\n\nTwo months later the men want Ben to send Jennifer away, and he wishes her mother was still alive to help him (\"I Still See Elisa\").  Jennifer is in love with Julio (\"How Can I Wait?\"), and when Ben sees Jennifer dancing with Julio's clothes, he decides to send her East on the next stage.  Jacob Woodling, a Mormon man with two wives, Sarah and Elizabeth, arrives in Rumson where the men demand Jacob sell one of his wives.  To his surprise, Ben finds himself wooing Elizabeth (\"In Between\") and wins her for $800 (\"Whoop-Ti-Yay\").  Jennifer is disgusted by her father's actions and runs away, telling Julio that she will be reunited with him in a year's time (\"Cari\u00f1o M\u00edo\u201d). Cherry and her Fandango girls arrive (\"There's a Coach Comin' In\").  Julio learns his claim is running dry which means he has to move on to make a living and that he will not be there to greet Jennifer when she returns.\n\nA year later in October, the miners celebrate the high times in Rumson now that the Fandango girls are around (\"Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans\").  Edgar Crocker, a miner who has saved his money, falls for Elizabeth and she responds, although Ben does not notice since he thinks Raymond Janney is in love with her (he is).  Another miner, Mike Mooney, tells Julio about a lake that has gold dust on the bottom and he considers looking for it (\"Another Autumn\").  Jennifer returns in December, having learned civilized ways back East (\"All for Him\").  Ben tells his daughter that he will soon be moving on since he was not meant to stay in one place for long (\" Wand'rin' Star \").  The next day as Cherry and the girls are packing to leave they tell her about Julio leaving to find the lake with a bottom of gold.  Raymond Janney offers to buy Elizabeth from Ben for $3,000, but she runs off with Edgar Crocker.\n\nWord comes of another strike 40 miles south of Rumson and the rest of the town packs up to leave except for Jennifer, who is waiting for Julio to return, and Ben, who suddenly realizes that Rumson is indeed his town.  Late in April, Julio appears, a broken man.  Ben welcomes him and Julio is amazed to see Jennifer is there.  As they move toward each other, the wagons filled with people move on.",

        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nThe recently orphaned Patrick Dennis and his nanny, Agnes Gooch, arrive in Manhattan. Patrick has been placed under the care of his aunt, the eccentric Mame Dennis, with Dwight Babcock as his trustee. The two head to Mame\u2019s residence (\u201cSt. Bridget\u201d), where a party is in full swing (\u201cIt\u2019s Today\u201d). Mame introduces Patrick to her collection of kooky friends, such as Vera Charles, a baritone actress and the First Lady of the American Theatre; Ralph Divine, the runner of a progressive school called \u201cThe Laboratory of Life\u201d; and M. Lindsay Woolsey, a book publisher.\n\nTwo weeks pass, and Babcock arrives to discuss Patrick\u2019s schooling. Mame wishes for Patrick to go to a co-educational liberal arts school, while Babcock demands that he go to a conservative school. However, Mame decides to instead enroll Patrick into The Laboratory of Life and take him on adventures without Babcock\u2019s knowledge (\u201cOpen a New Window\u201d).\n\nMame and Patrick\u2019s escapades are cut short by Babcock, who has discovered Mame\u2019s deceit and angrily takes Patrick off to boarding school, devastating Mame. To make matters worse, Mame loses her fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929 . Vera proposes Mame join her in a new operetta. However, the operetta goes disastrously, with Mame showing up on stage late and falling during her moment (\u201cThe Moon Song\u201d (The Man in the Moon)). Mame is fired from the theatre, but Patrick arrives and comforts her (\u201cMy Best Girl\u201d).\n\nMame gets a new job at a hairdressers and there she meets Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside. While giving him a manicure, she gets flustered and causes him to bleed. She\u2019s fired once more, despite Beau\u2019s protests, and returns to her residence, where Patrick is staying for three days. To lighten the mood, Mame reveals presents she bought for Patrick, Ito, and Agnes, declaring \u201c We Need a Little Christmas \u201d. The four celebrate as Beau enters and offers to take Mame, and the other three, to dinner. Mame accepts and the five of them exit merrily.\n\nBeau takes Mame and Patrick to his family home in Georgia, to the ire of Beau\u2019s family, especially Sally Cato. Sally calls for a hunt and makes an attempt on Mame\u2019s life by giving her a mad horse. To everyone\u2019s shock, Mame returns with the fox alive (\u201cThe Fox Hunt\u201d). Beau proposes to Mame, she accepts, and everyone sings Mame\u2019s praises (\u201c Mame \u201d). Patrick, Beau, and Mame embrace (\u201cFinale Act 1\u201d).\n\n### Act 2\n\nPatrick, as he grows up, writes several letters to the now married Mame, and she writes back (\u201cOpening Act Two\u201d (The Letter)). When Mame discovers that Patrick\u2019s roommate is Babcock\u2019s son, she insists to Beau that she must return to Patrick. Mame and Beau\u2019s honeymoon is cut short with Beau\u2019s sudden death. Once again, Patrick comforts Mame (\u201cMy Best Girl\u201d (Reprise)).\n\nVera, Patrick, and Lindsay decide that Mame should write a book on her life, with Agnes as her secretary, which Mame agrees to. Vera and Mame catch up, declaring each other \u201cBosom Buddies\u201d. Mame and Vera learn that Agnes is so repressed that she has never dated before and can\u2019t say the word \u201csex\u201d. Mame declares to Agnes \u201cLife\u2019s a banquet and most poor sons of bitches are starving to death.\u201d Vera and Mame glam the now excited Agnes up and send her out into the world.\n\nSix months pass, and Patrick reveals that he has a fianc\u00e9e, Gloria Upson. Agnes returns pregnant and recounts her adventures (\u201cGooch\u2019s Song\u201d). Mame allows Agnes to stay with her as Patrick invites Mame to go see the Upsons in Connecticut .\n\nMame arrives at the Upsons estate, or as they call it \u201cUpsons Down\u201d, where Babcock is also visiting. Mame is introduced to the boorish and bigoted Upsons, as well as Junior Babcock. The Upsons and the older Babcock leave momentarily and Mame dances with the party guests (\u201cThat\u2019s How Young I Feel\u201d). The Upsons reveal to Mame their plans for a wedding gift to Patrick and Gloria: an empty plot of land next to the Upson\u2019s estate, hoping that \u201cthe wrong people\u201d don\u2019t move in. Mame conceals her disapproval and speaks to Patrick in private and begs him to reconsider. Patrick leaves in a huff and Mame questions where she went wrong in raising him (\u201cIf He Walked Into My Life\u201d).\n\nMame convinces Patrick to invite the Upsons to her newly renovated apartment. Patrick meets the designer, Pegeen Ryan, another student of The Laboratory of Life. The Upsons arrive and Mame introduces them to her cooky friends and lifestyle (\u201cIt\u2019s Today\u201d (Reprise)). Mame reveals that she bought the plot of land to make a home for single mothers. The Upsons storm out and Gloria dumps Patrick. Mame declares that all this was for Patrick, who thanks her (\u201cMy Best Girl\u201d (Reprise)).\n\nYears pass, Pegeen and Patrick are now married and have a son, Peter. Mame plans to take Peter to India , to the disapproval of his parents. Peter recites Mame\u2019s mantra, which convinces Pegeen and Patrick to allow Peter to go with Mame.

        "synopsis": "On the last day of school, the students of East High look forward to summer vacation (\" What Time Is It? \"). Wildcats captain Troy Bolton, still dating Gabriella Montez following their lead roles in the school's winter musical, is desperately looking for a summer job to help pay for college.\n\nSharpay Evans, still bitter about the musical's outcome and hoping to get Troy for herself, directs Mr. Fulton, the manager of her family's country club Lava Springs, to hire him. Troy accepts on the condition that the club hires Gabriella and their other friends as well. Sharpay's enjoyment of the country club (\" Fabulous \") is cut short upon learning that Gabriella is working as one of the lifeguards. Unable to get her fired, she orders Fulton to drive the Wildcats out by making the work miserable. Troy rebuilds their confidence and convinces them that they can persevere (\"Work This Out\"), despite Chad's initial objections. Later that day, Troy and Gabriella picnic on the golf course. A jealous Sharpay has the sprinklers turned on, but fails to ruin their romantic moment.\n\nTroy and Gabriella's composer friend Kelsi Nielsen writes a song called \" You Are the Music in Me \" for them to sing at the club's upcoming talent show. Sharpay, hoping to get Troy to sing with her, arranges for him to be her father's caddy and eat dinner with their family, forcing him to be late to a date with Gabriella. Troy feels uncomfortable about being served by his friends, but his father and basketball coach advises him to make the most of the opportunities he's being given, as they may lead to an athletic scholarship .\n\nTroy is further promoted, granted access to the club's facilities, and given the chance to play with the University of Albuquerque basketball team, and reluctantly accepts Sharpay's invitation to sing in the talent show. Gabriella's best friend Taylor warns her that Troy may not be able to resist the temptation of his dream future. Meanwhile, Sharpay's brother and singing partner Ryan becomes upset when Sharpay cuts him out of the act, and Gabriella invites him to a staff baseball game, where he persuades the Wildcats to take part in the talent show (\" I Don't Dance \").\n\nMeanwhile, Sharpay forces Kelsi to re-arrange \"You Are the Music in Me\" into an up-tempo number which she and Troy rehearse. Seeing the staff members rehearse their number, she orders Fulton to ban all junior staff members from the talent show. Gabriella confronts Sharpay about her manipulation, quits, and leaves Troy (\" Gotta Go My Own Way \").\n\nThe other Wildcats are furious with Troy for his callous treatment and he resolves to make things right (\" Bet on It \"). Troy gets his old job back, barring him from singing in the talent show unless Sharpay lifts the restriction, which she reluctantly does. Ryan gives Troy a new song to learn moments before the show, \" Everyday \" which he sings with Gabriella as the Wildcats join them onstage. Sharpay presents Ryan with the award for the talent show. The Wildcats go to the golf course to enjoy the fireworks (\"You Are the Music In Me (Reprise)\"), Troy and Gabriella finally successfully kiss, and everyone at Lava Springs celebrates the end of summer with a pool party the next day (\"All for One\").",

The musical was co-produced by the University of Arts Berlin and the Neuk\u00f6lln Opera. The issue of emancipation is told from the perspective of three young women in contemporary Berlin and by the three Bront\u00eb sisters living in Victorian England .",
        "synopsis": "The musical parallels the restricted lives of the Bront\u00eb sisters with those of three women in 2010s Berlin. The 18-year-old Berlin pupils, Milly and Aydin, are close to graduating from high school . However the two young women do not seem to have anything else in common: Milly tries to enjoy life to the fullest, and the visit of techno parties, the use of designer drugs and noncommittal sex are an expression of her personal freedom and her seemingly self-determined life. Aydin, meanwhile, fears not being able to leave high school, and there is an arranged marriage with her cousin from Bursa on the horizon, a man whom she does not know. While Aydin wants to make her own decisions about her life, she believes her father is more likely to find a good man than if she were to seek offers on her own. The two very different settings of the two students repeatedly provoke violent arguments and criticism of each other's way of life, conversations their teacher, Lotte Birkner, does not tolerate in the classroom, because she is annoyed by feminist debates. She tries to focus the interest of the pupils on the lesson: the literary work of the three Bront\u00eb sisters .\n\nThe novels and letters left by the Victorian-era English pastor's daughters Charlotte, Anne and Emily Bront\u00eb make them pioneers of emancipation. Cut off from the rest of the world, they write about the limited role of women prescribed by civil society and their visions of how it could be better. To be accepted by publishers, the Bront\u00eb sisters have to give themselves male pseudonyms. After their release the books are hotly debated by the British public, because of the progressive representation of women's fates, and also their own brother Branwell, who tried himself as a writer as well, is shocked when he recognizes the ambitious attempts of his sisters.\n\nReading the Bront\u00ebs' works, the pupils and their teacher realise that what the Bront\u00eb sisters have left in their novels and letters, although set in the Victorian era, is quite sudden surprisingly contemporary, and they identify themselves increasingly with the sisters. The young women and the three dead writers become \"sisters in spirit\".\n\nUltimately, the Bront\u00ebs die young, but leave world literature that must be seen as a milestone of emancipation. Addicted to opium and alcohol , and full of despair about his own lack of genius, the brother dies first of tuberculosis . Shortly thereafter Emily follows, and the second-youngest sister Anne a year later. After the death of all of her siblings, Charlotte Bront\u00eb gives up the utopia of freedom and self-determination and marries the staid curate Arthur Nicholls, who urges her to stop writing. Even in today's Berlin, in terms of emancipation the story ends rather with a set of knowledge gains than with a \"happy ending\".",

He has eloped from Paris with a schoolgirl, Elphin Haye, who is an American heiress masquerading as a penniless orphan. They arrive at the inn, preceded by four people who are in pursuit of them. A. Bunker Bliss is after Dick for eloping with his niece, and, being a good republican, Bliss is not impressed by Dick's earldom. Mrs. Shimmering Black is after Dick because the Earl of Hole has jilted her daughter (in fact it is Boodel who has done so). Mr. Talk and Mr. Downham are both lawyers; the first is English and the second American. They are both in search of the missing heir and after the reward for finding him. Dick is unaware that these two are bearing him good news, and when he learns from the landlord that some strangers have been asking about him, he concludes that there is trouble brewing.\n\nDick persuades Jim Cheese to exchange identities with him, taking his name and even his girlfriend, and entrusting Elphin to Jim's care. The American lawyer finds Jim and tells him that he is an earl, and advances him money on the strength of his title. Elphir runs across a friend, Daisy Fallowfield, at the inn, and the whole party go off to the ball, where Elphir has to introduce Jim to her aunt, Miss Virginia Bliss, as her fianc\u00e9.\n\nAll the characters turn up at the ball at Hole Hall. Boodel brings Dick and passes him off as another guest. Liza slips in after Jim, who is announced as the Earl of Hole. The four pursuers gatecrash the party. Jim has a rough time with Bunker Bliss and Mrs. Black when they find him \u2013 the former is intent on shooting him, and the latter, a circus strongwoman, is a terrifying prospect \u2013 but when he tells them the truth about who is who, everyone is satisfied.  Mrs Black's wrath subsides when she realises that the man who jilted her daughter is not, in fact, an earl, Bunker Bliss is appeased, and all ends happily.",

        "title": "Swing Time (film)",
        "description": "Swing Time is a 1936 American musical comedy film , the sixth of ten starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers . Directed by George Stevens for RKO , it features Helen Broderick , Victor Moore , Betty Furness , Eric Blore and Georges Metaxa , with music by Jerome Kern and lyrics by Dorothy Fields . Set mainly in New York City , the film follows a gambler and dancer, \"Lucky\" (Astaire), who is trying to raise money to secure his marriage when he meets a dance instructor, Penny (Rogers), and begins dancing with her; the two soon fall in love and are forced to reconcile their feelings.\n\nNoted dance critic Arlene Croce considers Swing Time to be Astaire and Rogers's best dance musical, a view shared by John Mueller and Hannah Hyam. It features four dance routines that are each regarded as masterpieces. According to The Oxford Companion to the American Musical , Swing Time is \"a strong candidate for the best of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals\". The Oxford Companion says that, although the screenplay is contrived, it \"left plenty of room for dance and all of it was superb. ... Although the movie is remembered as one of the great dance musicals, it also boasts one of the best film scores of the 1930s.\" \"Never Gonna Dance\" is often singled out as the partnership's and collaborator Hermes Pan 's most profound achievement in filmed dance, while \" The Way You Look Tonight \" won the Academy Award for Best Original Song , and Astaire topped the U.S. pop chart with it in 1936. Jerome Kern's score, the first of two that he composed specially for Astaire films, contains three of his most memorable songs.\n\nThe film's plot has been criticized, though, as has the performance of Metaxa. More praised is Rogers's acting and dancing performance. Rogers credited much of the film's success to Stevens: \"He gave us a certain quality, I think, that made it stand out above the others.\" Swing Time also marked the beginning of a decline in popularity of the Astaire\u2013Rogers partnership among the general public, with box-office receipts falling faster than usual after a successful opening. Nevertheless, the film was a sizable hit, costing $886,000, grossing over $2,600,000 worldwide, and showing a net profit of $830,000. The partnership never regained the creative heights scaled in this and previous films.\n\nIn 1999, Swing Time was listed as one of Entertainment Weekly 's top 100 films. In 2004, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) , it is ranked at No. 90.",
        "synopsis": "John \"Lucky\" Garnett is a gambler and dancer who is ready to marry Margaret Watson. Not wanting him to retire, the other members of his dance act deliberately sabotage the event. \"Pop\" Cardetti takes Lucky's trousers to be altered by sewing cuffs, while the others begin a crap game. After the tailor refuses to modify the pants, Pop returns with them, unaltered. Margaret's father phones to say that he has sent everyone home, but the call is intercepted. When Lucky finally leaves for the wedding, his troupe bets the bankroll that he will not get married. Lucky mollifies Margaret's father by saying that he was \"earning\" $200. Judge Watson tells Lucky that he must earn $25,000 to demonstrate his good intentions.\n\nAt the train station, Lucky's dance troupe takes all of his money, except for his lucky quarter because he did not get married. Pop and Lucky board the first freight train to New York. Lucky meets Penny when he asks for change for his lucky quarter, so that he can buy cigarettes for Pop. The cigarette machine dumps a load of coins, so they follow Penny and offer to repurchase the quarter, but she is in no mood to deal with them. Pop sneaks the quarter out of her purse when she drops her things, but she thinks that Lucky did it. Lucky insists on following Penny to her job as a dance school instructor. He accepts a dancing lesson from her agency to apologize. After a disastrous lesson (\"Pick Yourself Up\"), Penny tells him to \"save his money\". Her boss, Mr. Gordon, overhears and fires her. He also fires Mabel Anderson for complaining that Pop ate her sandwich. Lucky dances with Penny to prove how much that she has taught him. Gordon gives Penny back her job, and sets up an audition with the owner of the Silver Sandal nightclub.\n\nLucky and Pop check into the hotel where Penny and Mabel live. Lucky fails to win a tuxedo for the audition by playing strip piquet . They miss the audition, and Penny gets mad at Lucky again. He and Pop picket in front of Penny's apartment door for a week. Mabel intervenes, and Penny forgives him, agreeing to a second audition. At the Silver Sandal, bandleader Ricardo Romero, who wants to marry Penny, refuses to play for them. The club owner cannot force him because he lost Romero's contract in a bet with Club Raymond. At the casino, Pop warns Lucky that he is about to win enough money to marry Margaret. He takes his bet off the table. The club owner wagers Ricardo's contract on a cut of the cards. Seeing that Raymond intends to cheat, Pop cheats too, and Lucky wins the contract.\n\nLucky and Penny are dance partners, but he avoids seeing her alone. He lacks the nerve to tell her about Margaret. Mabel arranges a trip to the country. Lucky resists the temptation to snuggle in a snow-covered gazebo, prompting \"A Fine Romance\". Pop lets the truth slip about Margaret. In the remodeled Silver Sandal, Penny refuses another proposal from Ricardo. Mabel dares her to give Lucky \"a great big kiss\". They do kiss behind a dressing room door. Pop lets his sleight of hand become known to Raymond, who insists on competing with Lucky for the contract. He loses. Margaret arrives, and Lucky asks her to meet him the next day. While Lucky is indecisive, Penny becomes heartbroken. Lucky finds her in the deserted club, where he learns that she has agreed to marry Ricardo. Asked about the future, he sings \"Never Gonna Dance\", segueing without dialogue into their dance to \"The Way You Look Tonight\".\n\nThe next day, Margaret tells Lucky that she wants to marry someone else. Everyone laughs until Pop announces that Ricardo and Penny will be married that afternoon. They rush to intervene and manage to pull off the trouser gag. While waiting for the nonexistent alteration, Ricardo struggles to keep up a pair of baggy pants. An infectious round of laughter causes Penny to call off the wedding, having been wooed by Lucky.",

Jones's manuscript was heavily censored by his publisher to remove profanity and references to gay prostitution; the unexpurgated version was not published until 2011.

The West End production stars Darius Campbell as Warden, Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt, and Ryan Sampson as Maggio.

The musical consists of March of the Falsettos (1981) and Falsettoland (1990), the last two installments in a trio of one-act musicals that premiered off-Broadway (the first was In Trousers ). The story centers on Marvin, who has left his wife to be with a male lover, Whizzer, and struggles to keep his family together. Much of the first act explores the impact his relationship with Whizzer has had on his family. The second act explores family dynamics that evolve as he and his ex-wife plan his son's bar mitzvah , which is complicated as Whizzer comes down with an early case of AIDS. Central to the musical are the themes of Jewish identity, gender roles, and gay life in the late 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nFalsettos premiered on Broadway in 1992 and was nominated for seven Tony Awards , winning those for Best Book and Best Original Score . The musical was revived on Broadway in 2016 starring Christian Borle , Stephanie J. Block , Andrew Rannells , Anthony Rosenthal, and Brandon Uranowitz. The 2016 revival was filmed and adapted for the PBS Live from Lincoln Center television series, and aired on October 27, 2017. The revival was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical . Both the original cast and 2016 revival cast performed at the Tony Awards. Other revivals include tours in Australia and the United Kingdom. The musical was praised by critics for its melodic compositions, humor, character development, and positive portrayal of non-traditional family structures.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I: March of the Falsettos\n\nIn 1979 in New York City , Marvin, his ten-year-old son Jason, his psychiatrist Mendel, and his lover Whizzer are in the midst of an argument (\"Four Jews in a Room Bitching\"). Marvin explains the situation: he has left his wife Trina for a man, Whizzer, but no one is happy with his attempts to integrate Whizzer into the family (\"A Tight-Knit Family\"). At Marvin's suggestion, Trina visits Mendel and explains she is having trouble accepting the end of her marriage and her failure to be a perfect wife. Mendel, instantly attracted to her, tries to reassure her that she is not to blame (\"Love Is Blind\"). Marvin and Whizzer note that they have very little in common but are intensely attracted to each other and worry that their feelings for one another are fading (\"The Thrill of First Love\"). In a series of therapy sessions with Mendel, Marvin discusses his relationship with Whizzer, his failed relationship with Trina (with Mendel pressing him for intimate details about her), and his inability to connect with his son (\"Marvin at the Psychiatrist - A Three-Part Mini-Opera\"). Jason is worried that he will turn out to be gay like his father (\"My Father's a Homo\"). His parents suggest he see Mendel to deal with his mood swings. Jason refuses to listen to his parents but agrees to go to therapy once Whizzer also recommends it (\"Everyone Tells Jason to See a Psychiatrist\").\n\nMarvin and Whizzer fight over Whizzer's disdain for monogamy and Marvin's attempt to force him into the role of a housewife (\"This Had Better Come to a Stop\"). Trina is concerned that Whizzer is taking her place in the family and has a mental breakdown (\"I'm Breaking Down\"). Trina requests that Mendel provide in-home therapy for Jason (\"Please Come to Our House\"). Mendel gets to know Trina and Jason through these sessions (\"Jason's Therapy\"). Mendel clumsily proposes to Trina (\"A Marriage Proposal\"). She accepts, sparking jealousy in Marvin (\"A Tight-Knit Family - Reprise\"). Trina is frustrated with the male-dominated world she lives in and the immaturity of the men around her (\"Trina's Song\"). The four sing a hymn to masculinity, the three adults singing in falsetto to match Jason's unbroken voice (\"March of the Falsettos\"). Trina collects herself and calms down from her frustration (\"Trina's Song - Reprise\").\n\nMarvin tries to teach Whizzer how to play chess , but both of their bitterness boils over, causing them to fight and break up (\"The Chess Game\"). Meanwhile, Trina and Mendel move in together (\"Making a Home\"). As he packs his things to leave, Whizzer reflects on his life and relationship with Marvin. He has been used by other men his whole life, and finally decides that he doesn't want to live like that anymore (\"The Games I Play\"). After receiving Mendel and Trina's marriage announcement, Marvin breaks down in rage and slaps Trina (\"Marvin Hits Trina\"). Shocked by his actions, everyone confesses that they never intended to feel so deeply about the people in their lives, and they accept the pain that love can bring (\"I Never Wanted to Love You\"). Jason discovers his attraction to girls, to his relief. In the wake of the destruction of his relationships with both Whizzer and Trina, Marvin sits Jason down for a talk. Marvin tells Jason that no matter what kind of man Jason turns out to be, Marvin will always be there for him, ending the act with the two in a warm embrace (\"Father to Son\").\n\n### Act II: Falsettoland\n\nIt is 1981, two years later. Two new characters are introduced: Marvin's lesbian neighbors Dr. Charlotte, an internist , and Cordelia, a gentile caterer specializing in Jewish cuisine . Marvin has not seen Whizzer for two years and has not gotten over him (\"Falsettoland\"). Marvin observes that it's time for him to grow up and get over himself (\"About Time\"). He has managed to maintain his relationship with Jason and now shares split custody of him with Trina, who has married Mendel. Marvin and Trina begin planning Jason's bar mitzvah , and each character has a different opinion regarding how it should be celebrated (\"Year of the Child\"). Later, at Jason's Little League Baseball game, Jason ponders which girls he will invite to the bar mitzvah (\"Miracle of Judaism\"). Whizzer arrives at the baseball game after being invited by Jason. Marvin cautiously asks Whizzer on a date just as Jason manages to hit the ball (\"The Baseball Game\"). An interlude ends with everyone reflecting on how wonderful life is (\"A Day in Falsettoland\"). Soon afterwards, Marvin and Trina argue at length about the logistics of the bar mitzvah (\"The Fight\"). Jason wants to call it off because of all the arguing, and Mendel consoles him, telling him that hating his parents is normal for his age, but everyone eventually matures (\"Everyone Hates His Parents\").\n\nLater, Marvin sits in bed looking at a sleeping Whizzer, and wonders at how much he loves him (\"What More Can I Say?\"). Dr. Charlotte, meanwhile, is becoming aware that young gay men in the city are arriving at the hospital sick with a mysterious illness that no one understands (\"Something Bad Is Happening\"). Whizzer collapses suddenly during a game of racquetball and is hospitalized (\"More Racquetball\"). Trina is disturbed to realize how upset she is at his condition (\"Holding to the Ground\"). In Whizzer's hospital room, everyone gathers to cheer him up, commenting on how well he looks. They agree that it is days like this that make them believe in God , but Jason is honest and tells Whizzer that he looks awful (\"Days Like This\"). Jason wants to wait for Whizzer to get well before holding his bar mitzvah, but Mendel and Trina sit him down to inform him that Whizzer may not recover (\"Canceling the Bar Mitzvah\"). Marvin sits in Whizzer's hospital room and is joined by Cordelia and Dr. Charlotte, and the four reaffirm their commitment to each other despite Whizzer's worsening situation (\"Unlikely Lovers\").\n\nAs Whizzer's condition deteriorates, Jason turns to God, offering to get bar mitzvah-ed in exchange for Whizzer getting better (\"Another Miracle of Judaism\"). Dr. Charlotte explains more about the illness to Marvin and implies that Marvin may become sick as well (\"Something Bad Is Happening - Reprise\"). Whizzer's illness becomes terminal , and he resolves to face death with dignity and courage (\"You Gotta Die Sometime\"). Everyone bursts into the room; Jason has decided he wants to hold the ceremony in Whizzer's hospital room (\"Jason's Bar Mitzvah\"). As Jason completes his recitation, Whizzer collapses and is taken from the room, followed by everyone but Marvin. Marvin, left alone, asks the departed Whizzer what his life would be if they had not loved each other. Whizzer's spirit appears, asking if Marvin regrets their relationship, and Marvin states he would do it all again (\"What Would I Do?\"). Marvin's friends and family surround him, and he breaks down in their arms. Mendel steps forward, declaring: \"This is where we take a stand\" (\"Falsettoland - Reprise\").",

When Althea's older brother is killed, her father tells her she must prepare to be queen, but she laughs and refuses, leading to a disheartened Lagobel army being slaughtered in battle with Sealand troops. Althea's father tries various cruel cures to find her gravity, and tries to force her into an arranged marriage so she can provide a child to be a more suitable future monarch, but she escapes and flees to the wilderness that separates Lagobel and Sealand. There she meets Sealand's prince, Digby, who has been unable to smile since the death of his mother. The two fall in love and conceive a child, but soon fight as Digby wants a more traditional life in a house, while Althea wants to live in the lake forever. Digby returns home, where his cruel father dams the lake in order to cut off Lagobel's water supply and kill all the people. Digby runs away from his own arranged marriage and breaks down the dam, but is nearly killed in the process, causing Althea to cry and therefore regain her gravity. The two get married and live happily ever after, Althea becoming a marine biologist and leaving the running of the country to her female prime minister.\n\nAdamson and Amos' story version was released in a paperback edition including the full script and lyrics.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIt is 1926, the Jazz Age and the era of Prohibition .  Jimmy Winter is very popular among the young ladies, and they are cleaning the living room of his Long Island , New York , estate, declaring that \"The Woman's Touch\" is exactly what his home needs.  Jimmy has been away but is coming home that evening.  In his absence, some English bootleggers , the Duke of Durham, his sister, Lady Kay, and their thick-headed American assistants, \"Shorty\" McGee and Larry Potter, have stashed their illegal booze in Jimmy's house.  When they hear that Jimmy is returning, the Duke cancels that night's rum run and plans to remove their hundreds of cases of liquor from the cellar.  Dolly and Phyllis Ruxton, two of the young ladies, happen to be identical twins.  They join Larry in an extemporaneous song and dance (\"Don't Ask\").\n\nRevenue Officer Jansen arrives, convinced that a crime is in progress, but departs when Jimmy returns home.  Jimmy is accompanied by his serious and overbearing second wife, Constance, to whom he has just been married.  His first marriage followed a drunken college prank, and the couple has now been separated for many years.  He applied for an annulment so he could marry Constance.  Shorty passes himself off as the new butler, having sent away the butler and maid that Jimmy had ordered.  As butler, Shorty can make sure the rum in the basement is safe.\n\nJimmy receives a telegram from his lawyer saying that the annulment has not been completed, so Jimmy and Constance are illegally married.  Constance furiously leaves for the nearest inn.  Jimmy tells Shorty about a beautiful girl who saved him from drowning last summer.  He is interrupted when the young ladies who cleaned his house return to welcome him home.  He declares that each is a \"Dear Little Girl\".  They leave, and Jimmy prepares for bed as a storm rages outside.  Lady Kay, clad in oilskin and clutching a revolver, enters pursued by revenue officers.  She turns out to be the girl who rescued Jimmy the previous summer.  Jimmy hides her in his bedroom when Officer Jansen arrives at the house to question Jimmy.  Jansen leaves but then returns and sees Kay and Jimmy together.  Kay says she is Jimmy's wife, and since the just-married suitcases are still scattered around the living room, the revenue officer believes her and leaves.  Kay cannot go out in the terrible storm, so she will have to stay the night in Jimmy's room (\"Maybe\").\n\nThe Duke and Larry arrive at Jimmy's house the next morning searching frantically for Kay.  The pretty girls also drop in, and Larry leads a minstrel-style song and dance (\" Clap Yo' Hands \") to cheer up the Duke.  Kay hides in Jimmy's bedroom until all the guests leave.  The revenue officer returns, and Jimmy and Kay pretend to be newlyweds (\"Do, Do, Do\").  The Duke, Constance and Constance's father, Judge Appleton, all show up, and Kay hides in the bedroom again.  Now that Jimmy's annulment is final, the Judge plans to preside over an official marriage ceremony that afternoon.  Constance hears noises from the bedroom and opens the door.  Kay, now dressed as an English maid, introduces herself as Jane, wife of Shorty the butler.  Kay realizes she is in love with Jimmy and resolves to prevent his marriage to Constance.\n\n### Act II\n\nWedding photographs of the \"Bride and Groom\" are being taken, and Kay, still disguised as a maid, tries to convince Jimmy that she would be a better wife than fussy Constance.  She tells her rag doll that she needs \" Someone to Watch Over Me \".  Larry is supposed to be ferrying the booze out of the cellar, but he ends up demonstrating the dancing ability of his \"Fidgety Feet\" instead.  The revenue officer shows up briefly and is confused when Kay is introduced as Shorty's wife, not Jimmy's wife.  The Judge and Constance demand lunch, and Shorty and Kay must serve them.  The meal becomes increasingly chaotic, and the Judge and Constance are severely offended and leave.  Jimmy declares that spending time with the lovely ladies who frequent his house is \"Heaven on Earth\".\n\nThe revenue officer returns and is shocked to hear that Jimmy is getting married that afternoon, since he saw him with his wife the previous night.  Kay is trying on one of Constance's gowns, and, since she does not look like a maid anymore, she and Shorty convince the revenue officer that she is Jimmy's wife.  She just looks like Jane the maid; Dolly and Phyllis demonstrate that two people can look alike.\n\nKay and Shorty plot to stop the wedding.  When Jimmy sees Kay in Constance's dress, she is so beautiful that he kisses her.  The wedding begins, and as the Judge reads the service, he is interrupted by Shorty, disguised as a revenue agent, who is executing Kay's plan.  He says that Jimmy is under arrest for hiding alcohol in his house.  The real revenue officer arrives, arrests the Duke and Kay, and charges Jimmy with harboring a criminal.  He reveals that he found Kay in Jimmy's pajamas the night before masquerading as Jimmy's wife.  The bootleggers and Jimmy are placed under arrest and locked in the cellar as the booze is trucked away.  They soon discover, however, that the basement has been left unlocked, and they can leave.\n\nThat night, Jimmy gives a party for his friends and the bootleggers.  His friends all praise Kay, declaring \"Oh, Kay, You're OK with Me\".  The revenue officer arrives and confesses that he is really the Blackbird, a famous pirate, and he has just stolen all their liquor!  But it turns out that the truck drivers were working for Shorty and Larry.  Blackbird swears that he will have his revenge.  Since he thinks Kay does not have a United States visa , he wants her deported.  However, Jimmy arrives with their new marriage license, proving that Kay is a U.S. citizen .",

The sequel to High School Musical 2 (2007) and the third and final installment of the High School Musical film series , the film follows Troy Bolton ( Zac Efron ), Gabriella Montez ( Vanessa Hudgens ), Sharpay Evans ( Ashley Tisdale ), her twin brother Ryan Evans ( Lucas Grabeel ), Chad Danforth ( Corbin Bleu ), and Taylor McKessie ( Monique Coleman ), who are in their final year of high school and face the daunting prospect of being separated as they go off to college. Joined by the rest of their East High classmates, they stage their last spring musical, reflecting their experiences, hopes, and fears about the future.\n\nHigh School Musical 3: Senior Year was developed immediately following the success of its predecessor. Production returned to Utah for which Disney received a $2 million tax-break incentive, the largest the state has ever given to a film. Principal photography began in May 2008, and Walt Disney Pictures diverted a larger production and marketing budget to accommodate a theatrical release. The production returned to previous filming locations East High School and Murray High School , while additional scenes were filmed in Los Angeles .\n\nAn early airing of the film High School Musical 3: Senior Year took place on channel Jetix Eastern Europe (Russia/CIS, Romania, and Bulgaria) on July 14, 2008. High School Musical 3: Senior Year premiered in London on October 17, 2008, and was theatrically released in the United States on October 24, making it the only theatrical release in the franchise. Upon release, the film proved to be a moderate critical success, with some critics noting it as an improvement over the previous two installments due to the more emotional tone and themes, while many praised the higher production values. The film was also a commercial success, as it grossed $90.5 million worldwide in its first three days of release, setting a new record for the largest opening weekend for a musical film. Overall, the film grossed $252.9 million worldwide. The film's soundtrack was also successful, debuting and peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 in the United States. A spin-off film, Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure (2011), was released direct-to-video and on television.",
        "synopsis": "East High's Wildcats basketball team compete against their long-time rival, the West High Knights, in the final game of the season. At the half, East High is severely losing. However, Troy rallies his teammates and wins the game (\"Now or Never\"). During the team's celebratory party, Troy and Gabriella discuss their unknown future and the short time they have left at East High. (\"Right Here, Right Now\")\n\nThe next day, at school, Ms. Darbus notices the lack of students signing up for the musical, and Sharpay suggests a one-woman show. Kelsi signs up everyone in homeroom , much to the class' dismay. Ms. Darbus announces that the show will be called \"Senior Year\", focusing on the future of the graduating seniors, and reveals that Sharpay, Ryan, Kelsi, and Troy have all been considered for a scholarship at Juilliard , but only one will be chosen. Sharpay becomes desperate to win and, knowing that Kelsi will give the best songs to Troy and Gabriella, gets Ryan to try to persuade Kelsi to give them a song by predicting her and Ryan's future (\"I Want It All\"). Sharpay later befriends Tiara Gold, a British transfer student, and they begin working together. However, everyone begins to suspect Tiara might be using Sharpay for her own personal gain, with Ryan, Taylor, Chad, and the others attempting to warn her. However, Sharpay refuses to believe it.\n\nWhile on the rooftop, Troy asks Gabriella to prom and she teaches him how to dance (\"Can I Have This Dance?\"), while Taylor refuses Chad's pathetic attempt to ask her to the dance. She later relents when Chad asks again in front of the other students during lunch. The group rehearses for the musical with a scene about their prom night (\"A Night to Remember\"). The next day, Ryan and Kelsi rehearse (\"Just Wanna Be With You\"), which leads to Ryan asking Kelsi to prom, while Troy and Chad reminisce about their past in Reilly's Auto Parts (\"The Boys are Back\"). Tiara learns Gabriella has been accepted into the Stanford Freshman's Honors Program and informs Sharpay, who, in turn, informs Troy and convinces him that he is the only thing keeping Gabriella from going. Troy convinces Gabriella to go, and she leaves for college the next day (\"Walk Away\").\n\nTroy and his father, Jack, argue about which college he will attend, and Troy drives to East High conflicted until he finally screams in anger in the theater (\"Scream\"). Witnessing this, Ms. Darbus reveals that she sent in his application for Juilliard. Troy gets a call from Gabriella saying that although she loves him, she will not return for prom nor graduation. However, on the day of the prom, Troy visits Gabriella at Stanford and they have their own dance (\"Can I Have This Dance? (Reprise)\"). Meanwhile, Sharpay prepares for the musical at East High, and Troy texts his teammate Jimmie \"Rocket Man\" Zara to be his understudy because he is going to be late to the show.\n\nKelsi and Ryan start the show (\"Senior Year Spring Musical\"). As Troy and Gabriella's understudy, Jimmie performs with Sharpay and embarrasses her, although the audience applauds. Troy and Gabriella appear during the second half of the show and sing their duet together. Tiara betrays Sharpay, telling her she will take over the drama department in the next semester. Humiliated, Sharpay ultimately joins Tiara's performance and upstages her as payback.\n\nAt the end of the musical, Ms. Darbus reveals that both Kelsi and Ryan have won the Juilliard scholarship, and Troy reveals he has chosen to attend the University of California, Berkeley to be close to Gabriella, play basketball, and perform in theater. Taylor reveals that she will be attending Yale University with honors to study political science, and Sharpay and Chad reveal they will attend the University of Albuquerque for performing arts and basketball, respectively (\"We're All In This Together (Graduation Mix)\"). At the graduation ceremony, Troy gives the class speech after being selected by Ms. Darbus, and everyone celebrates (\"High School Musical\"). The six leads walk toward the stage and take their final bows as the curtain closes.",

        "description": "My Fair Lady is a musical with a book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe . The story, based on George Bernard Shaw 's 1913 play Pygmalion and on the 1938 film adaptation of the play, concerns Eliza Doolittle , a Cockney flower girl who takes speech lessons from professor Henry Higgins, a phonetician , so that she may pass as a lady. Despite his cynical nature and difficulty understanding women, Higgins grows attached to her.\n\nThe musical's 1956 Broadway production was a notable critical and popular success, winning six Tony Awards , including Best Musical . It set a record for the longest run of any musical on Broadway up to that time and was followed by a hit London production. Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews starred in both productions. Many revivals have followed, and the 1964 film version won the Academy Award for Best Picture .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn Edwardian London, Eliza Doolittle is a flower girl with a thick Cockney accent. The noted phonetician Professor Henry Higgins encounters Eliza at Covent Garden and laments the vulgarity of her dialect (\"Why Can't the English?\"). Higgins also meets Colonel Pickering, another linguist, and invites him to stay as his houseguest. Eliza and her friends wonder what it would be like to live a comfortable life (\" Wouldn't It Be Loverly ?\").\n\nEliza's dustman father, Alfred P. Doolittle, stops by the next morning searching for money for a drink (\" With a Little Bit of Luck \"). Soon after, Eliza comes to Higgins's house, seeking elocution lessons so that she can get a job as an assistant in a florist's shop. Higgins wagers Pickering that, within six months, by teaching Eliza to speak properly, he will enable her to pass for a proper lady.\n\nEliza becomes part of Higgins's household. Though Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted man who merely cannot get along with women (\"I'm an Ordinary Man\"), to others he appears self-absorbed and misogynistic . Eliza endures Higgins's tyrannical speech tutoring. Frustrated, she dreams of different ways to kill him (\"Just You Wait\"). Higgins's servants lament the stressful atmosphere (\"The Servants' Chorus\").\n\nJust as Higgins is about to give up on her, Eliza suddenly recites one of her diction exercises in perfect upper-class style (\" The Rain in Spain \"). Though Mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, insists that Eliza go to bed, she declares she is too excited to sleep (\" I Could Have Danced All Night \").\n\nFor her first public tryout, Higgins takes Eliza to his mother's box at Ascot Racecourse (\"Ascot Gavotte\"). Though Eliza shocks everyone when she forgets herself while watching a race and reverts to foul language, she does capture the heart of Freddy Eynsford-Hill. Freddy calls on Eliza that evening, and he declares that he will wait for her in the street outside Higgins' house (\" On the Street Where You Live \").\n\nEliza's final test requires her to pass as a lady at the Embassy Ball. After more weeks of preparation, she is ready. (\"Eliza's Entrance\"). All the ladies and gentlemen at the ball admire her, and the Queen of Transylvania invites her to dance with the prince (\"Embassy Waltz\"). A Hungarian phonetician, Zoltan Karpathy, attempts to discover Eliza's origins. Higgins allows Karpathy to dance with Eliza.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe ball is a success; Karpathy has declared Eliza to be a Hungarian princess. Pickering and Higgins revel in their triumph (\"You Did It\"), failing to pay attention to Eliza. Eliza is insulted at receiving no credit for her success, packing up and leaving the Higgins house. As she leaves she finds Freddy, who begins to tell her how much he loves her, but she tells him that she has heard enough words; if he really loves her, he should show it (\"Show Me\").\n\nEliza and Freddy return to Covent Garden but she finds she no longer feels at home there. Her father is there as well, and he tells her that he has received a surprise bequest from an American millionaire, which has raised him to middle-class respectability, and now must marry his lover. Doolittle and his friends have one last spree before the wedding (\" Get Me to the Church on Time \").\n\nHiggins awakens the next morning. He finds himself out of sorts without Eliza. He wonders why she left after the triumph at the ball and concludes that men (especially himself) are far superior to women (\"A Hymn to Him\"). Col. Pickering is concerned about Eliza's well-being, calling the police as well as contacting an old chum he believes will help them track her down.\n\nHiggins despondently visits his mother's house, where he finds Eliza. Eliza declares she no longer needs Higgins (\"Without You\"). As Higgins walks home, he realizes he's grown attached to Eliza (\" I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face \"). At home, he sentimentally reviews the recording he made the day Eliza first came to him for lessons, hearing his own harsh words. Eliza suddenly appears in his home. In suppressed joy at their reunion, Professor Higgins scoffs and asks, \"Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?\"",

It then played at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in mid-2012 before opening at the Garrick Theatre in the West End later the same year.",
        "synopsis": "ACT 1\n\nIn 1971, at technology company Arch Industries, high school student Michael Dork is mopping the corridors of the building. As Michael sneaks his way into the firm's computer room, he communicates with his best friend and accomplice Lucas Lloyd, who brings him a storage device, onto which Michael transfers the project he has been working on to develop a digital language that would allow computers to communicate with each other. However, the security alarm sounds before completion and Lucas and Michael attempt to escape the premises (\"Living In The Future Now\").\n\nThe next day, Michael and Lucas await the delivery of two brand-new teletype computers to their school, while friends Marvin and Francis are hard at work building the cardboard Star Trek starship they believe will earn them first prize at the annual sci-fi competition: the opportunity to meet the esteemed crew of the real Starship Enterprise , of which Uhura is of particular interest to the group. Michael's friends begin to tease him about the hostility shown towards Michael by Eddie Arch, son of the Head of Arch Industries, to which Michael responds that the opportunity to create his computer communication coding makes it all worthwhile. As Michael attempts to download his project onto the new equipment, however, the computer unexpectedly wipes all of Michael's work, so Lucas, Marvin and Francis rally around Michael in a unified attempt to reassure him (\"Don't Let 'Em Bring You Down\"). Elsewhere, Holly Manson is undergoing somewhat of a self-transformation (\"Little Things - Pre-Reprise\") and is excited about her realisation of her identity as a proud feminist, with ambitions of being the first female astronaut, which has so far eluded her owing to her \"Brains And Looks\" and so has decided she needs to be less attractive to be taken seriously. Eddie, meanwhile, thinks the opposite of himself and his girlfriend Leia feels the same. She has plans for the future for Eddie and herself, which she firmly believes are a certainty owing to the duo's exceedingly good looks. The principal of the school interrupts the daydreaming with the announcement that Michael's activity at Arch Industries the previous evening has earned him a ban from the school's computer lab.\n\nLater, during class, the principal introduces Holly to her new classmates, who mock her for her appearance, and matters are made worse when Holly announces her aspirations of going into space and her computing interests. Michael, however, realises that Holly might be his ticket to continuing his computer project, but is soon taunted by his classmates (\"Slacker\"), although the comments ultimately fail to distract Michael from his work. He and Lucas search for Holly after class and propose their plan to her, to which she agrees, much to the delight of the boys. Leia's friend Samantha is then seen to make allusions to her own brainy persona (\"Brains and Looks - Reprise\").\n\nSome weeks later, Michael and Holly's work is advancing much slower than anticipated, while Arch Industries seem to be making a breakthrough with their own network coding project. Michael and Lucas admit their individual feelings for Holly while Eddie attempts to find out from his father which section of Arch Industries he will lead after graduation (\"Little Things\"). It is decided between Michael's group of friends that they will back Michael up as he asks Holly out (\"Don't Let 'Em Bring You Down - Reprise\"). Leia, meanwhile, is unimpressed that Eddie is being sent to military school rather than an executive position at Arch Industries and turns her back on him (\"Slacker - Reprise\").\n\nAt The Planetarium, a nervous Michael meets Holly and after an ineffective attempt to deliver the terrible lines fed to him by Lucas via an earpiece, Michael instead decides to speak from the heart, before illuminating the stars of the Planetarium in a romantic gesture (\"We're Not Alone\"). Elsewhere, a dejected Eddie discovers Holly's previous persona by way of photographs shown to him by his friend Wayne and plans his next move. The schoolkids go on to imagine how they are going to change their lives (\"Ticket Outta Loserville\").\n\nACT 2\n\nThe sci-fi convention is underway (\"We're Not Alone - Reprise\"), where Francis and Marvin's model starship takes second place, edged out of the top spot by Samantha's flying saucer entry, and the boys congratulate her, particularly a smitten Marvin.\n\nLater, in the computer lab, a frustrated Michael and Holly turn down Lucas and Marvin's invitation to socialise but soon change their minds after deciding they are overworked. As Michael and Holly leave the lab, Lucas spots them and his envy towards Michael gets the better of him (\"Holly, I'm The One). Eddie appears and makes a proposal to Lucas: he will present Lucas' book to the publishing department at Arch Industries if Lucas steals Michael and Holly's work. Lucas accepts the deal.\n\nAs the group try to steal the disks on which the project is held, they are caught by Holly. Eddie suspects he has an advantage over Holly and warns her that with his newly acquired photo evidence he will expose her past and ruin her ambitions of space travel if she does not agree to work with him. Holly gives in to Eddie's demands after careful consideration (\"Long Run\"). Meanwhile, the kids at Samantha's victory party ponder \"What's So Weird About Me?\" Michael turns up searching for Holly and eventually sees her in an embrace with Eddie, which unbeknownst to Michael is only because Eddie has told Holly to seal her loyalty to him with a kiss. As Michael attempts to intervene, he is brushed off by Eddie and left all alone (\"Holly, I'm The One - Reprise\").\n\nHolly is not making the progress that Eddie expects of her and she is chastised by him, before being left to contemplate her frustrations towards Eddie (\"Sick\"). Lucas also has his own issues with Eddie as he finds out Eddie has not upheld his end of their bargain and confesses to Michael his part in Eddie's plot to tarnish Michael's work. Some time later, Holly has an idea about the missing component in the coding project so Eddie calls a press conference. Lucas, meanwhile, shows Michael the letter Holly wrote explaining her circumstances and tells Michael that Holly has informed him of the missing component: the address of the recipient, which was not taken into account by the work she had done alongside Michael. Lucas suggests that Michael demonstrates the breakthrough at the Arch Industries press conference in order to humiliate Eddie (\"Genius\").\n\nAt the conference, Michael sends the message as planned. Eddie's plan is foiled and Michael later reconciles with Holly (\"We're Not Alone - Reprise\").  As the students gather in the computer lab, Leia approaches Lucas and tells him how much she loved his book. Holly and Michael are cheered upon their entrance and the students erupt in celebration over their technological invention (\"Ticket Outta Loserville\").",

It tells the story of Addison Mizner and his brother Wilson Mizner 's adventures across America from the beginning of the twentieth century during the Klondike gold rush to the Florida real estate boom of the 1920s. The musical takes considerable liberties with the facts of the brothers' lives.\n\nThe history and evolution of the show are extraordinarily complex, with numerous different versions and recordings. After a 1999 workshop in New York City , the musical was produced in Chicago and Washington, D.C. in 2003 under the title Bounce . Although it did not achieve much success, it is notable due to its status as the last collaboration between writer-director duo Stephen Sondheim and Harold Prince . A revised version of the musical premiered Off-Broadway in New York in October 2008 where the show was redubbed Road Show to better reflect the show's story and themes.",
        "synopsis": "This is a synopsis of current version of Road Show used since the 2008 Off-Broadway Production.\n\nAfter the 1933 death of Addison Mizner, people who knew him, including his estranged lover Hollis Bessemer, comment on his life and the way he squandered his talents (\"Waste\"). Addison's younger brother Wilson appears and speaks to Addison, who angrily claims that Wilson was the cause of all his failures. The time shifts to Papa Mizner's death in California at the beginning of the twentieth century. On his deathbed, Papa charges his sons with the task of using their gifts to shape America (\"It's In Your Hands Now\"), telling them that there's a \"road\" to follow. Mama Mizner reveals the family's wealth has been eaten away by Papa's long illness and advises the boys to seek gold in Alaska ; Addison is reluctant, but goes along with Wilson anyway (\"Gold!\").\n\nIn the Klondike , the brothers share a sleeping bag and reminisce about their childhood (\"Brotherly Love\"). Wilson leaves to get supplies while Addison works the claim. Wilson is lured into a game of poker. Addison is shocked to discover his brother gambling. Wilson explains his newfound love of taking risks regardless of what's at stake (\"The Game\"). Wilson stakes their gold claim in a poker game and wins the saloon in which the game is taking place. (This episode is fictitious.) A shade of Papa Mizner appears and tells Addison that this was not what he had in mind for his sons.\n\nAddison leaves in disgust with his share of Wilson's winnings and travels around the world searching for business opportunities and a sense of purpose (\"Addison's Trip\"). All of his ventures fail due to bad luck. He is left with nothing but souvenirs that inspire him to take up architecture (so he can design a house in which to show them off). Wilson's businesses in Alaska also have failed, so he comes south to seek his brother's help. Wilson seduces and marries Addison's first client, a rich widow, and fritters away her money on various flashy endeavors, including fixed boxing matches and horse races (\"That Was A Year\").\n\nAlthough Wilson's various partners lose money, they remain fond of him because of the verve and energy with which he lives. Even Mama Mizner, who is being looked after by Addison and never receives any visits from Wilson, enjoys reading about Wilson's exploits, saying that she can live through him (\"Isn't He Something!\"). Only Addison remains uncharmed by Wilson, and when Wilson finally comes back, his resources exhausted, he finds that Mama has died in his absence. Addison angrily throws Wilson out of the house.\n\nLearning of rising property interests in Florida (\"Land Boom!\"), Addison decides to travel to Palm Beach to take advantage of the many rich people settling there who need houses built. (In reality, Mizner went there for his health.) On the train he meets the fictitious Hollis Bessemer, with whom he is smitten instantly. Hollis is the son of a wealthy industrialist, cut off by his father for refusing to enter the family business. His real passion is art, and although he is not talented, he dreams of creating an artist colony in Palm Beach with the help of his aunt, who is staying there in a hotel (\"Talent\").\n\nAddison shows Hollis's aunt a plan for a house he proposes to build for her. Impressed, she agrees and offers to sponsor Hollis's artist colony. However, Hollis and Addison, now lovers, are too busy designing resort homes for the rich (\"You\") and enjoying each other's company (\"The Best Thing That Ever Has Happened\") to follow up on Hollis's original plan. Wilson arrives at Hollis's and Addison's house, destitute and sick (\"The Game [Reprise]\"). Addison reluctantly takes him in, and when Wilson has recovered, he begins to work on Hollis, persuading him to be a patron to his newest scheme: to build a brand new city in Boca Raton with Wilson as promoter and Addison as chief architect (\"Addison's City\").\n\nWilson's con man instincts resurface. He promotes the Boca Raton real estate scheme with increasingly extravagant and eventually fraudulent claims, creating a price bubble (\"Boca Raton\"). Addison goes along, until it is Hollis who finally puts a stop to the real-estate scheme. He asks Addison to choose between Wilson and him. Addison, brought to a state of desperation, drives Hollis away by claiming he never loved him. Addison also orders Wilson out of his life (\"Get Out\"), but Wilson insists Addison loves him too much (\"Go\"). Addison agrees, but still wants him to go.\n\nWilson leaves for good, but not quite, for in the finale (as in the first scene) all the characters leave the stage except for Wilson and Addison. At this point, Wilson realizes that he, too, has died. The brothers bicker half-heartedly, their differences no longer mattering enough to keep them apart. Confronted by their father, they shrug off his criticisms and the brothers set out together on the road to eternity\u2014or, as Wilson calls it, \"the greatest opportunity of all\". \"Sooner or later\", he says, \"we're bound to get it right.\"",

The Music Man is frequently produced by both professional and amateur theater companies and is a popular choice for high school and college productions.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn the early summer of 1912, aboard a train leaving Rock Island , Illinois, Charlie Cowell and other traveling salesmen debate whether modern conveniences are making their profession more difficult. \"Professor\" Harold Hill is discussed as one whose sales skills make him immune from such changes (\"Rock Island\"). Charlie says that Hill is a con man who promises to form boys' marching bands, then skips town after taking payments for instruments and uniforms. Upon the train's arrival in River City, Iowa, a passenger leaves the train with a suitcase labeled \"Professor Harold Hill\".\n\nAfter townspeople of River City describe their reserved, \"chip-on-the-shoulder attitude\" (\" Iowa Stubborn \"), Harold sees his old friend and shill , Marcellus Washburn, who has \"gone legit\" and now lives in the town. Marcellus tells Harold that the only person who might expose him is the only trained musician in town, Marian Paroo, the librarian who gives piano lessons. He also informs Hill that a new pool table was just delivered to the town's local billiard parlor so, to launch his scheme, Harold convinces River City parents of the \"trouble\" that can come from a pool table in the community (\" Ya Got Trouble \"). Harold follows Marian home, attempting to flirt with her, but she ignores him. Marian gives a piano lesson to a little girl named Amaryllis while arguing with her widowed mother about her high \"standards where men are concerned\"; she mentions the man who followed her home (\"Piano Lesson/If You Don't Mind My Saying So\"). Marian's self-conscious 10-year-old brother Winthrop arrives home. Amaryllis, who secretly likes Winthrop but teases him about his lisp , asks Marian to whom she should say goodnight on the evening star, since she doesn't have a sweetheart. Marian tells her to just say goodnight to her \"someone\" (\"Goodnight, My Someone\").\n\nThe next day, bumbling Mayor Shinn and his overbearing wife Eulalie MacKecknie Shinn lead the festivities for Independence Day at the high school gym (\" Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean \") but are interrupted by a firecracker set off by troublemaker Tommy Djilas. Harold takes the stage and announces to the townspeople that he will prevent \"sin and corruption\" from the presence of the pool table by forming a boys' band (\"Ya Got Trouble [reprise]/ Seventy-Six Trombones \"). Mayor Shinn, who owns the billiard parlor, tells the bickering school board to get Harold's credentials, but Harold gets them to sing as a Barbershop Quartet to distract them (\"Ice Cream/Sincere\"). Harold also sets up Zaneeta, the mayor's eldest daughter, with Tommy, and persuades Tommy to work as his assistant. After another rejection by Marian, Harold is determined to win her (\"The Sadder But Wiser Girl\"). The town ladies are very excited about the band and the ladies' dance committee that Harold plans to form. He mentions Marian, and they imply (falsely, it turns out) that she had an affair with a now-deceased miser, who willed the library building to the town but left all the books to Marian. They warn Harold that she advocates \"dirty books\" by \" Chaucer , Rabelais and Balzac \" (\"Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little\"). The school board arrives to review Harold's credentials, but he leads them in song and slips away (\" Goodnight, Ladies \").\n\nThe next day, Harold walks into the library to woo Marian in earnest (\"Marian the Librarian\"). For a moment, she forgets her decorum and dances with Harold and the teenagers. Harold kisses her; when she tries to slap him, she accidentally hits Tommy instead. With Tommy's help, Harold signs up all the boys in town to be in his band, including Winthrop. Mrs. Paroo likes Harold and tries to find out why Marian is not interested. Marian describes her ideal man (\"My White Knight\", rewritten for the film version as \"Being in Love\"). She sets out to give Mayor Shinn evidence against Harold that she found in the Indiana State Educational Journal , but they are interrupted by the arrival of the Wells Fargo wagon , which delivers the band instruments (\"The Wells Fargo Wagon\"). When Winthrop is so happy about his new cornet , and totally abandons his shyness and self-consciousness, Marian begins to see Harold in a new light.  She tears the incriminating page out of the Journal before giving the book to Mayor Shinn.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe ladies rehearse their classical dance in the school gym while the school board practices their quartet (\"It's You\") for the ice cream social . Marcellus and the town's teenagers interrupt the ladies' practice, taking over the gym as they dance (\" Shipoopi \"). Harold grabs Marian to dance with her, and all the teenagers join in.  At the end of the dance, the Mayor angrily denounces Tommy's relationship with his daughter. Regarding Winthrop's cornet, Marian later questions Harold about his claim that \"you don't have to bother with the notes \". He explains that this is what he calls \"The Think System\", and he arranges to call on Marian to discuss it. The town ladies ask Marian to join their dance committee, since she was \"so dear dancing the Shipoopi\" with Professor Hill (\"Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little\" [Reprise]). They have reversed their opinions about her books, and they eagerly tell her that \"the Professor told us to read those books, and we simply adored them all!\"\n\nThat night, the school board tries to collect Harold's credentials again, but he gets them to sing again and slips away (\"Lida Rose\"). Marian, meanwhile, is sitting on her front porch thinking of Harold (\"Will I Ever Tell You?\"). Winthrop returns home after spending time with Harold and tells Marian and Mrs. Paroo about Harold's hometown (\"Gary, Indiana\"). As Marian waits alone for Harold, traveling salesman Charlie Cowell enters with evidence against Harold, hoping to tell Mayor Shinn. He only has a few minutes before his train leaves, but stops to flirt with Marian. She delays him so he won't have time to deliver the evidence, eventually kissing him. As the train whistle blows, she pushes him away. Charlie angrily tells Marian that Harold has a girl in \"every county in Illinois, and he's taken it from every one of them\u00a0\u2013 and that's 102 counties !\"\n\nHarold arrives, and after he reminds her of the untrue rumors he's heard about her, she convinces herself that Charlie invented everything he told her. They agree to meet at the footbridge, where Marian tells him the difference he's made in her life (\" Till There Was You \"). Marcellus interrupts and tells Harold that the uniforms have arrived. He urges Harold to take the money and run, but Harold refuses to leave, insisting, \"I've come up through the ranks... and I'm not resigning without my commission\". He returns to Marian, who tells him that she has known that he is a fraud since the third day after he arrived. (Harold earlier claimed to have graduated from the Gary Conservatory in 1905, but Gary, Indiana, was not founded until 1906.) Because she loves him, she gives him the incriminating page out of the Indiana State Educational Journal . She leaves, promising to see him later at the Sociable. With his schemes for the boys' band and Marian proceeding even better than planned, Harold confidently sings \"Seventy-Six Trombones\". As he overhears Marian singing \"Goodnight My Someone\", Harold suddenly realizes that he is in love with Marian; he and Marian sing a snatch of each other's songs.\n\nMeanwhile, Charlie Cowell, who has missed his train, arrives at the ice cream social and denounces Harold as a fraud. The townspeople begin an agitated search for Harold. Winthrop is heartbroken and tells Harold that he wishes Harold had never come to River City. But Marian tells Winthrop that she believes everything Harold ever said, for it did come true in the way every kid in town talked and acted that summer. She and Winthrop urge Harold to get away. He chooses to stay and tells Marian that he never really fell in love until he met her (\"Till There Was You\" [Reprise]). The constable then handcuffs Harold and leads him away.\n\nMayor Shinn leads a meeting in the high school gym to decide what to do with Harold, asking, \"Where's the band? Where's the band? \"  Marian defends Harold. Tommy enters as a drum major, followed by the boys in uniform with their instruments. Marian urges Harold to lead the River City Boys' Band in Beethoven 's Minuet in G . Despite the boys' limited musical ability, the parents in the audience are nonetheless enraptured by the sight of their children playing music. Even Mayor Shinn is won over, and, as the townspeople cheer, Harold is released into Marian's arms (\"Finale\").",

Is a musical with music and lyrics by Jeff Blim, and book by Jeff Blim, Matt Lang, and Nick Lang (additional music by Drew De Four).\n\nThe musical parodies  the video game series The Oregon Trail .  The characters' names were picked from suggestions shouted from the audience, and at the end the audience chooses which character dies.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe show begins with the father greeting the audience and introducing his wife, teenage daughter, seven-year-old son, and father-in-law (known as grandpa).  The father leads the audience in choosing the name of each character. (\"Gone To Oregon\"). In the filmed show on YouTube the father is named Jack Bauer , the mother is named Slippery When Wet , the grandpa is named Titty Mitty, the son is named Craphole and the daughter is named Mouthface. Father tries to convince the kids that the journey to Oregon will be fun and educational, while Mother passive-aggressively points out that Father burned down their farm. The journey begins in Independence, Missouri , and the family walks through the town, receiving honest but depressing advice from the townspeople (\"Independence!\"). They decide to go down to the general store to buy only bullets (their reasoning being that as a family of farmers, they don't need any food).\n\nDaughter is approached by a stranger named McDoon. As they flirt, he warns her about the famous outlaws The Bandit King and Cletus Jones. Upon hearing his name, Cletus appears and inadvertently reveals McDoon is the Bandit King. Mother arrives and scares McDoon away, much to the dismay of Daughter. As the women leave, McDoon vows revenge. In the meantime, the general store manager has swindled Father into purchasing a wagon in terrible condition for an outrageous price, along with a deformed ox .\n\nThey finally begin their journey, and while the rest of the family complain, Father enjoys the fun of the family road trip (\"The Grind\"). When the wagon breaks and the family discovers Son ate the food reserves, Mother sends Daughter, Son, and Grandpa to go hunting. After Daughter fails to hit small game, Grandpa hands the gun over the Son and tells his outlandish story about his war against the \u201clobsters\u201d in 1812 - he claims to have banished the lobsters to the sea, for which the lobsters retaliated by stealing the only million-dollar bill in the world, as it had Grandpa's face on it. Son is faced with a family of buffalo and a moral decision, while Daughter and Grandpa try to convince him to kill (\"Pays To Be An Animal\"). After Son guns down the buffalo , the family drag what little meat they can carry back to the wagon.\n\nAfter Daughter tells Mother that she thinks she is overbearing, Mother fakes death so that Daughter will admit she needs her. When Mother 'wakes up', Daughter claims she wishes she didn't have a family to care about and that the Bandit King would take her away. After she leaves, Mother laments her daughter's sadness, and expresses her love (\"When The World's At Stake\").\n\nFather tries to convince Mother to have sex, but fails several times. She finally agrees, only to be bitten by a snake as soon as they get in the bed together. Father saves her by sucking out the venom, but accidentally poisons himself. \nWhile in a coma , he hallucinates a mysterious voice telling him that the 'watchers' (the audience) will kill off one of the family members (\"Dysentery World\"). The family assumes Father is dead.  However, he abruptly awakens and tells them of the fate the voice described. McDoon is watching from afar, planning to take Daughter away and make her his bride, upsetting Cletus Jones (who has his own feelings for the thief). McDoon sets the family wagon on fire while Cletus kidnaps Daughter (\"Wagon on Fire\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe show restarts with Daughter in the wagon of The Bandit King, missing her family (\"Lost Without You\"). Her family arrives at a pub, where Mother pays for her drink with her wedding ring . Mother takes Son and leaves the pub to walk to Oregon, while Father is left with Grandpa. Grandpa gives Father a pep talk, admitting that he left the lobster world in disgrace after losing the love of his life to the lobster and his best friend, Cornwallis. The General Store Guy then enters the pub. Father decides that he will do anything to get back his family and approaches The General Store Guy, demanding a working wagon. When he refuses, Father threatens to shoot him and his partner, because he needed to fix his family no matter what (\"When The World's At Stake (Reprise)\"). The General Store Guy gives Father his wagon. Father takes the new wagon on the trail, picking up Mother and Son on the way. Mother is overjoyed, and takes the reins, setting the pace to grueling and the rations to barebones (\"Speedrun\").\n\nWhile the family races to Oregon, Cletus Jones reveals his jealousy to Daughter, who constantly rejects The Bandit King's advances. The trio come upon the Columbia River , and the bandits decide to float their wagon across the river (\"Caulk The Wagon\"). While in the river, they hit a rock that causes them to fall out. Daughter grabs onto a rock while the thieves are swept away. The family arrives just in time to see Daughter in the river. Father tells the family they will need to ford the river to save her. When Son protests, remembering a warning from an Independence town person, Mother declares they are a family. They manage to reach Daughter, but crash and wreck their wagon. Luckily, every member of the family is saved by Grandpa's lobster nemesis, Cornwallis.\n\nThe family is thrilled to see the Oregon border just a few yards away. When they reach the state line, they are stopped by a doctor (Joey Richter), who tells them only the healthy members of the party can continue to Oregon, and one of them (chosen earlier by the audience) is about to die of dysentery . The doctor announces the victim, who says their final goodbyes to the rest of the family, complete with all the sounds and smells of death by dysentery (\"You Gotta Go\").\n\nDetermined to reach Oregon as a family, the remaining members dragged the body across the border, and are amazed when the victim comes back to life thanks to the pure Oregon air (except in the case of Daughter and Mother, who were only pretending to be dead). Grandpa discovers his million-dollar bill in his pocket that the lobsters returned to him, and shares his fortune with his family. To celebrate, Son finally convinces the family to help realize his dream of skinny dipping (\"Naked In A Lake\").",

It features songs written by Lin-Manuel Miranda , Opetaia Foa\u02bbi , and Mark Mancina , and an original score also composed by Mancina. The film is set in ancient Polynesia and tells the story of Moana, the strong-willed daughter of a chief of a coastal village, who is chosen by the ocean itself to reunite a mystical relic with the goddess Te Fiti. When a blight strikes her island, Moana sets sail in search of Maui , a legendary demigod , in hopes of returning the relic to Te Fiti and saving her people. The screenplay takes inspiration from Polynesian myths .\n\nMoana premiered during the AFI Fest at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 14, 2016, and was released theatrically in the United States on November 23. The film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing $687\u00a0million worldwide.

        "synopsis": "On the Polynesian island of Motunui, the inhabitants worship the goddess of nature, Te Fiti; a living island who, long ago, brought life to the ocean using a pounamu stone as her heart and the source of her power. One day, Maui , the shape-shifting demigod of the wind and sea and master of wayfinding , stole Te Fiti's heart to give humanity the power of creation. This caused Te Fiti to disintegrate, and Maui was attacked by Te K\u0101, a volcanic demon. Maui lost both the heart and his magic fish hook to the depths of the sea.\n\nA thousand years later, the ocean chooses Moana , the daughter of Motunui's chief Tui, to return the heart to Te Fiti. Tui and Sina, Moana's parents, try to keep her away from the ocean to prepare her to become the island's chief. Sixteen years later, blight strikes the island, killing vegetation and shrinking the fish catch. Moana suggests going beyond the island's reef with her pet pig, Pua, to find more fish and discover what is happening, but Tui forbids it.\n\nMoana tries conquering the reef, but is overpowered by the tides and shipwrecked. That afternoon, Moana's grandmother Tala shows her a secret cavern of ships and reveals Motunui's people were voyagers until Maui stole Te Fiti's heart; the ocean was no longer safe without it. Tala explains Te K\u0101's darkness is destroying the island, but can be cured if Moana finds Maui and has him restore the heart of Te Fiti. Having been given the heart by the ocean, Tala gives it to Moana. Tala later becomes gravely ill and tells Moana to find Maui.\n\nMoana sets sail on a camakau from the cavern along with her dimwitted pet rooster , Heihei, who stowed away on it. They are caught in a typhoon and shipwrecked on an island, where she finds Maui, who boasts about his achievements. She demands Maui return the heart, but he refuses and traps her in a cave before leaving on her boat. She escapes and confronts Maui, who reluctantly lets her on the camakau. They are attacked by Kakamora, coconut pirates who seek the heart, but Moana and Maui outwit them.\n\nMoana realizes Maui is no longer a hero since he stole the heart and cursed the world, and convinces him to redeem himself by returning the heart. However, Maui first needs to retrieve his fishhook in Lalotai, the Realm of Monsters, from Tamatoa, a giant coconut crab . While Moana distracts Tamatoa, Maui retrieves his hook, only to find himself unable to control his shape-shifting. He is overpowered by Tamatoa, but Moana's quick thinking allows them to escape with the hook. Maui reveals his first tattoo was earned when his human parents abandoned him as an infant, and the gods, taking pity on him, granted him his powers. After reassurance from Moana, Maui teaches her the art of way-finding, regaining control of his powers, and the two grow closer.\n\nThey arrive at Te Fiti's island, only to be attacked by Te K\u0101. Moana refuses to turn back, resulting in Maui's hook being badly damaged. Unwilling to lose his hook again, Maui abandons Moana, who loses hope and tearfully asks the ocean to find someone else to restore the heart. The ocean obliges and takes the heart, but Tala's spirit appears, inspiring Moana to find her true calling. Moana retrieves the heart and sails back to confront Te K\u0101. Maui returns, having had a change of heart, and buys Moana time to reach Te Fiti by fighting Te K\u0101, destroying his hook in the process. Upon being unable to find Te Fiti, Moana realizes Te K\u0101 is Te Fiti, but corrupted without her heart. The ocean clears a path for Moana, allowing her to return the heart to Te Fiti, who heals the ocean and islands of blight. Maui apologizes to Te Fiti, who fixes his hook as well as Moana's boat before falling into a deep sleep and becoming an island.\n\nMoana bids farewell to Maui and Te Fiti, returning home and reuniting with her parents. After placing a shell on top of the stack of stones placed by all previous chiefs, Moana takes up her role as chieftess and wayfinder , leading her people as they resume voyaging, accompanied by Maui.",

        "description": "Zanna, Don't! (subtitled \"A Musical Fairy Tale\") is a 2003 musical written by Tim Acito with additional lyrics and material by Alexander Dinelaris . The story is set in a parallel universe where homosexuality is the norm and heterosexuality is a taboo: Zanna is the local matchmaker at Heartsville High, bringing happy couples together in mid-west America, but heterophobia strikes when a pair of opposite-sex highschoolers discover their feelings for each other. The show has been produced off-Broadway , off West End , and in regional theatres.",
        "synopsis": "The musical is set in Heartsville, U.S.A, once upon a time. The exact time period is not specified, but the play takes place across a school year, beginning on the first day and ending at prom. This is an alternate, fairy tale America, where the majority of the world is homosexual , with heterosexuals subject to heterophobia. Despite the fairy tale aspect, the world is essentially equivalent to ours, with references to Star Trek , the internet , Wayne Gretzky , and many other recognizable people, things or ideas. The majority of the play is set at Heartsville High, where the main characters are students.\n\nAs the school year begins, DJ and student Tank reminds the world that Zanna is on the look-out for any extra love that needs to be shared (\"Who's Got Extra Love?\"). Zanna finds new kid Steve Bookman (a quarterback) lonely. Zanna sets him up with Mike Singer, a chess champion and idol of school. (In the musical's world, chess players are sex symbols, and football players nobodies.) Their love blooms quickly (\"I Think We Got Love\").\n\nMeanwhile, Kate Aspero, all-around overachiever, finds love with Roberta, a part-time waitress. Kate had long resisted Zanna's efforts to find love for her, citing \" SATs , ACTs , APs , and GPAs\" as being more worthy of her time, while Roberta seemed destined to a life of cheating girlfriends. She laments this in \"I Ain't Got Time,\" much to the chagrin of the diner's customers. Spurred by Zanna's magic, Roberta impresses Kate so strongly (\"Ride 'Em\") that they become a couple.\n\nZanna, pleased with his success, settles down for the night, singing \"Zanna's Song\" as he says goodnight to his magic wand and goodbye to his feathered friend Cindy, who migrates to Fort Lauderdale.\n\nThe next day, the kids decide to create a musical addressing the controversy over heterosexuals in the military. Their play includes the song \"Be A Man,\" touting the impressive homosexual leaders of history (including Leonardo da Vinci , Alexander the Great , and the ancient Spartans ), and \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" an overly dramatic ballad about a heterosexual couple forced to hide their love from the Army.\n\nIn a reprise of \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\" Kate and Steve realize they have feelings for each other, a fact they try quickly to forget, as their town is extremely heterophobic.\n\nSome amount of time passes. At the \"I'm Okay, You're Okay Corral,\" Mike proposes moving in with Steve after graduation, but Steve, trying to avoid the issue, believes they should slow down. Three Corral regulars, Tex, Bronco, and Loretta, insist that love should go \"Fast.\" Steve, scared and confused runs from Mike, who describes Steve's unpredictable behavior in \"I Could Write Books.\" Later, and much to the amusement of Tex, Bronco, and Loretta, it is also revealed that Zanna has feelings for Steve.\n\nKate and Steve's perplexing behavior leads Mike and Roberta to playfully suggest to each other \"Don't You Wish We Could Be In Love?\", but the light-hearted song turns serious as Kate, Steve, and Zanna all join in, reflecting on their relationships.\n\nThe focus shifts to the State Chess Finals. Steve promises to exchange varsity rings with Mike after the match, while Kate puts all her effort into being a perfect girlfriend to Roberta. Mike's hesitation in the final match causes Roberta to lead a raucous cheer that becomes the song \"Whatcha Got?\"\u2014a successful cheer indeed, causing Mike to win the tournament.\n\nBut in the resulting celebration, Kate and Steve kiss, throwing the town into chaos. Mike, Steve, Kate, and Roberta are devastated (\"Do You Know What It's Like?\"). Kate and Steve run into classmates Candi and Buck, who have suddenly distanced themselves from the heterosexual couple.  Unable to handle living in a heterophobic environment, Kate and Steve plan to run away from Heartsville. Zanna, desperate to make the world safe for them, finds a spell that, while likely to cost him his powers (and a possible deterioration of taste and style), will make everything better, or so he hopes. Deciding that nothing done for love can ever hurt, Zanna performs the spell (\"'Tis a Far, Far Better Thing I Do/Blow Winds\").\n\nZanna's spell is a success, in a way. Kate and Steve are King and Queen of the Prom , and everyone there is singing \"Straight To Heaven.\" But Zanna finds that everyone is now heterosexual, and that no one can remember what life was like before the spell, to the point that Zanna himself is ostracized. He reflects on his life, hoping that \"Someday You Might Love Me.\" The students, overhearing this song, realize that they were mistaken in abandoning their friend, singing a reprise of \"Straight to Heaven\" with \"straight\" replaced with \"right.\" Prom is a success, and Zanna is invited to a post-prom party, but he chooses to stay behind and think for a while. On his way home, he drops a shoe, and true to fairy tales, Tank rushes to return it to him, revealing not just his memories of before the spell but his love of Zanna, begging \"Sometime, Do You Think We Could Fall In Love?\"\n\nThe happy couple is joined by the ensemble for a reprise of \"Sometime, Do You Think...\" at the curtain call.",

        "description": "High School Musical is a 2006 American musical television film produced by and aired on Disney Channel as part of the network's slate of original television films . The first installment of the High School Musical series , the film was directed by choreographer and filmmaker Kenny Ortega from a screenplay by Peter Barsocchini . It stars Zac Efron , Vanessa Hudgens , Ashley Tisdale , Lucas Grabeel , Alyson Reed , Corbin Bleu , and Monique Coleman . High School Musical follows student Troy Bolton (Efron), the captain of his school basketball team, and Gabriella Montez (Hudgens), an academically gifted transfer student, who together audition for the lead roles in their school musical , causing division among the school's cliques .\n\nDevelopment for the film began after Barsocchini approached the network in 2004 with a script idea for a musical film. Disney executives also wanted to replicate the success of the musical television film The Cheetah Girls (2003), as well as the standalone musical episodes of their television series Even Stevens (2000\u20132003) and That's So Raven (2003\u20132007). Principal photography for High School Musical primarily took place in Utah , with filming locations including East High School , Murray High School , and Salt Lake City . Additional filming took place in Los Angeles . The film has been described by Barsocchini and numerous critics as a modern adaptation of Romeo & Juliet .\n\nHigh School Musical premiered on Disney Channel on January 20, 2006. It became the most commercially successful Disney Channel television film. In the U.S., High School Musical generated 7.7 million viewers in its premiere broadcast, breaking the then-record for the highest premiere for the network. Internationally, the film also saw considerable success; as of 2019, over 225 million unique viewers were calculated as watched High School Musical .

Its lead single, \" Breaking Free \", reached number four on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 . Two sequels, High School Musical 2 and High School Musical 3: Senior Year , were released in August 2007 and October 2008 respectively.",
        "synopsis": "On New Year's Eve , high school juniors Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez are both vacationing at a ski lodge in Utah and meet when they are called up to sing a karaoke duet together (\"Start of Something New\") during a party. Troy returns home to East High School in New Mexico , where he is captain of the basketball team which his father coaches. By coincidence, Gabriella has just transferred to East High, and as Troy shows Gabriella around the school, drama club president Sharpay Evans assumes that Gabriella is interested in auditioning for the school musical. The jealous Sharpay discovers Gabriella's past academic achievements, and anonymously informs scholastic decathlon captain Taylor McKessie so she will recruit Gabriella for the team. During basketball practice, Troy is distracted by thoughts of Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing (\"Get'cha Head in the Game\").\n\nFrom the back of the auditorium, Gabriella and Troy watch Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan audition for the musical with an uptempo version of \" What I've Been Looking For \". Troy and Gabriella step forward at the last minute, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus tells them they are too late. While helping Kelsi Nielsen, the musical's composer, pick up sheet music, they give an impromptu performance of the same song at its original ballad tempo (\"What I've Been Looking For\" (reprise)). Overhearing their performance, Ms. Darbus gives them a callback audition.\n\nWhen the callback list is posted, Sharpay is furious that she has competition for the lead role, while the Wildcats basketball team is shocked that Troy has auditioned. After discovering that Troy is eager to step outside of the social norms, other students confess their secret passions and talents (\" Stick to the Status Quo \"). This alarms Taylor and Troy's best friend Chad Danforth , who work together to trick Gabriella into believing Troy does not care about her. Upset by what she perceives as Troy's betrayal and callous disregard for her (\"When There Was Me and You\"), Gabriella decides to not audition for the musical and distances herself from Troy. Realizing their mistake, Chad and Taylor admit their role in sabotaging Troy and Gabriella's relationship. Troy goes to Gabriella's house and they reconcile, determined to audition for the musical.\n\nOverhearing Gabriella and Troy rehearse, Sharpay convinces Ms. Darbus to reschedule the callback auditions so they begin at the same time as both Troy's championship game and Gabriella's scholastic decathlon competition. The basketball and decathlon teams work together to allow Troy and Gabriella to leave by hacking the power in the gym and causing a chemical reaction that forces an evacuation during the decathlon. Troy and Gabriella rush to the auditorium as Sharpay and Ryan finish their callback song (\"Bop to the Top\"). After Gabriella and Troy successfully perform their song \" Breaking Free \", Ms. Darbus gives them the lead roles, making Sharpay and Ryan understudies . Both teams win their respective competitions, Chad asks Taylor out, Sharpay makes a truce with Gabriella, and the entire school gathers in the gym to celebrate (\" We're All in This Together \").\n\nIn a post-credits scene , Sharpay praises Zeke for a bag of cookies he made for her, and he says he will make her a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e .",

The musical's lyrics and book are by Stew with music and orchestrations by Heidi Rodewald and Stew. It was created in collaboration with director Annie Dorsen .\n\nThe musical was developed at the Sundance Institute Theatre Lab in 2004 and 2005, one of the few works to be invited back for a second round of development. It had productions in Berkeley, California and Off-Broadway before opening on Broadway in 2008, garnering strong reviews and several awards. Spike Lee filmed the musical on Broadway in July 2008, premiering the film in 2009.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe Narrator introduces himself as Stew (\"Prologue\"), openly referring to himself, his collaborator Heidi, and the rest of the band, and occasionally interrupting the plot and interacting directly with the characters throughout the play. The Narrator introduces the African-American male protagonist as \"the Youth\"\u2014whom the Narrator also refers to as the \"hero\" or \"pilgrim\". In a late 1970s South Central Los Angeles middle-class neighborhood, the Youth begins searching for \"the real\" during his teenaged years, having just briefly turned to Zen Buddhism in defiance of his single mother 's conservative Christian faith (\"Baptist Fashion Show\"). Regardless, he is reluctantly dragged to her church and feels surprisingly moved by the church's gospel band, joyfully equating gospel to rock & roll (\"Blues Revelation / Freight Train\") and, deciding to explore the spiritual power of music, he joins the church choir (\"Edwina Williams\"). Here, he meets the pastor 's son and choir director, Franklin Jones, who as a marijuana-smoking closeted gay man, exposes the Youth to drugs, New Negro culture, and European philosophy (\"Arlington Hill\"). The Youth eventually begins playing guitar, deserts Franklin's choir, and forms a punk rock band (\"Sole Brother\"), which quickly dissolves during a bad LSD trip (\"Must've Been High\").\n\nThe Youth saves money to travel to Europe where he hopes to truly develop as a musical artist, despite his mother and community's disapproval (\"Mom Song / Philistines\"), culminating in an argument that satirizes the overly dramatic styles of European experimental cinema and which soon merges onstage into the actual journey to Europe (\"Merci Beaucoup, M. Godard\"). Now in promiscuous Amsterdam , with its easy access to drugs and sex (\"Amsterdam\"), the Youth experiences his first sense of acceptance when a local squatter , Marianna, unquestioningly accepts him into her apartment (\"Keys\"). After happily living among Marianna and other free-spirited artists (\"We Just Had Sex\"), he finds he cannot write songs when he has nothing to complain about. He heads to Berlin, leaving behind an upset Marianna, who tells him not to return (\"Paradise\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe Youth arrives in West Berlin during a May Day riot (\"May Day\"), joining some of the performance-artist protesters (\"Surface\"). His integrity falters when he misrepresents himself as poor to be accepted by the revolutionary artists whom he now lives with, collectively called Nowhaus. Desi, his new girlfriend and the Nowhaus leader, tells him that only love is real (\"Damage\").\n\nThe Youth can never bring himself to be honest about his background (\"Identity\"), though he basks in a romanticized African-American stereotype amidst his German friends (\"The Black One\"). Desi finally expresses her feelings that the Youth is concealing his true identity (\"Come Down Now\"). Meanwhile, he is irritated by his heartsick mother's phone calls and delays visiting her, even with Christmas approaching, when the other Nowhaus members abruptly return home to their families. The Youth pleads with Desi to stay with him during the holidays, but they fight over their differing views on love and she leaves him (\"Youth's Unfinished Song\").\n\nThe Narrator's self-reflections promptly enter into the Youth's story (\"Work the Wound\"), concluding with the unexpected scene of the Youth at his mother's funeral. With this surprisingly dramatic turns of events, the tone of the play shifts from largely comedic to suddenly heavy-hearted. The Narrator and the Youth confront each other directly and in a serious moment for the first time as the Youth copes with his grief; dealing with the loss of the same mother, it is clear now that the Narrator and Youth represent the same person at two different times in his life (\"Passing Phase\"). The Youth, after declaring that only art can correct the mistake known as life, resurrects his mother's spirit through his art (\"Is It Alright?\"). Ultimately, however, only the more mature Narrator remains onstage, professing the need for something beyond \"the real\" and that this is love (\"Love Like That\").",

        "synopsis": "The Huns invade China by breaching the Great Wall . The Emperor orders a general mobilization, with conscription notices requiring one man from each family to join the Imperial Army . Fa Mulan , an adventurous young woman, hopes to bring honor to her family. She is arranged to meet a matchmaker to demonstrate her fitness as a future wife, but is deemed a disgrace after several mishaps.\n\nFa Zhou, Mulan's elderly father and a renowned military veteran, is conscripted. Mulan tries dissuading him from going, but he insists that he must do his duty. Fearing for his life, she cuts her hair and takes her father's sword and armor, disguising herself as a man so that she can enlist in his stead. Quickly learning of her departure, Mulan's grandmother prays to the family's ancestors for Mulan's safety. In the family's temple, the spirits of the ancestors are awakened by Mushu , a small red dragon who is a disgraced former family guardian . The Great Ancestor decides that the powerful stone dragon guardian should guide Mulan, and sends Mushu to wake him. After accidentally destroying the guardian's statue, Mushu decides to redeem himself to the ancestors by personally aiding Mulan.\n\nReporting to the training camp, Mulan passes as a man named \"Fa Ping\", with Mushu providing encouragement and clumsy guidance throughout her deception. Under the command of Captain Li Shang , she and her fellow recruits\u2014including three named Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po\u2014gradually become trained soldiers. The Emperor's belligerent counsel, Chi-Fu , threatens to dissuade the Emperor from allowing Shang's men to fight. Mushu then writes a fake letter from Shang's father, General Li, ordering Shang to follow the main imperial army into the mountains. The reinforcements set out and discover that the Huns have slaughtered Li and his troops.\n\nAs the soldiers march up a mountain pass, the Huns' ruthless leader Shan Yu leads an ambush to attack them. Mulan uses a Huolongchushui cannon to trigger an avalanche and bury the Huns, but is badly injured. Shang and the soldiers discover Mulan's true gender while her wound is bandaged. Instead of executing Mulan as the law requires, Shang spares her life and expels her from the army before departing for the Imperial City to report the Huns' defeat. Mulan, however, later discovers Shan Yu and several of his warriors have survived. Mulan travels to the city to warn Shang just as the Huns seize the palace and take the Emperor hostage. In the ensuing fight, Shan Yu's men are quickly defeated and Mulan lures Shan Yu onto the roof, and ultimately pins him down with his own sword. Guided by Mulan, Mushu uses a giant skyrocket to propel Shan Yu into a fireworks launching tower, killing him.\n\nThe Emperor and the city's assembled inhabitants praise Mulan for having saved them, and they bow to her in honor. She accepts the Emperor's crest and Shan Yu's sword as gifts but declines his offer to join the royal council. Mulan returns home and presents these gifts to her father, but he ignores them, happy to have her back. While Mushu is reinstated as a Fa family guardian, Shang becomes enamored with Mulan and accepts her invitation to stay for dinner.",

        "synopsis": "The show begins with five New Yorkers sharing their dating disasters (\"The One\"). The scene shifts to an unnamed restaurant in modern-day New York City. Aaron, a quirky man, enters the restaurant and begins to talk with the waiter. Based on how nervous he is, the waiter guesses that this is a first date. After the waiter seats Aaron, an artsy woman named Casey enters the restaurant. She spies Aaron putting in eye drops as he waits for her, making her dread the date even more; she then orders strong drinks in hopes that the date will be quick and painless. Casey and Aaron exchange some small talk and it is revealed that the date was set up by Casey's sister, Lauren, whose husband Kevin is a co-worker of Aaron's. Through the small talk, they both develop first impressions of each other (\"First Impressions\").\n\nCasey's friend Reggie calls her during the date, offering for Casey to use his call as a way out of the date (\"Bailout #1\"), but Casey thinks enough of Aaron to ignore the call. Aaron and Casey begin to bond over friends from summer camp and high school after discovering their hometowns are near each other. Aaron casually makes a joke about Jewish geography, to which Casey responds she's not Jewish. This leads Aaron to a dream sequence where he imagines his dead Grandma Ida, who scolds Aaron for not dating a nice Jewish girl instead. Casey's extremely Christian father then shows up in Aaron's dream sequence, and tells Aaron that he is not happy with the idea of Aaron becoming his son in law. Next, Aaron imagines the son he could potentially have with Casey confronting him about which religion to choose and how he wishes he wasn't born (\"The Girl For You\").\n\nAaron nervously asks her questions about religion hoping that she does have some Jewish in her before discovering she is an atheist. Relieved, he makes a joke about Casey's views on spirituality (she believes in the power of meditation), but it backfires when he accidentally insults her. This results in a long awkward pause (\"The Awkward Pause\"). Casey is then visited in her mind by her sister Lauren, who urges Casey not to screw this date up, because \"Casey's biological clock is ticking,\" especially if she continues her current dating pattern of going the distance with bad boys on the first date and ruining any potential with nice guys like Aaron. Meanwhile, Aaron is visited by his best friend Gabe, who convinces him that the date is going well. However, Aaron then imagines his ex-girlfriend Allison, who tells him that she still sexually fantasizes about him (\"Allison's Theme #1\"). Gabe tells Aaron that he's romanticizing the memory of Allison, because he's only remembering the good things about her and not the bad things. He also tells Aaron to avoid bringing up Allison again, because it could ruin any future he might have with Casey.\n\nAaron decides to fix the date by making more jokes, which leads to talk of jobs. Aaron describes his job at Wall Street, and expresses that all he likes about the job is that it pays well. Casey works at an art gallery which makes her somewhat happy because she can study her craft, photography. Aaron mentions how good her exhibit looked which leads Casey to conclude that he googled her before the date. She immediately does the same thing to him, and the two of them bond over embarrassing stuff on the internet (I.E. Aaron played Dolly in his high school production of Hello Dolly) (\"The World Wide Web is Forever\" or \"Total Loser\").Casey is hungry so she asks Aaron to leave the bar and eat dinner with her. Casey initially wants to order a burger, but Lauren tells her it will give the impression that years from now she will be overweight, so she orders a salad instead. Aaron, on the other hand, wants a salad, but Gabe tells him that \"salads are for wussies,\" so he orders a burger.\n\nHaving overheard Casey talking to herself about wanting a burger, Aaron asks her why she ordered the salad, convinced that she wants to give the impression of being careful about her body. She ignores him, but he says that he doesn't care what a girl looks like as long as she's happy. Casey is taken aback by this, having never dated anyone who would have said something like that. She imagines her two ex-boyfriends berating her and telling her why she should love them, stating \"reasons\" such as \"I failed my GED\" or \" I only cheated on you twice\" (\"That's Why You Love Me\"). This makes Casey miss dating \"bad boys,\" leading her to ask Aaron if he's a bad boy, to which he replies with a no. Casey hastily calls off any potential relationship, saying they can be \"just friends\". Aaron offers to try to be a bad boy for her, but admits it probably wouldn't work.\n\nCasey's phone rings again, with another call from Reggie, who is beginning to feel ignored (\"Bailout #2\"). When Aaron leaves the table to go to the bathroom, Lauren visits Casey once more, where Casey admits that she builds up walls to keep herself from getting hurt, despite her desire for a real, healthy relationship. She explains that she only dates \"bad boys,\" or jerks, because she doesn't get her hopes up and is less disappointed when things don't work out. It is then revealed that her upbringing greatly influenced how she views relationships, having grown up with a mentally unstable mother and a father who left them and started a new family. Lauren, on the other hand, met her future husband in college at 24, and is happily married, confusing Casey's view of relationships even more (\"Safer\").\n\nWhen Aaron returns to the table, he and Casey decide to officially call off the date. The waiter who seated them notices that they are the only ones not having a good time, so he performs a musical number that he wrote himself as the other two couples slow dance together. He pulls up Casey to dance, and pushes her to dance with Aaron (\"I'd Order Love\"). Their food finally arrives and Aaron, with what little hope he has left that things will end well, begs her to have just this one meal with him. Casey agrees, but decides she wants to set Aaron up with one of her friends to make up for their bad date. She asks him what kind of girl is his type, which gets him thinking about Allison again (\"Allison's Theme #2\"). She asks him if he wants a bad girl or somebody to take home to his mom, and Aaron says that he could probably bring any girl home to his mother. Casey begins to tease him, thinking this means his mom hates all of girls Aaron dates, but Aaron admits that his mother died when he was in tenth grade. He imagines her telling him everything she wished she had said to him, based on a letter she left him (\"The Things I Never Said\").\n\nCasey is truly touched by Aaron's story and honesty, and subsequently ignores her phone when it rings again. Reggie is now convinced that Aaron killed her or kidnapped her because she hasn't picked up her phone, so he declares that he's coming to rescue her (\"Bailout #3\"). Casey realizes that she's beginning to like Aaron, and she asks him if they can switch their food so that they can both have what they want. She then remembers that she promised to set Aaron up with a friend, so she begins listing friends who would be a good match for Aaron. Casey ultimately decides it's her new friend Allison, which scares Aaron, thinking Casey is talking about his ex-girlfriend Allison. Much to Aaron's relief, it's not the same Allison, but Casey asks him why he reacted to dramatically to the name Allison. Aaron tells Casey about his relationship with Allison, and how she ended up leaving him at the altar. Casey decides to make Aaron try an exercise where he imagines Allison is standing right in front of him, and he has to break up with her. It doesn't start well, with Aaron only talking about how much he loves Allison, but with Casey's encouraging, he gets angry at Allison and lists everything he hated about her and how horribly she treated him (\"In Love With You\"). Casey and Aaron share an ecstatic embrace after Aaron's cathartic exchange with an imaginary Allison.\n\nAfter Casey and Aaron finish their dinner, the waiter brings them the check. The whole restaurant freezes, wondering who is going to pay for dinner (\"The Check!\"). Casey wants them to split it but Aaron pays it, insisting that he genuinely wants to buy her dinner. Casey realizes that she likes Aaron so much that she doesn't want to ever have to say goodbye to him, so she ignores him as he leaves. Lauren appears again, angry at her for screwing things up again, but Casey ignores her. The restaurant closes, so Casey walks out; she then realizes what a big mistake she's made. After she has left, Reggie runs into the restaurant, only to discover that Casey is not dead and left alone. Exhausted, he decides to have a drink with the waiter, and the two of them form their own first impressions of each other (\"First Impressions (reprise)\"). The scene then shifts to the next block, where Casey stops Aaron from entering the subway to go home. She asks him to walk her home, which he does. Along the way, Casey decides that she feels a true connection and sees potential with Aaron, and Aaron feels like he would be willing to risk his heart again if it was for Casey. Throughout the walk, all of the voices that have been talking to them all night voice their opinions but Casey and Aaron ignore them. When they reach Casey's apartment, they say goodnight to each other and go their separate ways. However, Casey stands in front of her apartment building, not wanting to actually walk inside and leave Aaron, and Aaron can't seem to walk further down the street to leave. Casey and Aaron sing the last verse on opposite sides of the stage, and as Casey and Aaron finish the song, they run from opposite sides of the stage and kiss (\"Something That Will Last\").",

        "description": "Mamma Mia! (promoted as Benny Andersson & Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus' Mamma Mia! ) is a jukebox musical written by British playwright Catherine Johnson , based on songs recorded by Swedish group ABBA and composed by members Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus . The musical's title is taken from the group's 1975 chart-topper \" Mamma Mia \". Ulvaeus and Andersson were involved in the development of the show from the beginning, while singer Anni-Frid Lyngstad was involved financially in the production and also appeared at many of the premieres around the world.\n\nThe musical includes hits such as \" Super Trouper \", \" Lay All Your Love on Me \", \" Dancing Queen \", \" Knowing Me, Knowing You \", \" Take a Chance on Me \", \" Thank You for the Music \", \" Money, Money, Money \", \" The Winner Takes It All \", \" Voulez-Vous \", \" SOS \" and \" Mamma Mia \".

A film adaptation starring Meryl Streep , Colin Firth , Pierce Brosnan , Amanda Seyfried , Christine Baranski , Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Julie Walters was released in 2008.\n\nAs of 2024, the show has productions in London's West End , where it is the fifth longest-running show in West End history and the third longest-running musical, as well as various foreign productions. Its Broadway incarnation closed on 12 September 2015 after running for nearly 14 years, making it the ninth longest-running show in Broadway history .",
        "synopsis": "Before the curtain rises, the orchestra starts playing the overture , which is a montage of instrumental versions of some of Abba's hit songs.\n\n### Act I\n\nOn the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi, 20-year-old Sophie is preparing to marry her fianc\u00e9, Sky. She wants her father to walk her down the aisle but does not know his identity (\" Prologue \"). She discovers her mother Donna's diary and finds old entries that describe dates with three possible fathers: an American architect named Sam Carmichael, an Australian writer and adventurer named Bill Austin, and a British banker named Harry Bright. She sends each an invitation to her wedding without telling Donna. All three men accept (\" Honey, Honey \").\n\nDonna reunites with her long-time best friends, Tanya, a rich woman who has been married and divorced thrice, and Rosie, an unmarried and carefree woman, at her taverna. The trio used to comprise a girl group called \"Donna and the Dynamos\". Donna laments about the struggles of running the taverna singlehandedly (\" Money, Money, Money \").\n\nLater that day, Sam, Bill, and Harry arrive at the island. They meet Sophie who convinces them not to tell Donna that she had invited them (\" Thank You for the Music \"). Donna is astonished to see her ex-lovers and runs off in tears (\" Mamma Mia \"). Tanya and Rosie attempt to comfort Donna (\" Chiquitita \"), and convince her that she can still be the girl she once was (\" Dancing Queen \").\n\nSophie tells Sky about her confusion regarding her father's real identity, but still does not reveal that she had invited them. Sky assures her he will be the only man she ever needs, right before his buddies take him to his bachelor party (\" Lay All Your Love on Me \"). At Sophie's bachelorette party, Donna and the Dynamos don their old costumes and perform a song (\" Super Trouper \"). Sam, Bill, and Harry accidentally walk in on the party, and the guests persuade them to stay (\" Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight) \").\n\nSophie is unable to find any concrete answers from talking to either Sam or Harry, however she learns from Bill that he has an aunt Sophia who once lived with Donna and funded the taverna's construction. This leads both to believe Bill is Sophie's father and he reluctantly agrees to walk her down the aisle (\" The Name of the Game \"). The bachelor and bachelorette parties converge, where both Sam and Harry respectively tell Sophie they believe they're her father and promise to walk her down the aisle the next day. Hopelessly confused, Sophie leaves the party, unsure who to believe (\" Voulez-Vous \").\n\n### Act II\n\n( Entr'acte ) Sophie has a nightmare, involving her three possible fathers all fighting for the right to walk her down the aisle and wakes up distressed (\" Under Attack \"). Donna is confused as to why Sophie is so upset on her wedding day, while Sophie emotionally blames Donna for raising her without a father. Donna is left to reminisce on her past relationships (\" One of Us \"). She gets into an argument with Sam; despite their conflict, Donna and Sam still love one another and wish their relationship had worked out differently (\" SOS \").\n\nAt the beach, a worker at Donna's taverna named Pepper makes advances to Tanya, but she rebuffs him (\" Does Your Mother Know \"). Sky figures out Sophie's plan and feels betrayed that she kept it a secret from him. Sam tries to give Sophie some fatherly advice by describing his own failed marriage (\" Knowing Me, Knowing You \"), but Sophie is not consoled. Harry offers Donna to pay for the wedding, and they reminisce about their fling (\" Our Last Summer \").\n\nDonna helps Sophie get dressed for the wedding, in disbelief that her daughter is going to be a bride (\" Slipping Through My Fingers \"). They reconcile and Sophie asks Donna to walk her down the aisle, since she's the most active parental figure in her life. Sam tries speaking to Donna again, and a bitter confrontation ensues as Donna tells Sam that he broke her heart (\" The Winner Takes It All \"). Rosie is making final wedding preparations when Bill expresses disappointment that Donna has been selected to walk Sophie down the aisle. Bill reaffirms his commitment to single life, but Rosie confesses she has grown attracted to him, and urges him to reconsider (\" Take a Chance on Me \"). They become intimate just before getting interrupted by the arrival of guests, leaving Rosie quite stunned.\n\nThe wedding begins, with Donna walking Sophie down the aisle. Donna interrupts the ceremony and acknowledges to everyone that Sophie's father is present. Sophie finally tells her mother that she had secretly invited the three men, and Donna reveals she is also unsure which one is her father. Everyone involved agrees that the identity of Sophie's biological father does not matter, and all three are happy to be \"one-third of a father\" and a part of her life at last. During this discussion, Harry reveals he's in a committed gay relationship. Just as the wedding is about to resume, Sophie calls a halt to the proceedings and Sky agrees they are not ready to get married yet. Sam seizes his chance and proposes to Donna to prevent the wedding preparations from going to waste. He explains that he always loved her, and years ago had ended his own engagement and returned to the island only to find Donna had gone off with another man (Bill). Donna accepts and the two marry spontaneously (\" I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do \"). At the end of the night, Sophie and Sky depart Kalokairi to tour the world together (\" I Have a Dream \").\n\n### Finale and encore\n\nAfter their final bows to the audience, the ensemble performs a reprise of \" Mamma Mia \". A reprise of \" Dancing Queen \" follows, during which Donna, Tanya and Rosie are revealed wearing brightly colored ABBA inspired costumes. The cast ends the finale with \" Waterloo \", during which Sam, Bill, and Harry join the rest of the cast onstage in brightly colored costumes that match the leading ladies. The Dynamos and the dads often invite the audience to clap, dance, and sing along during the finale.",

The \"Summer Night City\" scene was a wedding rehearsal and during the song, Ali, Lisa, Tanya, and Rosie arrived on the island. The song was removed, although a small instrumental part of it remains as underscoring to connect the end of \"The Winner Takes It All\" and \"Take a Chance on Me\". Several lines of \"Summer Night City\" are also heard in the \"Entr'acte\".\n\nDonna hums a few lines of \" Fernando \" when she repairs the doors of the taverna just before she sees her three former lovers.\n\nThe song that Sky briefly sings before starting \"Lay All Your Love on Me\" varies from one production to another, including \" King Kong Song \", \" Summer Night City \", \" Dum Dum Diddle \", and \" She's My Kind of Girl \", a Bj\u00f6rn & Benny song.\n\nThe wedding march that is played as Sophie walks down the aisle is a slower arrangement of \" Dancing Queen \".\n\nThe creators also intended to include \" Just Like That \", an unreleased ABBA song recorded in 1982. The song was apparently dropped just before the first public previews in March 1999, though it was listed in the program available during the preview period.\n\nThe last three songs, performed as an encore/finale by the whole cast are: \" Mamma Mia \", \" Dancing Queen \" and \" Waterloo \". The version of \" Mamma Mia \" used in the encore/finale is sung by the Company. The finale song Mamma Mia has been extended in theatres where Donna and the Dynamos had to go downstairs for taking the stage lift in Dancing Queen. Then, during the intro of \" Dancing Queen \", Donna, Tanya and Rosie join the Company (as the girl-power band \"Donna and the Dynamos\", wearing ABBA's 1970s-style colourful and flashy costumes). Sam, Bill and Harry join them during Waterloo, wearing male versions of the girls' ABBA's costumes. The Encore is included on the 5th Anniversary Cast Recording (commemorating said anniversary for the Broadway production).",

Three young women working in an agency named Dixie Foley, Daphne O' Connor and Susan Moore ( Alice Faye , Patsy Kelly , and Frances Langford ) have built a singing trio. They want to 'lease' the Dictaphone of their boss, Mr. Huxley ( John Dilson ) to make a record of their singing, but they are caught and fired. When they are not able to pay their rent any longer, they decide to try their luck on an amateur contest at a radio station, hosted by a Major Bowes-type named Colonel Dave ( Walter Catlett ). Several talents approach the microphone, including The Radio Rogues, an Italian who sings opera terribly, and an elderly chicken impersonator aptly named Henrietta ( Florence Gill ).\n\nDue to lack of food, Susan becomes unconscious while singing and the contest is won by a blue-collar big band led by Tops Cardona ( George Raft ). They become involved with Tops after he is impressed by Susan's singing at a caf\u00e9 run by a German named Joe Schmidt ( Herman Bing ). Tops offers them a job with his band at the radio station. They accept, are christened The Swanee Sisters by Tops to give them a southern flavor, and he buys them matching outfits. Tops and the girls soon become a nationwide hit once they land a sponsor (who happens to be their old boss, Mr. Huxley), but after a while, they grow tired of working constantly and not having any fun, and leave the band indefinitely. Daphne insists they attend a party (in the furs Tops bought for them), leaving Tops to fend for himself.\n\nThey accept an invitation to appear at a party held on a yacht by a Mrs. Reginald Herring-Smythe (Claudia Coleman). After meeting several unsavory rich people at the soiree, and feeling a bit sour after mixing with the \"creme de la creme\", they adjourn to an anteroom with a radio in it.

The show tells the story of medieval composer, mystic, scientist, and Catholic saint Hildegard von Bingen \u201con her path to sainthood from childhood,\u201d primarily depicting the thirty years she spent locked up in a cell with her mentor, the anchoress Jutta von Sponheim .\n\nThe show was commissioned by LCT3 as part of Grace McLean's artist in residency series.

The production was directed by Lee Sunday Evans , with orchestrations by McLean and Kris Kukul, and music direction by Ada Westfall.\n\nIn the Green won the Richard Rodgers Award for Musical Theater and was nominated for seven Lucille Lortel Awards , with Grace McLean winning Best Actress in a Musical for her role as Jutta.",
        "synopsis": "In the Green starts with a hymnal song (\"O Virga ac Diadema\"). The actual storyline begins with Jutta in her cell reading her last rites, choosing to live the rest of her life as a dead person and receiving only food and water left at a small window and preparing for Hildegard's arrival; at 8 years old, a young Hildegard (portrayed by a puppet) is left with Jutta (\"Death Ceremony\").\n\nOriginally, Hildegard (now portrayed by Rachael Duddy as \"Eye,\" Hannah Whitney as \"Hand,\" and Ashley P\u00e9rez Flanagan as \"Mouth,\" with each actress holding a puppet of the sense they respectively represent) expresses her resistance to staying in Jutta's cell and desire to go home, before describing how she  has too many desires but ultimately wants to be \"whole\" (\"If I Had a Knee\"). Jutta then says she too was once \"broken like [Hildegard]\" and says she will guide Hildegard into becoming whole and \"free,\" with Hildegard agreeing (\"The Rule\"). Time passes, and Mouth expresses her hunger and her feelings of being inside the cell for so long, before experiencing her first period (\"I Am Hungry\").\n\nIn response, Jutta explains that because of Eve 's actions all women must pay and \"carry her curse in [their] blood,\" while also telling Mouth to repress her hunger to gain control over herself and become whole as she aims (\"Eve\"). A year passes, with Hildegard becoming more frustrated that she is still broken (\"Ritual\"). Jutta continues to teach Hildegard lessons to become whole, this time saying that they will spend more time dead than alive and advising her to stop wanting things, to stop sleeping, and continue digging since life is painful anyway (\"Little Life\"). The two women take a break, and seeing a ray of sunlight coming through the cell window, Hand describes her time outside with a woman named Agatha while Jutta remembers her past betrothal and subsequent running away, before Hand asks about being \"free\" and going outside (\"Sun Song\"). This conversation with Hand brings back suppressed memories where Shadow (Jutta's repressed trauma personified) and Jutta sing about her would-be husband finding her after running away, and Jutta's sexual assault in a garden; Jutta refuses to think on this, forcing Shadow to leave and covering the sunlight, before arguing with Hildegard (\"In the Green\").\n\nAll three aspects of Hildegard get angry at Jutta, and Jutta decides she will no longer help Hildegard become whole. Eye, Hand, and Mouth all turn on each other and blame each other for Agatha's death, falling apart and choosing to \"dig\" because Hildegard believes she will never become whole and digging is the only thing she can control (\"Burial\"). While digging, Shadow is found in the Underground (a place full of darkness) hiding since she is unwanted, and tells Hildegard that she can join Shadow in the Underground (\"Underground\"). While in the Underground, Hildegard and Eye, Hand, and Mouth piece together the memories that make Hildegard broken; she remembers Agatha (who the audience now understands to be Hildegard's elder sister) sneaking out at night and having sex with a man, telling her mother about what Agatha is doing, describing Agatha's pregnancy and their nighttime outing to pick pennyroyal so Agatha can abort her baby, which leads to Agatha bleeding to death (\"Confession\"). Hildegard pauses before describing the last thing Agatha told her as she was dying, to which Shadow tells her she doesn't have to, but once Hildegard does, she feels better, even if she's still broken (\"Sun Song (Reprise)\"). Shadow is in awe of Hildegard, Eye, Hand, and Mouth for working with their trauma and wants them to stay with her in the Underground; realizing that Shadow is Underground because she too was broken by her trauma, they try to encourage her to share her memories so Shadow can become whole, to which Shadow refuses (\"Light Undercover\").\n\nThrough these conversations, Hildegard has a realization about becoming whole and understands that everything Jutta has been trying to teach her has always been inside of her, and with the help of each other Shadow and Hildegard feel they'll be \"alright\" (\"The First Verb\"). Shadow and Hildegard move from the Underground back into Jutta's cell (\"O Viridissima Virga\"). Hildegard, Eye, Hand, and Mouth tell Shadow that she too contains light like them, and that's what they've been digging for this whole time; they've been hiding themselves and while those hidden parts make them broken, that is how they have the light they've been searching. Emboldened by Hildegard, Eye, Hand, and Mouth, Shadow divulges some of her feelings and the sensations she remembers from her sexual assault (\"Light Undercover/In the Green (Reprise)\"). Meanwhile, Jutta steadfastly refuses to acknowledge anything Hildegard or Shadow say. Jutta reflects on her own life, saying she's \"done all the things [she's] supposed to\" and yet cannot see the light like Hildegard or Shadow, but is grateful for her life all the same. She expresses maternal love for Hildegard, before dying (\"The Ripening\"). Hildegard, Eye, Hand, and Mouth reflect on Jutta's teachings while grieving their mentor's death (\"Forgiveness\"). Hildegard leaves the cell to experience what she's \"never known before.\" She then explains her thoughts on Catholicism through her life and the growing corruption and tensions within the Church (\"Integration\"). The show ends with Hildegard meeting Sigewize, a young Cathar girl who expresses similar sentiments to Hildegard at the beginning of the show of being \"'too much,'\" trying to be understood, and asks Hildegard to \"see [her]\" and think about the impact of her speeches when people kill in Hildegard's name (\"Exorcism\").",

        "synopsis": "### Prologue\n\nTeenaged Dorothy Gale lives with her Aunt Em , Uncle Henry , and dog, Toto , on their farm in Kansas . Though her work there keeps her busy, she often gets distracted in her boredom with farm life, choosing instead to play with Toto and dream of someday seeing far-off lands. Aunt Em, however, has little patience for her daydreaming, believing that dawdling is contrary to their way of life. After an argument, Aunt Em apologizes to her for an unintentionally hurtful remark. She explains that she only scolds because she wants Dorothy to be the best she can be, and fears that she will not be prepared for the responsibilities life will soon put upon her. Aunt Em loves her dearly and hopes they will always be as close as they were when she was younger (\"The Feeling We Once Had\").\n\n### Act I\n\nWhen an approaching storm turns out to be a tornado , Dorothy takes shelter in the farmhouse as Aunt Em and Uncle Henry do so in the storm cellar . As the tornado hits the farm, the house, with Dorothy inside, is lifted into the air and flies for miles, with the wind represented by dancers (\"Tornado\"). The house finally comes to rest with a bump in the middle of a field covered with flowers. There Dorothy is met by the Munchkins , all of whom are dressed in blue, and Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North , who tells her that she is in the Land of Oz . Furthermore, her house has fallen on Evamean, the Wicked Witch of the East , and killed her, freeing the Munchkins from her evil powers. Dorothy, distressed and confused, wants only to return home. With her magic unable to take Dorothy beyond the country boundaries, Addaperle decides Dorothy's best chance for assistance is to follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City in the center of Oz, to see the great and powerful Wizard of Oz , or \"The Wiz\" for short (\"He's the Wizard\"). She gives her Evamean's silver shoes , and tells her not to take them off before she reaches home, for they hold a mysterious, but very powerful charm that will keep her safe.\n\nDorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road, full of doubt and fear at what lies ahead (\"Soon As I Get Home\"). Stopping to rest by a cornfield, she is startled when a scarecrow hanging on a pole strikes up a conversation with her (\"I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday\"). He tells her of his longing for brains so that he can be like other people, and she invites him to accompany her to see if the Wizard can help him. (\" Ease On Down the Road #1\").\n\nThe Yellow Brick Road leads them into a great forest where they discover a man made of tin , rusted solid. They oil his joints (\"Slide Some Oil To Me\") and he tells them how Evamean put a spell on his axe so that it began to cut off parts of his body. Each time it happened, a tinsmith replaced each missing part with one made of tin until he was entirely made of it. The one thing the tinsmith forgot was a heart, and he has longed for one ever since. Dorothy and the Scarecrow invite him on their journey to see the Wizard with the hope that he may give him one (\"Ease On Down the Road #2\").\n\nThey continue following the Yellow Brick Road deeper into the forest, where they are attacked by a large lion (\"I'm a Mean Ole Lion\"). However, he is quickly revealed to be a coward hiding behind bravado as Dorothy stands up for her friends. When he learns where they are going, he apologizes and asks if he may accompany them to ask the Wizard for some courage. They agree and the trio becomes a quartet (\"Ease On Down the Road #3\"), but face a new danger when they are attacked by an evil tribe of forest monsters called Kalidahs (\"Kalidah Battle\"). After a great fight and harrowing escape, they stop by the road to rest. The Lion is embarrassed by his cowardice in the battle, but is comforted by Dorothy's kind words (\"Be a Lion\").\n\nSeeing a green glow in the distance, they continue their journey to the Emerald City, and wander into a field of poppies who blow opium dust on them.  Dorothy recalls that Addaperle warned her of these poppies, and runs from the field as fast as she can with the Scarecrow and Tin Man behind her. The Lion is overcome by the dust and begins to hallucinate (\"Lion's Dream\"). He is dragged from the field and returned to his friends by the Mice Squad who police the area.\n\nMarching up to the gates of the Emerald City, they are met by the Gatekeeper who insists they must all be fitted with a pair of green tinted glasses that are locked on to prevent them being blinded by the dazzling sights. They enter the city and look about in awe at the richly dressed people that inhabit it (\"Emerald City Ballet\"). The haughty and condescending people laugh and ridicule this odd group for wanting to see the Wizard until they see that Dorothy is wearing Evamean's silver shoes. They are promptly shown right into his palace.\n\nOnce in the throne room, they are assaulted by a great show of lights, smoke, and pyrotechnics as the Wizard appears before them (\"So You Wanted To Meet the Wizard\"). They each plead their case to him, the Tin Man doing so in song (\"What Would I Do If I Could Feel?\"). He agrees on one condition: they must kill Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West . With their goals seeming further out of reach than ever before, they sink to the floor in despair.\n\n### Act II\n\nEvillene rules over the land of the west, enslaving its people, the Winkies. She is evil, power hungry, and ruthlessly determined to get her hands on her sister's silver shoes, so that she may increase her power and rule over all of Oz (\"Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News\"). Receiving word of Dorothy and her friends approaching, she sends her Winged Monkeys to kill them (\"Funky Monkeys\"). Catching up to them in the forest surrounding her castle, the monkeys dash the Tin Man against rocks until he falls apart, and rip the straw out of the Scarecrow, leaving both of them helpless. Seeing Dorothy's silver shoes, however, they dare not harm her. Instead, they carry her to Evillene's castle along with the Lion. While searching for a way to get the shoes from Dorothy, Evillene forces her and the Lion to do menial chores around her castle. She takes delight in torturing the Lion before Dorothy, threatening to have him skinned unless she hands over the silver shoes. Angered by this, she picks up a bucket of water and throws it over Evillene, who melts away. Her spell on the Winkies is lifted, and they show their thanks by restoring the Scarecrow and Tin Man to top condition, and reuniting the group (\" Everybody Rejoice/A Brand New Day \").\n\nReturning to the Emerald City, they see the Wizard (now a booming voice that seems to come from the very air). He reneges on his promise, and the Lion turns a crank revealing a door. Behind it stands a bewildered man, in pajamas and pink curls in his hair, who claims to be the Wizard. He shows them the elaborate mechanical effects used to create his illusions, and tells them that he is really a balloonist from Omaha named Herman Smith who traveled to Oz by accident when his hot air balloon drifted off course. The Ozians had never seen such a sight and proclaimed him Wizard. Not wanting to disappoint them, he assumed the role and had a great city built. He then had everyone in it wear green glasses, and in time, they came to believe it was green.\n\nFurious, the group confronts the Wizard on his deceptions (\"Who Do You Think You Are?\"), but he points out that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion already have the things they seek as shown in their behavior on the journeys they have made (\"Believe In Yourself\"). They remain unconvinced, so he creates physical symbols of their desires and they are satisfied. He proposes that Dorothy can return to Kansas the way he came, and offers to pilot her in his hot air balloon. He addresses the citizens of the Emerald City in person for the first time in many years, telling them of his imminent journey (\"Y'all Got It!\"). Just as his speech reaches its climax, the balloon comes free from its moorings and rises quickly into the air, taking Dorothy's hopes of getting home with it.\n\nJust as the group despairs of finding help, Addaperle reappears in a flash of light, suggesting that Dorothy ask Glinda, the Good Witch of the South , for assistance. She transports them to Glinda's castle in the red land of the south, where they are warmly welcomed and invited to rest after their many trials (\"A Rested Body Is a Rested Mind\"). Glinda is a beautiful and gracious sorceress, surrounded by a court of her Quadlings. She tells Dorothy that the silver shoes have always had the power to take her home, but like her friends, she needed to believe in their magic and in herself before it was possible (\"If You Believe\"). She bids a tearful goodbye to her friends, and as their faces fade into the darkness, she thinks about what she has gained, lost, and learned throughout her journey through Oz (\" Home \"). Clicking her heels together three times, she finds herself transported back to Kansas in an instant. As an overjoyed Toto appears, and she runs to hug him, she knows that she is back home at last.",

The Broadway production opened on 7 November 2019.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe musical opens with Tina preparing to go on stage, as she recites a Buddhist chant, nam myoho renge kyo .\n\nIt\u2019s 1949 in Nutbush Tennessee, a young 9-year-old Anna Mae Bullock sings exuberantly at a community church gathering (\" Nutbush City Limits \"). Her mother Zelma is embarrassed at her loudness and reprimands her. Anna Mae's parents have a difficult relationship, and after being physically assaulted, Zelma walks out with her eldest daughter Alline. Anna Mae is left alone to be brought up by her grandmother, Gran Georgeanna.\n\nSome years later, Gran Georgeanna encourages Anna Mae to go to Memphis and record an album, and Anna Mae leaves to go join her mother and sister, Alline, in St. Louis (\" Don't Turn Around \"). In St. Louis, Alline gives Anna Mae a makeover and introduces her to the nightlife (\" Shake a Tail Feather \"). At a nightclub, Anna Mae sees Ike Turner and his band, the Kings of Rhythm (\" The Hunter \"). Anna Mae is encouraged to sing on stage with Ike (\"Matchbox\" (2018\u20132021)/\"Blood Run Cold\" (2021\u2013present)). Realizing her potential, Ike persuades Zelma to let Anna Mae join his band (\" It's Gonna Work Out Fine \").\n\nIke changes the name of the band to the \"Ike and Tina Turner Revue\", and gives her the stage name \"Tina Turner\". An attraction is sparked between Tina and Raymond Hill, the band's saxophonist. Although Tina enjoys performing with Ike and The Ikettes , she becomes increasingly aware of his vicious temper and possessiveness (\" A Fool in Love \"). Ike is physically violent towards her, and leaves with a female stranger. While he is gone, Raymond confesses his love for Tina, despite her attempts to end the love affair (\" Let's Stay Together \").\n\nThe band is refused accommodation at a motel because of their race, with Ike telling the band that the new civil rights haven't changed people's attitudes. As the band sleeps in the bus, Ike tells Tina about his father who was brutally assaulted for having a relationship with a white woman. In addition, Ike is resentful that his first hit in '58, \"Rocket 88\", was credited to someone else. He has Tina make a promise that she will never leave him, and asks Tina to marry him. Tina agrees, despite being pregnant with Raymond's child. As they are about to leave, two white police officers intimidate them and Ike is forced to pay them to avoid harm.\n\nRaymond finds out about the engagement, and after warning Tina about Ike, he leaves. Rhonda Graam is introduced as the band's new manager, and Tina reveals she is pregnant with Raymond's child (\" Better Be Good to Me \"). As they continue touring, Tina becomes increasingly isolated from Ike as he begins taking drugs and sleeping with other women. She continues performing with Ike and his band, even while pregnant and eventually giving birth to two children, Craig and Ronnie, and still keeps performing despite Ike's infidelities, increasing violence, and demands of Tina's health (\" I Want to Take You Higher \"). The Ikettes leave the band because of Ike's behavior, and unsuccessfully try to convince Tina to leave as well. They introduce her to a Buddhist chant nam myoho renge kyo , to help give her strength. Rhonda admits to Tina she is only staying to help protect Tina and begs Tina to leave Ike, but she refuses because of her children.\n\nIke and Tina meet with Phil Spector , who offers them a recording deal. Ike is angered when Phil wants to record Tina as a solo artist. Phil guides Tina through a song he wrote for her, and Tina begins to find her \"voice\" (\" River Deep Mountain High \"). Despite the success of her new single, Ike is dismissive of Tina's ability as a solo artist. During an argument, Ike assaults her son, Craig. Tina threatens to leave Ike, but he apologizes and begs for her forgiveness (\" Be Tender with Me Baby \"). Tina overdoses and is sent to a hospital, but is forced to check out for a performance (\" Proud Mary \"). Zelma tells Tina that she must teach Ike a lesson.\n\nTina and Ike get into another violent fight, causing Tina to run away. Bruised and bleeding, she asks a hotel clerk for a room to stay, using only her stage name as a promise to pay later since she doesn't have any money (\" I Don't Wanna Fight \").\n\n### Act II\n\nDivorced from Ike, Tina is in debt and forced to perform in Las Vegas bars with the help of Rhonda, now her manager. They're struggling to make ends meet because no record label wants to sign a black woman who's nearing forty years old, and Ike has claimed copyright over all songs from the \"Ike & Tina Revue\", preventing her from singing the songs she's known for (\" Private Dancer \").\n\nAs they drop off a demo tape at Capitol Records, they meet Roger Davies, a young Australian music producer who is a fan of Tina. Roger watches Tina perform in Las Vegas (\" Disco Inferno \"), and becomes her manager. Despite being upset about being put aside, Rhonda understands Tina needs to try something new. Tina tells Rhonda she needs her more as a sister, and Rhonda promises to stand by Tina's side (\" Open Arms \"). When Tina arrives in London, she meets Erwin Bach, who was sent to pick up Tina at the airport. Tina struggles with Roger's advice as she wants to reinvent herself. Tina feels lonely and isolated, and dreams of Ike watching her (\" I Can't Stand the Rain \"). Erwin comes to her hotel room and comforts her, and they share a kiss.\n\nWhile preparing for a showcase for the record label, Tina becomes upset at Roger's instructions and does not want to be anyone's puppet. Tina prepares her Buddhist mantra to calm herself, and has visions of her younger self and Gran Georgeanna encouraging her (\" Tonight \"). Despite the showcase's success, the record label refuses to sign Tina because of her age, gender, and race. Furious, Roger quits the label and decides to promote her himself in the United States. Erwin declares his love for her and asks her to stay in London with him, but Tina rejects him. Tina successfully performs in New York City (\" What's Love Got to Do with It? \"). Capitol Records begs her to sign with them, but Tina agrees only on her own terms.\n\nAlline arrives with news Zelma is dying. Tina visits Zelma at the hospital, who admits she struggled raising Tina. Ike also visits, and Zelma encourages them to reconcile. Tina is hurt her mother can't see Ike's abusive behavior, and Ike refuses to apologize. Tina and Alline mourn their mother (\" We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome) \"). Tina realizes she is surrounded by people who form her own version of a family.\n\nRiding high, Tina prepared for a concert in front of 180,000 people in Brazil. Roger and Tina share excitement. Erwin suddenly appears, having flown to be with her. They reconcile and share a kiss. Tina ascends the stairs for the concert (\" The Best \").\n\nEncore: Tina and her band perform a mini-concert of \"Nutbush City Limits\" and \"Proud Mary\".",

        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nJanis Sarkisian and Damian Hubbard introduce the audience to Cady Heron, breaking the fourth wall and inviting them on their journey (\"A Cautionary Tale\"). Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them. Despite this, she is ready to accept the challenge of fitting in at the high school (\"It Roars\"), only for Cady to find that no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars\" (reprise)). Janis and Damian decide to help her as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"); describing the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics\" in particular. The trio consists of Regina George, the \" Queen Bee \"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells Damian and Janis about the invitation, the latter asks her to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis interrupts him.\n\nIn AP Calculus , Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks her to join them, but Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina puts down Kevin to make him leave. Cady thinks Regina is nice for \"protecting\" her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. Amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, however, Cady does not pay attention to Janis\u2019s words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she has met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron, Gretchen becomes horrified because he is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to her friends. The Plastics and Cady retire to Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\" and Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that she and Regina used to be best friends. Regina claims Janis freaked out when she was unable to invite her to her thirteenth birthday party and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day, Aaron tells Cady that his previous relationship with Regina made him feel like he was not himself; he has sworn off of dating. Cady feigns ignorance to get closer to Aaron, and get his help with math (\"Stupid with Love\" (reprise)). Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Meanwhile, Karen explains that Halloween in high school is all about looking sexy (\"Sexy\"). Cady fails to realize this and arrives at the party in a \"scary\" costume, embarrassing herself. At the party, Gretchen tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Regina decides to flirt with and manipulate Aaron to spite Cady (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells him and Janis what happened. Damian tells Cady that the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends was that in 6th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian. When the latter was unable to deny it, her classmates bullied her until she left school. The three friends decide to work together to get revenge on Regina, starting with giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars to make her gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with football player Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' disastrous \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when she breaks one of the Plastics' arbitrary clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her out, but she insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt\" (reprise 1)).\n\n### Act Two\n\nFollowing the winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen (\"A Cautionary Tale\" (reprise)), though Damian and Janis disapprove of this. After Cady tells Janis that she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents, Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and make her stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a \"small\" party while they are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina and Cady while Mrs. George wonders why her daughter refuses to confide in her; reminiscing about the old days when Regina was a child. Concurrently, Gretchen contemplates being friends with Cady (\"What's Wrong With Me?\" (reprise)).\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. However, she becomes intoxicated and crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom, where Cady tells him the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron becomes upset and says he liked the smart and kind Cady, not her new Plastic self (\"More is Better\"). He leaves, but she chases after him and runs into Janis and Damian outside, who have come to confront her after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior, with the former throwing a picture she submitted to her art show at Cady; revealing that the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt\" (reprise 2)).\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars were the cause of her weight gain, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to it in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen, and Cady (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about him. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina; empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina gets distracted and hit by a passing school bus.\n\nThe accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. After learning Ms. Norbury was about to be fired due to the things she wrote, Cady takes full blame for the Burn Book, despite not having written the entire thing herself. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless\" (reprise)). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn extra credit and save her grade: joining the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into the Spring Fling with Aaron's help after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart before making up.\n\nCady is elected Spring Fling Queen, but after noticing how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, she breaks it into several pieces and gives them to each girl in attendance \u2013 telling them they are all \"real, and rare.\" She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").",

Everyone is anxious for the final school bell, except Ms. Darbus who is still teaching. Jason decides to ask Ms. Darbus about her favorite summer memory, much to the disgust of the rest of the class. Halfway through her speech, the final bell rings and the school goes chaotic (\"Countdown / What Time Is It?\"). Things have been smooth sailing for Troy and Gabriella since their star turn in Juliet and Romeo , but Sharpay vows to win Troy's heart this summer \u2013 by any means necessary. With all of the Wildcats desperate for cash, Troy gets a surprise phone call that work has arrived (\"What Time Is It\") (reprise).\n\nAt the Lava Springs Country Club , owned by the Evans family, Sharpay revels in her summer kingdom, surrounded by the club staff and her adoring \"Sharpettes\" (\"Fabulous\"). The celebration is cut short when not only Troy, but the entire Wildcats gang, shows up for duty. Mr. Fulton, the club manager, assigns them jobs, starting with cleaning up the kitchen (\"Work This Out\").\n\nAfter the Wildcats impress Mr. Fulton with their cleaning ability, Troy and Gabriella go onto the golf course to enjoy a picnic lunch. In the dining room, Kelsi plays a song she wrote for Troy and Gabriella. Among the Wildcats now, Troy gets swept up into the excitement of the song and agrees to sing it with them for the employee number in the talent show (\"You Are the Music in Me\"). Fulton informs Troy that he's been promoted to assistant golf pro, which comes with honorary membership status and an extreme makeover (\"Fabulous \u2013 Troy's Transformation\").\n\nDespite his previous commitment to Gabriella, Troy allows himself to be talked into singing with Sharpay at the Talent Show. In the midst of his new job and his practices with the college basketball team, Troy begins neglecting his friends. During rehearsal for Ryan and Sharpay's talent show number (\"Humuhumunukunukuapua\u2019a\"), Sharpay replaces Ryan with Troy.

The dubious Chad challenges \"dancer boy\" Ryan, who not only gets Chad to dance, but helps the Wildcats win the game (\"I Don't Dance\"). Now officially part of the team, Ryan teaches the gang a new number for the talent show with Chad and Taylor (\"Everyday \u2013 Rehearsal\").\n\nSharpay, feeling her Star Dazzle Award under siege, directs Fulton to yank the employees from the talent show. This is the last straw for Gabriella, who confronts Sharpay, quits her job, and breaks up with Troy (\"Gotta Go My Own Way\"). Immediately, the confused and heartbroken Troy looks back at his decisions while the voices of his friends ring through his head (\"Bet on It\").\n\nBackstage at the 4th of July Midsummer's Night Talent Show, Troy decides to set things straight.

        "description": "Taboo is a stage musical with a book by Mark Davies Markham (extensively rewritten for the Broadway production by Charles Busch ), lyrics by Boy George , and music by George, John Themis , Richie Stevens, and Kevan Frost .\n\nSet in an abandoned London warehouse , the show tells the story of a group of people (partly based on real people and partly fictional), some of whom had been connected to the New Romantic club scene some years earlier, culminating with the opening of the now-legendary Taboo (1985\u201387) of the title, which was the creation of Leigh Bowery , at the end of Act I. Boy George is featured as one of the club's regulars, as he was known to have been in the 1980s, and the show also focuses on George's life prior to and after achieving fame.",
        "synopsis": "### 2002 London production\n\nThe show starts with Philip Sallon introducing the audience to the New Romantics in London 's Soho district (\"Ode To Attention Seekers\").\n\nThe focus moves to the James family home in Bromley , where Billy lives with his mum, Josie, and dad, Derek, who is unemployed thanks to the new laws brought by the Thatcher era. Billy's dad disapproves of him wanting to be a photographer and, after another fight, Billy snaps and decides to move to London (\"Safe In the City\").\n\nHere, Billy runs into Sallon, who tells him he knows of a place where he can stay, squatting with a few other people (\"Gimme A Freak\"). Billy meets Kim, a punk girl who wants to be a fashion designer, and George, her housemate. Billy is fascinated by George, the two start talking and George shares that his father never approved of him, only his mother understood and loved him (\"Stranger In This World\"). George kisses Billy, taking him by surprise, Billy runs off scared.\n\nThe audience is introduced to Steve Strange , who is acting as bouncer at the local night club. Kim, Billy, Philip and George arrive at the club and Billy is fascinated by the club's patrons and begins to take pictures. Steve Strange premieres his new hit record (\" Fade To Grey \"), but the audience of the club don't appreciate hearing it again, so they pull the plug halfway through his performance. The audience is then introduced to another popular face on the New Romantic scene, Marilyn , dressed up like Marilyn Monroe (\"Genocide Peroxide\").\n\nLeigh Bowery , a fashion designer and performance artist who travelled from Australia to be a part of the New Romantic scene, is in the men's bathroom of the club. Billy enters and is amazed by Leigh's outlandish look.  Leigh is instantly attracted to the photographer (\"I'll Have You All\") and gives him his number (\"I'll Have You - Reprise\").\n\nWith time Kim and Billy become closer and start falling for each other (\"Love Is a Question Mark\"). Just when they are about to take the next step in their relationship, George comes home and makes a scene by flirting with Billy. George and Kim start to argue, which makes Billy runs off again, being sick of the fighting. Out on the street late at night, Petal is selling drugs (\"Shelter\"), Billy bumps into him and expresses his disgust at Petal and is almost attacked by him, but escapes.\n\nBilly's mom is on the phone with Kim. After the call, Kim starts to question whether Billy will still like her even if she removes all her makeup and opens up to him (\"Pretty Lies\"). Billy arrives and shares with Kim how beautiful she looks without her makeup. Kim apologizes and the conversation leads to Kim and Billy moving to the bedroom. (\"Love Is A Question Mark - Reprise\")\n\nGeorge, annoyed that Billy wants to be with Kim instead of him, joins Marilyn and heads down to Selfridges to do some shopping. George tells Marilyn that he's met a drummer who wants him to sing in his band, Culture Club . The two discuss their fantasies of being famous (\"Guttersnipe\").\n\nJosie is at home missing Billy and wondering where her life went so wrong, she doesn't love her abusive husband anymore and her life is just going in no direction (\"Talk Amongst Yourselves\"). She calls Billy and Phillip answers the phone instead. He invites Josie down to London and Josie wholeheartedly decides to go.\n\nGeorge is recording a demo with his new group and the session is stopped when the producer realises that George was singing about another man(\"The Eyes of Medusa\"). George records a different song to keep the producer happy (\" Do You Really Want To Hurt Me \"). Culture Club start to rise to fame and their single hits number 1.\n\nGeorge runs into Jayney, a journalist who now works for the Sun magazine, she is interested in George after his success and begs him for an interview. As Jane leaves, Billy bumps into her and tells her he's got some pictures of George and asks if the paper would buy them. Jane isn't interested but, she hands Billy her card if he ever has any juicy stories about George.\n\nBilly asks George if he could put a word in for him at his record company to be a photographer, but George leaves. Leigh is entering his latest creation in to a talent contest called the Miss Mud Day Queen Ball and wants Billy to model for him. (\"Guttersnipe - Reprise\") When Billy gets to Leigh's house, Leigh begins to give Billy a makeover to turn him in to a star of the New Romantic scene (\"Touched By The Hand Of Cool\"). Leigh tells Billy he will make him the talk of the town and proceeds to call everyone telling them that Billy is now one of his models and will be in the show. Rumours also start that Billy is sleeping with Leigh, which get back to Kim leaving her heartbroken (\"Church Of The Poisoned Mind\").\n\nIt's the day of the Miss Mud Day Queen Ball and Leigh's collection wins the contest, with Billy, now nicknamed Spartacus. Leigh announces he is opening a club called Taboo. Kim and Josie arrive and are shocked at what they see. Kim is outraged at the thought of Billy sleeping with Leigh and his mother is disappointed in him and the two leave Billy alone (\"Stranger In This World Reprise\").\n\nTaboo is now open and everyone who is anyone is there (\"Everything Taboo\"). Kim and Josie, who has decided to leave Billy's dad and stay with Kim in London, go to the club. Whilst there they decide to team up and create a fashion line of their own and rent a flat from Philip. Billy is now hanging out with George and Kim seeing them together, presumes that they are sleeping together. Billy tries to apologise to Kim about the Leigh Bowery incident but Kim doesn't want to hear it, so Billy tells Leigh he doesn't want to work as his model anymore in an attempt to get back with Kim. Josie tells Billy she is ashamed of him and what he's done to Kim.\n\nGeorge now deeply affected by fame has begun to take drugs with Petal and Marilyn at the club. Billy asks George if he can work at Virgin Records and be the official Boy George photographer again and George agrees.\n\nJosie and Kim are at home and their business is starting to take off, the two have also become good friends with Philip. Josie's husband, Derek, arrives and asks Josie to come back home, but she refuses. He takes an instant dislike to Philip and Kim and verbally abuses them causing Josie to kick him out (\"Independent Woman\").\n\nBack in George's apartment, he and Marilyn are having a drug binge and George's habit has gotten completely out of control. Billy enters annoyed at George after going to Virgin Records expecting a job but realizing George had not set it up. He tells George to stop using drugs or he will be risking his life (\"I See Through You\").\n\nWalking home from the shop, Philip sees Josie's husband at the bus stop. Philip tells him that Josie did the right thing ending it with him. Derek beats Philip up in the street, leaving him bruised and bloodied (\"Petrified\").\n\nLeigh's live-in helper, Sue, opens a giant curtain to reveal that Leigh has installed himself behind a sheet of glass as a work of art at an art gallery. He explains to the audience that he is art (Ich Bin Kunst). After his performance Sue tells Leigh that he needs to go to the hospital for a check up, but Leigh won't go, hinting he's scared about his HIV positive status. (\"Ich Bin Kunst - Reprise\")\n\nBilly has been to New York to photograph Marilyn's first concert to launch his debut single. When he arrives in London, he goes to see his mom, Kim, and Philip. Kim still refuses to talk to him, but Billy tells her that he can't stop thinking about her and apologizes for sleeping with George. Kim starts to come around but unfortunately all efforts are wasted as George turns up at the house and has a go at Billy for leaving him and going to New York with Marilyn. George collapses in a heap on the floor.\n\nBilly meets up with Jayney and gives her pictures of George using drugs and the full story about his addiction. He takes no money, he does it thinking that it will push George to get help. The story breaks and the media is outraged at George. (\"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me - Reprise\")\n\nGeorge is arrested for possession of drugs and the seriousness of his addiction hits him. George, Steve Strange, Marilyn and Billy all ponder how they have his rock bottom (\"Out Of Fashion\"). At the hospital Leigh lays dying of AIDS, his trusted friend Sue is the only with him when he dies (\"Il Adore\").\n\nBilly tries to stop Petal from selling drugs to a young boy and ends up in fight with him. The dealer pulls a knife on Billy but just in the nick of time George turns up to rescue him. The two talk about everything what has happened and the mistakes they have made. Billy apologizes for informing the media about George's addiction, but George tells him that Billy, revealing the story, saved his life (\"Pie In The Sky\").\n\nBilly tells George he's going to India to take some time to study with the Hare Krishners and that George should join him. So George, Billy, Philip, Kim, and Josie all go travel to India. After a few weeks the group decides to go home, after finding the answers they were looking for, but Billy decides he's going to stay a little longer (\" Bow Down Mister \"). The entire company sing (\"Karma Chameleon\") as they leave the stage.\n\n### 2003 Broadway production\n\nThe Broadway production of the show switched its focus to George, from his roots to his rise to fame with Culture Club , and Leigh Bowery, from his start until his timely death because of AIDS, removing some of the key characters of the UK production in favor of new ones. Philip Sallon and Big Sue become narrators of the story and Billy become Marcus, a sexually confused photographer who falls for George. The new figure of Nicola was introduced, based on real-life friend and later wife of Bowery, Nicola Bateman.\n\nIn an interview Boy George said that the Broadway version of the show \"brings out more of an \"emotional aspect of the characters\", going deeper in exploring the main characters of George and Leigh.",

The story is set in the Canadian Rocky Mountains and concerns Rose-Marie La Flemme, a French Canadian girl who loves miner Jim Kenyon. When Jim falls under suspicion for murder, her brother Emile plans for Rose-Marie to marry Edward Hawley, a city man.\n\nThe work premiered on Broadway at the Imperial Theatre on September 2, 1924, running for 557 performances.  It was the longest-running Broadway musical of the 1920s until it was surpassed by The Student Prince (1926). It was then produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London in 1925, enjoying another extraordinary run of 581 performances.  It was filmed in 1928, in 1936 and again in 1954.\n\nThe best-known song from the musical is \" Indian Love Call \".  It became Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy 's \" signature song \". Several other numbers have also become standards, including the title song .",
        "synopsis": "In Fond-du-Lac, Saskatchewan , Canada, trappers , hunters and travellers gather at \"Lady\" Jane's hotel (\"Vive la Canadienne\"). Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Malone is flirting with Lady Jane, while wealthy city man Edward Hawley is watching a French Canadian girl, Rose-Marie La Flamme, even though she's miner Jim Kenyon's sweetheart.  Rose-Marie's brother, Emile, is searching for her, fearing she is alone with Jim. Wanda, a half-blooded Indian , dances close to Hawley, enraging her Indian lover, Black Eagle.  Lady Jane's man, the cowardly \"Hard-Boiled Herman\", arrives at the bar.  Jim arrives to greet Rose-Marie enthusiastically and explains to Sergeant Malone that he has given up his former wild ways because of his love for \"Rose-Marie\".  Black Eagle claims some land (and the gold on it) belonging to Jim and Herman.  Herman thinks that shooting Black Eagle will solve everything, but Jim prefers to use legal means, declaring that he will visit Black Eagle and show him the boundary line the property map.  Sergent Malone and \"The Mounties\" warn Herman that they will not hesitate to enforce the laws.\n\nEmile is going to take Rose-Marie with him to the trapping grounds at Kootenay Pass .  He dislikes Jim and wants her to marry Hawley for financial security.  Rose-Marie doesn't want to go, insisting to her brother that she is in love with Jim (\"Lak Jeem\").  Hawley plans to accompany Emile, but first he has to end his affair with Wanda.  He plans to visit her at Black Eagle's log cabin and bribe her to stay away from him.  Jim tells Rose-Marie that he will follow her to Kootenay Pass, and they will meet in an old house he calls a castle near a valley with a beautiful echo.  According to legend, Indians would call down into the valley to the girls they wished to marry (\"Indian Love Call\").\n\nHawley meets Wanda at her cabin and tries to pay her off, just as Jim arrives with a map to prove his claim.  Wanda sends Jim away.  Black Eagle returns home and catches Wanda and Hawley embracing.  He attacks Hawley, and Wanda stabs Black Eagle to save Hawley.  Jim and Herman, unaware of the murder, follow Emile, Hawley, and Rose-Marie to Kootenay Pass.  Jim and Rose-Marie communicate through their \"Indian Love Call\" (reprise).  Emile tells Rose-Marie that she should marry Hawley because he could buy her all the \"Pretty Things\" she wants.  Wanda arrives at Kootenay Pass and tells everyone that Jim is wanted for the murder of Black Eagle; his map was discovered near Black Eagle's body.\n\nHerman continues romancing Lady Jane (\"Why Shouldn't We?\").  Hawley proposes to Rose-Marie, but she refuses him.  He and a city girl whom he has employed, Ethel Brander, try to impress Rose-Marie with the glamour of city life in Quebec .  Wanda leads an Indian \"Totem-Tom-Tom\" dance.  Jim has received an offer from the Brazilian government to lead a mining project there.  He asks Rose-Marie to come with him, even though it would be safer for her to go to Quebec and wait for him there.  If she decides to come, they will meet at the \"castle\" and go to the United States to be married.  If she does not, she should sing the Indian Love Call up the valley to him. Rose-Marie insists she will go with him; he leaves immediately, and she plans to follow twenty minutes later to avoid attracting suspicion.  Sergeant Malone arrives with a warrant to arrest Jim for murder.  Emile knows that Jim is hiding in the \"castle\".  He tells Rose-Marie that he will not reveal Jim's hiding place to the Mounties if she will go to Quebec and marry Hawley.  Holding back tears, Rose-Marie tells Hawley that she must sing the \"Indian Love Call\" to him, but she is really singing to Jim, telling him that she will not go with him.\n\nMany months have passed.  Rose-Marie is about to marry Hawley in Quebec, believing that Jim was the killer.  Ethel Brander has convinced her that Jim murdered Black Eagle because he loved Wanda.  Herman and Lady Jane have married, and they have a shop in Quebec.  He still flirts with other women, but he catches her giving Sergeant Malone \"Only a Kiss\".  Jim returns with Wanda intending for her to clear his name.  But, seeing Wanda, Rose-Marie jumps to conclusions about Jim and Wanda.  Rose-Marie tells Jim that she loves Hawley (\"I Love Him\").\n\nThe wedding preparations commence (\"The Minuet of the Minute\"), and Wanda jealously threatens Hawley.  Sergeant Malone prepares to arrest Jim, who is hiding in Kootenay Pass, even though Malone is troubled by the evidence.  Herman suspects Wanda and gets her to confess by pretending that Hawley has accused her of the murder.  Jane interrupts them and incorrectly assumes Herman is cheating on her (\"One Man Woman\").  The wedding begins (\"Doorway of My Dreams\"), but as Rose-Marie walks down the aisle, Wanda publicly confesses to the murder and declares her love for Hawley.  Everyone rushes to Jim's lodgings, and Rose-Marie goes to the pass to return Jim's \"Indian Love Call\".  The lovers are finally united.",

        "title": "Merrily We Roll Along (musical)",
        "description": "Merrily We Roll Along is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by George Furth . It is based on the 1934 play of the same name by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart .\n\nThe show tells the story of how three friends' lives and friendship devolve over the course of 20 years; it focuses particularly on Franklin Shepard, a talented composer of musicals who, over those 20 years, abandons his friends and songwriting career to become a producer of Hollywood movies. Like the play on which it is based, the show's story moves in reverse chronology , beginning in 1977 at the friends' lowest moment and ending in 1957, at their youthful best.\n\nMerrily premiered on Broadway on November 16, 1981, in a production directed by frequent Sondheim collaborator Hal Prince , with a cast almost exclusively of teenagers and young adults. However, the show was not the success the previous Sondheim\u2013Prince collaborations had been: after a chaotic series of preview performances, it opened to widely negative reviews, and closed after 16 performances and 44 previews.\n\nIn subsequent years, the show has been extensively rewritten and enjoyed several notable productions, including an Off-Broadway revival in 1994 and a West End premiere in 2000 that won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical . The 2022 Off-Broadway production staged at New York Theatre Workshop transferred to Broadway in fall 2023, starring Jonathan Groff , Daniel Radcliffe , and Lindsay Mendez and directed by Maria Friedman . It won four Tony Awards , including Best Revival of a Musical . A film adaptation starring Paul Mescal , Beanie Feldstein , and Ben Platt is currently in production and is being filmed over the course of 20 years, having begun in 2019.",
        "synopsis": "This is a synopsis of the current, revised version of the show since the 1994 York Theatre production, not the original one performed on Broadway in 1981. The plot revolves around Frank Shepard, a famous songwriter and eventual film producer (\"Overture/Merrily We Roll Along\"). Moving backwards across 20 years, the show details Frank's rise from a penniless dreamy-eyed composer to a wealthy film-producing sell-out , and what he lost to get there.\n\n### Act I\n\nIn 1976, the charismatic Frank Shepard hosts an opening-night party of Hollywood insiders, along with his mistress and star of his new film, Meg, who all lavishly praise him (\"That Frank\"). Frank initially seems jovial but tenses when a partygoer mentions Charley Kringas, Frank's former best friend and musical collaborator. His oldest remaining friend, theatre critic Mary Flynn, attends the party too but is disgusted by the other guests' shallowness and Frank's abandonment of music: his true talent. Becoming more and more jaded, Mary finally gives a drunken toast, castigating Frank and his guests, before storming out. Frank's wife Gussie arrives, angry that Meg landed the film role over her, and reveals she knows he is cheating on her with Meg. He admits that he has pursued financial success at the expense of his values and loved ones. Gussie viciously splashes iodine in Meg's face and declares her and Frank's marriage over.\n\nThe years roll back to 1973 (\"First Transition\"), when Frank and Charley are about to be interviewed in a New York television studio. Mary greets the bitter Charley backstage, who says Frank rarely makes time to collaborate anymore. Mary tries to soothe him by explaining she set up this interview to force Frank to publicly commit to the show the two men have been planning for years. She is nostalgic (\"Old Friends \u2013 Like It Was\"), and Charley is shocked that, even after 16 years, Mary clearly remains in love with Frank. Frank belatedly arrives with his new wife Gussie, who is trying to avoid lending money to her ex-husband: washed-up Broadway producer Joe. Frank is nervous to tell Charley that he has signed a three-picture deal, but the interviewer lets the news slip right before they go live on air, during which Charley launches into a sardonic rant on Frank's shift from music towards money, before urging the audience to keep Frank committed to his piano (\"Franklin Shepard, Inc.\"). Once the interview ends, a disgusted Frank declares Charley has betrayed him, and ends their friendship despite Charley's apology and Mary's protests.\n\nIn 1968, Mary and Charley surprise Frank in his new apartment on Central Park West (\"Second Transition\") with Frank's young son, Frankie, whom he has not seen since his contentious divorce from his first wife. Frank wants to option a film version of his and Charley's stage show Musical Husbands to pay for the divorce, but, when Charley passionately objects, Mary calms her friends' tensions (\"Old Friends\"). Frank's producer Joe and Joe's wife Gussie arrive with champagne which Mary, a teetotaler at this time, refuses. Everyone is aware that Frank and Gussie are having an affair except Mary who, appalled to now realize this, gulps down the champagne. After everyone leaves, Frank plays an old song on his piano and attempts to make sense of his choices. On the verge of composing a new piece, he is interrupted when Gussie returns, announcing that she intends to leave Joe and commit to Frank (\"Growing Up\").\n\nIn 1966 (\"Third Transition\"), Frank and his first wife Beth are fighting over custody of their son Frankie in a courthouse. Reporters flock around, eager to catch gossip since Gussie has been subpoenaed. Frank confronts Beth, who still loves him but cannot live with him knowing he was unfaithful to her with Gussie (\"Not a Day Goes By\"). Beth drags their son away, heading to Texas to live with her father. Frank collapses in despair but is consoled by Mary, Charley, and his other remaining friends who try to convince him that this is the \"best thing that ever could have happened\" (\"Now You Know\").\n\n### Act II\n\nIn 1965, Gussie is performing a song on the opening night of Musical Husbands : Frank and Charley's first Broadway show (\"Gussie's Opening Number\"). The curtain comes down on the show and, as the audience applauds, Charley and Frank, backstage with Joe, Mary, and Beth, are ecstatic to learn the show is a hit (\"It's a Hit!\"). Charley's wife is in labor, and before he and Beth rush to the hospital, Mary begs Beth to stay behind so that Frank will not be left alone with Gussie. Beth says she trusts her husband and departs.\n\nIn 1962 (\"Fourth Transition\"), Frank, Beth, Charley, and Mary have been invited to a party at Gussie and Joe's elegant Sutton Place apartment, where they stand starstruck by the influential crowd (\"The Blob\"). Deliberately spilling wine on Beth's dress, Gussie pulls Frank away from the partygoers, confiding her unhappiness to him, and convinces him to write the commercial show Joe is producing, Musical Husbands , rather than the political satire he and Charley are trying to get produced (\"Growing Up\" (Reprise)). Returning to her guests, she invites the songwriters to perform their latest song, \"Good Thing Going\". The guests love it and Gussie implores them to do an encore, but the guests quickly lose interest and resume their noisy cocktail chatter (\"The Blob\" (Reprise)). Charley storms out as Mary looks on worriedly.\n\nIn 1960 (\"Fifth Transition\"). Charley, Frank, and Beth are performing at a small nightclub in Greenwich Village, with Mary lending a hand. Trying to appear bright and sophisticated, they perform a song celebrating America's new First Family (\"Bobby and Jackie and Jack\"). Joe is in the tiny audience and is quite impressed, as is his new fianc\u00e9e and former secretary Gussie. After the show, Frank explains to them that he and Beth are marrying. It becomes clear that the wedding is due to her pregnancy, but Frank professes his happiness anyway. With Mary, Charley, and Beth's disapproving parents looking on, the happy couple exchanges vows as a lovelorn Mary tries to swallow her feelings for Frank (\"Not a Day Goes By\" (Reprise)).\n\nIn 1958 to 1959 (\"Sixth Transition\"), Frank, Charley, and Mary are busy in New York, working their way up the career ladder, taking any job they can and working feverishly on their songs, plays, and novels. Frank and Charley audition for Joe, but he wants more \"hummable\" tunes, and instructs them to leave their name with his secretary, Gussie. So they decide to do their own show and, in an ensuing montage, audition and hire Beth, forming a cabaret show together (\"Opening Doors\").\n\nIn 1957 (\"Seventh Transition\"), early one morning, college-attending Frank and Charley are on the roof of an apartment building on New York City's 110th Street, waiting to spot the first-ever Earth-orbiting satellite, Sputnik . Frank tells Charley how much he likes Charley's plays and proposes that they turn one, a political satire, into a musical. Mary, their neighbor, arrives to view the satellite, and meets the boys for the first time. She has heard Frank's piano from her apartment, and tells him how much she admires his music. He speaks of how much composing means to him. Suddenly, Sputnik appears in the sky, and now, for the young friends, anything is possible (\"Our Time\").\n\n### Differences from the original Broadway version\n\nThe original 1981 version had much the same plot as the revised version, with a few notable differences. The original version begins and ends with an actor playing an older Frank giving a cynical speech to a group of high school graduates, who play the characters in the rest of the show. At the end, he joins with his younger self in a symbol of hope. \"That Frank\" replaced a song called \"Rich and Happy\", which had a more childish view of Hollywood parties. Both instances of \"Growing Up\" were also not present, and the \"Old Friends\" scene ended with Mary drinking. \"Not a Day Goes By\" was originally sung by Frank; \"Now You Know\" and \"It's a Hit\" had different lyrics, and the ensemble was composed of a different set of characters. In the scene with \"It's a Hit\", Beth is the one who is pregnant instead of Charley's wife. There was also an additional scene, between \"Rich and Happy\" and \"Franklin Shepard, Inc.\", in which Mary attempts to bring Charley and Frank together at a restaurant to reconcile. This scene, and the song \"Like it Was\", were folded into the following scene in the revised version. Aside from these changes, the two versions are mostly the same.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nTwo houses are separated by a wall (portrayed by a mute actor) in an unspecified American town.\n\nA mysterious bandit, El Gallo, tells about the kind of September \"when love was an ember about to billow\" (\" Try to Remember \"). He begins to narrate the plot of the play. Two young people, Matt and Luisa, live next door to each other and fall in love. However, their fathers are feuding and order them not to speak to each other. Luisa fantasizes about the experiences she wants to have in her life (\"Much More\"). Matt then delivers a speech about his love for Luisa, calling over the wall to her in a mock literary/heroic way (\"Metaphor\"). Matt and Luisa climb to the top of the wall and speak secretly of Luisa's romantic vision of Matt saving her from kidnapping. Matt's father, Mr. Hucklebee, then appears and tells about his philosophy of life and gardening (don't over-water). He orders Matt to go inside the house. Luisa's father, Mr. Bellomy, arrives and gives a contrasting philosophy of life and gardening (plenty of water). He orders Luisa inside. He then calls to Hucklebee, and the two old friends boast about their cleverness in pretending to feud as a means to ensure that their children fall in love. They note that to manipulate children you need merely to say \"no\" (\"Never Say No\"). Hucklebee tells Bellomy of his plan to end the feud by having Luisa \"kidnapped\" by a professional abductor so that Matt can \"rescue\" her and appear heroic.\n\nThe hired professional, El Gallo, appears and offers the fathers a menu of different varieties of \" rape \" \u2013 in the literary sense of an abduction or kidnapping \u2013 that he can simulate (\"It Depends on What You Pay\"). Deciding to spare no expense for their beloved children (within reason), the fathers agree to a \"first class\" abduction scene. A disheveled old actor with a failing memory, Henry Albertson, arrives with his sidekick, Mortimer, a Cockney dressed as an American Indian. El Gallo engages them to help with the staged kidnapping. Matt and Luisa return to speak of their love and hint at physical intimacy (\" Soon It's Gonna Rain \"). El Gallo and the actors burst in and carry out the moonlit abduction scenario; Matt \"defeats\" the three (\"Rape Ballet\"). The feud is ended and the wall between the houses torn down, with the children and the fathers joined in a picturesque final tableau (\"Happy Ending\"). El Gallo collects the stage properties used in the \"abduction\" and wonders aloud how long the lovers and their fathers will be able to maintain their elaborately joyful poses. He and The Mute leave.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe children and fathers are discovered in the same poses but are visibly exhausted by the effort. El Gallo observes that what seemed romantic by moonlight may lose its charm when exposed to the harsh light of day. He exchanges his moon for a blazing sun. The fathers and lovers begin to complain about one another, noticing all the flaws that have become glaringly visible by daylight (\"This Plum Is Too Ripe\"). The children try to recreate their romantic mood from the previous night and mock their fathers. Eventually, in a fit of pique, Hucklebee reveals that the kidnapping and the feud were fake. Matt and Luisa are mortified, and the fathers' mutual recrimination quickly escalates into a real feud; they storm off to their respective houses. Matt sees El Gallo and, in a desperate attempt to regain his honor and Luisa's love, challenges him to a duel. El Gallo easily disarms Matt and leaves him embarrassed. Matt and Luisa then argue; she calls him a poseur, while he calls her childish.\n\nMatt is eager to leave the provincial town. He and El Gallo discuss his gleaming vision of adventure (\"I Can See It\"). Henry and Mortimer return and lead Matt off to see the world. A month passes, and the fathers have rebuilt the wall. They meet and speak sadly of their children; Luisa is like a statue and does nothing but sit and dream; Matt still hasn't returned. They then sing about the uncertainties of raising children, as compared with the reliability of vegetable gardening (\"Plant a Radish\"). Luisa sees El Gallo watching her and is intrigued by the handsome, experienced bandit. Impulsively, she asks him to take her away to see the world. In a long fantasy sequence, they preview a series of romantic adventures through a mask of unreality, while in the background Matt is being abused and beaten by Henry and Mortimer portraying a series of unpleasant exotic employers. Luisa's fantasies become increasingly frenzied, exhausting and darkly underscored (\"Round and Round\").\n\nEl Gallo tells Luisa to pack her things for the journey, but before she goes inside to do so, he asks her to give him her treasured necklace, a relic of her dead mother, as a pledge that she will return. As she goes inside, El Gallo promises her a world of beauty and grandeur; at the same time, Matt approaches, giving a contrasting version of the cruel experiences that one can suffer (\"I Can See It\" (reprise)). As Luisa disappears, El Gallo turns to leave, the injured Matt makes a pitiful attempt to stop him from hurting Luisa, but El Gallo knocks him away and disappears. Luisa returns to find that El Gallo has left with her necklace, and she sits in tears. El Gallo, as the narrator, explains poetically that he had to hurt Matt and Luisa, and also himself in the process. Matt comforts Luisa, and he tells her a little about his experiences, and the two realize that everything they wanted was each other (\"They Were You\"; \"Metaphor\" (reprise)), but that they now understand that more deeply. The Fathers return joyfully and are about to tear down the wall, when El Gallo reminds them that the wall must always remain (\"Try to Remember\" (reprise)).",

        "description": "The Who's Tommy is a rock musical with music and lyrics by Pete Townshend and a book by Townshend and Des McAnuff . It is based on the 1969 rock opera Tommy by The Who .",
        "synopsis": "Note that there are several plot differences between the album, the film, and the stage production, though the general storyline is largely the same.\n\n### Prologue\n\nAn opening montage of London is presented, beginning in 1940 with the initial meeting and then marriage of the Walkers. Amidst World War II , the husband, Captain Walker, parachutes into Germany , where he is captured as a prisoner of war by the Nazis (\"Overture\"). Back in London at 22 Heathfield Gardens, the captain's brother Ernie delivers a care package to the pregnant Mrs Walker just as two officers arrive at the home to announce the disappearance and presumed death of her husband (\"Captain Walker\").\n\n### Act I\n\nThe following year, two nurses gently hand Mrs Walker her newborn son, Tommy; later, in 1945, American troops liberate Captain Walker's POW camp, proclaiming the end of the war (\"It's a Boy\" / \"We've Won\"). Mrs Walker has since attained a new lover, and they celebrate her twenty-first birthday and discuss marriage together with four-year-old Tommy (\"Twenty-One\"). To their surprise, Captain Walker enters the house and a fight erupts between Captain Walker and the boyfriend. Mrs Walker turns Tommy away, but he watches his father shoot the boyfriend to death through a large mirror. Captain and Mrs Walker embrace but soon realize what Tommy has witnessed, and violently shake him, telling him he did not see or hear anything (\"What About the Boy\"). The police arrive; Tommy simply gazes at the mirror in silence. A narrator\u2014Tommy's older self\u2014appears to the audience, introducing and framing the story of his exceptional childhood (\" Amazing Journey \").\n\nCaptain Walker is tried for murder but found not guilty by reasons of self-defense. However, Tommy fails to celebrate his father's release, and his family quickly realizes that he has apparently gone deaf, mute, and blind. Tommy's parents have him undergo a battery of medical tests, to no avail (\"Sparks\"). At ten years of age, Tommy's unresponsive state remains unchanged (\"Amazing Journey \u2013 Reprise\"). The Walkers all go to church and host a Christmas family dinner, though the family is unnerved that Tommy does not know that it is Christmas or understand its significance (\" Christmas \"). Everyone is stunned when Tommy responds only to his uncle Ernie's playing the French horn. Mr Walker, in a desperate attempt to reach his son, shouts \"Tommy, can you hear me?\" multiple times. Older Tommy, only visible to young Tommy, who persistently stares at the mirror, sings to him (\" See Me, Feel Me \").\n\nThe Walkers leave Tommy with a slew of vicious babysitters, including alcoholic and sexually abusive Uncle Ernie (\"Do You Think It's Alright?\" and \" Fiddle About \"), as well as his cousin Kevin, a sadistic bully (\"Cousin Kevin\"). Cousin Kevin and his friends take Tommy to a youth club where, to everyone's astonishment, Tommy plays pinball brilliantly (\"Sensation\"). Meanwhile, another doctor, a psychiatrist, tests Tommy yet again with no success (\"Sparks \u2013 Reprise\"). The desperate Captain Walker is approached by The Hawker and Harmonica Player (\" Eyesight to the Blind \") who promise a miraculous cure for Tommy. They take young Tommy to the Isle of Dogs to find a prostitute called The Gypsy, who tries to convince Captain Walker to let her spend time alone with Tommy, introducing him to drugs (\" The Acid Queen \"). Horrified by her methods, Captain Walker snatches Tommy away. By 1958, Tommy has apparently become a pinball-playing expert as Cousin Kevin and a group of adolescents await 17-year-old Tommy's appearance at the amusement arcade, where his rise to local popularity has begun (\" Pinball Wizard \").\n\n### Act II\n\nBy 1960, Tommy has become the local pinball champion and hero of the neighborhood lads (\"Underture\"). Captain Walker persists unsuccessfully in seeking doctors and a cure for Tommy (\"There's a Doctor\" and \" Go to the Mirror! \"). One doctor discovers that Tommy's senses do function but not at a self-aware or openly expressive level. On the street, a group of local louts surround Tommy (\"Tommy, Can You Hear Me?\") and carry him home. The Walkers, at their wits' end, passionately confront each other in an effort to reconcile and face the reality that Tommy might never be cured (\"I Believe My Own Eyes\"). Captain Walker leaves Mrs. Walker with Tommy. Tommy stares into the mirror blankly as his mother tries desperately to reach him one last time, before smashing the mirror in a rage (\"Smash the Mirror\"). With the mirror in pieces, Tommy suddenly becomes fully lucid and interactive for the first time since the age of four, and he leaves home (\" I'm Free \"). Through 1961 to 1963, news of Tommy's miraculous regaining of full consciousness receives huge media attention (\"Miracle Cure\"), Tommy is idolized by the public and the press (\"Sensation \u2013 Reprise\"), and he begins appearing in packed stadiums, playing pinball with a helmet that temporarily blinds and deafens him (\"Pinball Wizard \u2013 Reprise\"). Uncle Ernie tries to capitalise on Tommy's newfound stardom, by selling cheap souvenirs for a grand opening party of Tommy's new holiday camp , resulting from Tommy's cult-like following (\"Tommy's Holiday Camp\"). That night, an adolescent fan named Sally Simpson falls from the stage in her eagerness to touch Tommy and is pummeled by guards (\"Sally Simpson\"). Tommy, in horror, stops the show and tends to Sally. He says he has had enough and decides to go home.\n\nRealizing how caught up in celebrity he has become, Tommy wishes to do something in return for his fans and invites them all back to his house (\"Welcome\"). Once there, the population of fans keeps growing, though Tommy generously, but na\u00efvely, wishes to welcome everyone equally. Sally then asks Tommy how she can be more like him and less like herself (\"Sally Simpson's Question\"). He is confused, and insists that there is no reason for anyone to be like him, when everyone else already possesses the amazing gifts that he was deprived of most of his life. He suddenly realises that he had thought his fame came from his miraculous recovery, when it in fact arose due to his fans' desire for a spiritual leader , hoping he could communicate wisdom from his experience of not being able to hear, see, or talk for so long. Now, disenchanted with their hero for failing to provide the answers they wanted to be told to them, the crowd turns on him in anger and eventually leaves (\"We're Not Gonna Take It\"), leaving Tommy with just his family surrounding him. Tommy hears the voice of his ten-year-old self from the mirror (\"See Me, Feel Me\") and for a moment, to the horror of his family, seems to be reverting to his old state. Instead, he turns to his family, whom he has ignored during his stardom, and embraces them in acceptance, before he climactically reunites with his younger selves onstage (\"Listening to You/Finale\").\n\n### Plot differences between the three versions\n\nThe original 1969 album was much more ambiguous in its specific plot points than the stage musical and film versions.  Originally, the song \"Twenty-One\" was called \"1921\" as the album version took place in a post- World War I setting.  In the film, the story was changed to be post-World War II and the song was changed to \"1951\".  In both the album and stage versions, the father comes home and kills the lover in the confrontation.  Ken Russell's film made a reversal and killed Mr. Walker's character, having the lover then assume the role of a step-father to Tommy.\n\nPete Townshend made a number of lyrical changes to songs for the film version, many of which were utilized in the stage musical (these include revisions made to \"It's a Boy\", \"Amazing Journey\", and \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\", among others). The new pieces created for the film, however (\"Bernie's Holiday Camp\", \"Champagne\", \"Mother and Son\"), were not retained for the stage production.  Instead, Townshend wrote a new piece called \"I Believe My Own Eyes\" in which the Walkers resign themselves to accepting Tommy's fate after years of trying.\n\nTommy's experience with the Acid Queen (Scene 11) is also handled differently between the album, movie, and stage productions. In both the album and movie, Tommy appears to have taken a drug from the Acid Queen which produced a visceral response in the otherwise mostly catatonic child.  In the musical, his father brings him to see the Acid Queen, then changes his mind and leaves before Tommy partakes of her \"charms\".\n\nThe most fundamental difference in the story is the finale, which was rewritten in 1993.  Originally, Tommy instructs his followers to become deaf, mute, and blind themselves to find a heightened state of enlightenment.  The crowd rejects this and turns on him.  In the stage version, Tommy tells them the opposite: to not try to emulate him, but to rather live out their own normal lives.  Upon hearing this message, the crowd still rejects him out of a desire to hear a bolder message from him.",

        "synopsis": "Act I It's 1927, in the midst of a riotous bachelor party for the oft-married Jimmy Winter (\" Sweet and Lowdown \"). Outside, a trio of bootleggers \u2013 Cookie, Billie and Duke \u2013 are trying to figure out where to hide the 400 cases of gin they have stashed on their boat. As a stranger approaches, Duke and Cookie rush off. A drunken Jimmy staggers and comes across the pants-wearing Billie and is immediately smitten. He explains his plight \u2013 he must marry someone respectable or his mother will disinherit him, so he's marrying someone he doesn't truly love. Billie isn't all that interested in his tale of woe, until he reveals that he has a huge Long Island beach house that he never uses, so she swipes his wallet to discover the address. Jimmy assumes Billie is falling for him, but Billie insists that love is for suckers. Jimmy vehemently disagrees (\" Nice Work If You Can Get It \"). Jimmy passes out, and Billie focuses on this interesting man unconscious on the ground before her (\"Nice Work If You Can Get It - Reprise\"). Cookie and Duke rush back on, and Billie tells them that she found a place to store their bootleg \u2013 a Long Island beach house. A police whistle pierces the air, and the bootleggers scatter. Senator Max Evergreen and Chief Berry enter, along with Duchess Estonia Dulworth, who has brought along her Vice Squad and vows to rid society of its greatest evil (\"Demon Rum\").\n\nThe next morning, Billie, Cookie and Duke have stored their 400 cases of gin in the cellar of Jimmy's ritzy beach house. Eileen Evergreen, the finest interpreter of modern dance in the world, enters with Jimmy. They were married that morning, and they are on their honeymoon, though Eileen has yet to allow Jimmy to touch her. Cookie, disguised as a butler, enters and they naturally assume he's their servant. They send him off, and Eileen tells Jimmy that she's ready for the honeymoon shenanigans to begin \u2013 as soon as she takes a bath. She exits into the house as Billie enters, stunned to see Jimmy. Jimmy has no memory of meeting her last night, and as Jimmy flirts with her, Billie confesses that she's never been kissed. Strictly for educational purposes, Jimmy kisses Billie, and she realizes what she's been missing (\" Someone to Watch Over Me \").\n\nFour and a half hours later, Eileen is still bathing (\"Delishious\"). In the ritzy living room, Cookie and Billie devise a plan for Billie to distract Jimmy from the 400 cases of gin in his cellar. Billie runs off as Jimmy enters, followed by a gaggle of chorus girls who invite him for a group swim, which Jimmy almost accepts (\"I've Got to be There\"). Eileen enters with a flourish, and just as she is about to let Jimmy touch her, he receives a telegram revealing that his last wife has refused to sign the annulment, and an irate Eileen storms off to get her father. That night in Jimmy's ritzy bedroom, Billie breaks in and tries to seduce him, badly (\" Treat Me Rough \"). Chief Berry, who has been pursuing Billie, barges in to arrest her. But Jimmy convinces him that Billie is actually his newest wife (\" Let's Call the Whole Thing Off \") and Billie and Jimmy are forced to spend the whole night together in his bedroom.\n\nThe next morning, Jeannie, a happy-go-lucky chorus girl, comes upon Duke, a lug from New Jersey, and mistakes him for an actual English Duke. Duke, who is perpetually nervous around women, tries to escape, but Jeannie does everything in her power to  get him to notice her (\"Do it Again\").\n\nIn the ritzy living room, Jimmy and Billie realize that they are hopelessly in love (\" 'S Wonderful \") But Eileen returns with her father \u2013 the ultra-conservative Senator Evergreen \u2013 and her aunt \u2013 the Duchess  Estonia Dulworth \u2013 to demand that Jimmy and Eileen have a legal wedding. Jimmy has no choice but to marry Eileen, and Billie pretends to be a cockney maid so she can stick around and guard the bootleg. As Eileen beelines towards the cellar to get the wedding china, Jimmy and Cookie frantically distract the wedding party away from the basement (\" Fascinating Rhythm \") as the curtain falls.\n\nAct II On the ritzy terrace, the Vice Squad and Chorus Girls revel (\" Lady Be Good \"). Billie enters and realizes she'll never be as happy as the dancing revelers around her (\" But Not For Me \"). Cookie and Duke enter and, since they're all now disguised as servants, they plot how they can get the impending wedding luncheon over and done with as quickly as possible. The Duchess barrels on to instruct Cookie in the finer points of luncheon preparation. She insists on hiring a string quartet for entertainment, but Cookie has other ideas (\"By Strauss\" / \"Sweet and Lowdown - Reprise\").\n\nAs Billie sets the ritzy luncheon table, Jimmy makes one last attempt to appease her (\"Do, Do, Do\"). But Billie will have none of it. As the luncheon begins, Cookie and Duke frantically serve the luncheon guests, and the Duchess continues to annoy Cookie, who spikes her lemonade with Gin. Billie entertains them all with a cockney song (\"Hangin' Around With You\") which mainly serves as an excuse to keep pouring hot soup on Jimmy's lap. But Billie accidentally pours some steaming soup onto Eileen, who immediately fires her. The Duchess, now happily drunk, defends Billie and reveals a deep secret as she grabs onto Cookie, climbs on the luncheon table and swings from a chandelier (\"Looking for a Boy\"). After he drags off the Duchess, an angry Jimmy calls Billie a common criminal, and they realize that they can never be together. Jimmy goes to prepare for his wedding, as Jeannie enters looking for Duke, who Billie accidentally reveals isn't a real duke. Jeannie is furious, so Duke tries to win her over with a poem (\"Blah Blah Blah\"), but Jeannie rushes away.\n\nIn the ritzy bedroom, Cookie is dressing Jimmy for his wedding as Billie enters to return his wallet. Jimmy and Billie both realize that this is the last time they'll ever see each other (\"Will You Remember Me?\").\n\nThe Chorus Girls and Vice Squad set up the wedding (\"I've Got To Be There - Reprise\"). As Senator Evergreen presides, Eileen makes her very grand entrance (\" I've Got a Crush on You \"). But just before vows are exchanged, Cookie and Duke rush in, pretending to be Prohibition Agents, though Chief Berry  quickly enters and reveals their true identities. As they're arrested, Jeannie rushes in and proclaims her love for Duke, then the now sober Duchess proclaims her love for Cookie. Still, Senator Evergreen insists the bootleggers must be arrested, but Jimmy's mother, Millicent, makes an appearance, revealing the true nature of her son's heritage \u2013 Senator Evergreen is Jimmy's father. The senator proclaims the day a joyous one and all are free to pursue their new and surprising loves. Jimmy realizes that Billie has rushed to the boathouse to sail away forever, and he rushes to swear his devotion to her. Millicent follows and reveals that she happens to be the biggest rum-runner on Long Island, and she'd like Billie to marry her son and take over her business. Billie happily accepts (\"Someone to Watch Over Me - Reprise\"). And on the ritzy terrace under a starry night, love has blossomed, the bootleg is opened and the company celebrates their newfound joy (\"They All Laughed!\").",

The story follows a hapless florist shop worker who raises a plant that feeds on human blood and flesh. The musical is loosely based on the low-budget 1960 black comedy film The Little Shop of Horrors . Menken's score features early 1960s-style rock and roll , doo-wop and early Motown .\n\nThe musical premiered off-off-Broadway in 1982 before moving to the Orpheum Theatre off-Broadway , where it had a five-year run. It later received numerous productions in the U.S. and abroad, and a subsequent Broadway production. In part because of its small cast, it has become popular with school and other amateur theatre groups. The musical was also made into a 1986 film of the same name , directed by Frank Oz .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nA trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronnette and Chiffon set the scene (\"Little Shop of Horrors\") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban skid row . Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards tackiness. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (\"Skid Row (Downtown)\"). They are co-workers at a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. After a sudden eclipse of the sun, Seymour finds a mysterious plant that looks like a large Venus flytrap (\"Da-Doo\"). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.\n\nThe plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying, though Seymour takes very good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (\"Grow For Me\"). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction at the flower shop and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (\"Ya Never Know\"), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners and plastic on the furniture (\"Somewhere That's Green\").\n\nMeanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (\"Closed for Renovation\"). Audrey's abusive boyfriend, Orin Scrivello, a sadistic dentist (\"Dentist!\"), encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business (\"Mushnik and Son\"). Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik treats him poorly (\"Sudden Changes\"). When Seymour, running out of blood, stops feeding the plant, Audrey II demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true (\"Feed Me (Git It)\").\n\nSeymour sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him for his cruel treatment of Audrey. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on nitrous oxide , the gas device is stuck in the \"on\" position, and he suffocates while asking Seymour to save him. Though Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin, he lets him die of asphyxiation (\"Now (It's Just The Gas)\"). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (\"Call Back in the Morning\"). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because secretly she wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (\"Suddenly, Seymour\").\n\nBefore they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey. Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money and screams as he is devoured (\"Suppertime\"). Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible, but he does nothing over fear that Audrey will no longer love him if he is not successful (\"The Meek Shall Inherit\").\n\nAs Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood. Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from \"visiting his sick sister\". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and resolves that\nfollowing an upcoming LIFE magazine interview at the shop, Audrey II must die. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.\n\nThat night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him. He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water it. Not sensing the danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (\" Sominex /Suppertime II\"). Seymour arrives and pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded. Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (\"Somewhere That's Green\" (reprise)).\n\nThe next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to sell leaf cuttings of Audrey II in florist shops across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: world conquest. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill. Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a machete planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten (\"Bigger Than Hula-hoops\"). Patrick, Crystal, Ronnette and Chiffon search for Seymour. Not finding him, Patrick tells the girls to take the cuttings.\n\nCrystal, Ronnette and Chiffon relate that, following these events, other plants appeared across America, tricking innocent people into feeding them blood in exchange for fame and fortune. Audrey II, bigger than ever, appears with opened new flowers revealing the faces of Seymour, Audrey, Mushnik and Orin, who beg that the plants must not be fed (\"Finale Ultimo: Don't Feed the Plants\"). Audrey II slithers towards the audience threateningly.",

Eddie decides that Deloris needs to go into the witness protection program and sends her to the place he believes Shank will never find her - a convent called The Holy Order of the Little Sisters of Our Mother of Perpetual Faith.\n\nDeloris is disappointed by this idea as she learns from the Mother superior that contact with the outside world is limited, and that she cannot smoke, drink, or wear any of her less than appropriate clothing (\"Here Within These Walls\"). Deloris joins the other nuns for dinner and after several comedic interactions with the overly perky Sister Mary Patrick, Deloris discovers how the other nuns got their \"calling\" from the Lord (\"How I Got the Calling\"). They then ask Deloris to share her story with them and she lies.\n\nMeanwhile, back in his nightclub, Shank is frustrated that he cannot find Deloris anywhere. He tells his goons how he will not stop until he finds and kills Deloris (\"When I Find My Baby\"). Back at the convent Deloris is bored by the simple life of the nuns and decides to hit the town. She goes across the street to a slinky bar, and is followed by Sister Mary Lazarus, Sister Mary Patrick, and Sister Mary Robert. When the three nuns arrive they are shocked to find Sister Mary Clarence (Deloris' undercover name) drinking and dancing, however they assume that she is attempting to save the lost souls in the bar. Deloris goes along with this idea and gets the whole bar dancing (\"Do the Sacred Mass\"). However, the joyful mood is quickly destroyed when Deloris recognises Shank's boys entering the bar. She tries to hide herself as they ask people in the bar if they've seen Deloris. Suddenly there is a fight in the bar which has to be broken up by Eddie and the Mother superior, who orders the nuns to go back to the convent. She then confronts Deloris telling her that she must conform to the life of the nuns.  Eddie agrees, telling Deloris that Shank has upped the price on her head, so she needs to be careful. Deloris storms back to the convent after being informed that she has to wake up at 5 a.m. and join the choir. Eddie, now alone with only the drunks and homeless on the street, sings of his desire to be cool, to let go, and impress Deloris (\"I Could Be That Guy\").\n\nThe following morning Deloris attends the choir practice and loudly admits that the choir sounds terrible. This prompts the Mother superior to let Deloris lead the choir. Deloris does so and teaches the nuns how to sing on key and on time. She also manages to break the quiet and timid Sister Mary Robert out of her shell (\"Raise Your Voice\"). That Sunday, the choir perform an up-tempo hymn (\"Take Me to Heaven (Reprise)\") which to the struggling church's surprise brings in more people and more donations. The Mother superior, however, is horrified how the simple traditional choir she knew has changed and become modern.  The news of the choir soon spreads with photographers and news reporters coming in to get the story behind the latest sensation - this wonderful nontraditional choir.\n\nOver the coming weeks, the choir has become incredibly successful and the money from donations has paid for the church to be remodelled and fixed (\"Sunday Morning Fever\"). However, the newfound fame comes at a price. Shank and his goons spot Deloris with the choir in the newspaper. Shank orders his boys to get into the convent and bring Deloris to him. TJ, Bones, and Dinero discuss how they will do this (\"Lady in the Long Black Dress\"). Meanwhile, back at the church, Monsignor Howard has some terrific news: the choir has been asked to perform a special concert in front of the Pope. The choir are overjoyed but nervous and that night they ask Deloris to pray for their success (\"Bless Our Show\"). Deloris is also looking forward to the occasion, although the Mother superior calls her over and tells her that Shank's men have just come looking for her and she must leave quickly. The other nuns overhear and Deloris is forced to tell them the truth about who she really is and that she cannot perform with them. Deloris quickly runs off to get her things followed by Sister Mary Robert while the other nuns disappointedly go back to their rooms. Alone in Deloris' room, the Mother superior expresses joy that life can go back to being as it was. However it is evident that she, along with the other nuns, have developed a love for Sister Mary Clarence and her modern if somewhat unorthodox ways (\"Here Within These Walls (Reprise)\").\n\nAs Deloris prepares to leave Sister Mary Robert begs to come with her, claiming that she has been inspired to become a stronger person and go after the things she wants (\"The Life I Never Led\"). Deloris tells her that she doesn't need her to do that, and that she can do it all herself if she really wants to. Deloris runs from the convent and stays at Eddie's house for the night. While there she initially is overjoyed that the following day she will testify against Shank and his boys and then go back to pursuing the career she's dreamed of (\"Fabulous, Baby! (Reprise)\"). Guilty for abandoning her sisters when they needed her, she reflects on her life and realises that the choices she is making will leave her with nothing but fame and money, and when the lights go out she will be alone. She decides to return to the convent and sing with her sisters (\"Sister Act\").\n\nMeanwhile, Shank thinks up a new way to get into the convent (\"When I Find My Baby (Reprise)\"). Dressed as nuns, Shank and his boys sneak into the convent; they find and chase Deloris. Sister Mary Patrick, who has seen what has happened, informs the other nuns who insist they must go and help Deloris. The Mother superior, however, is adamant that they stay and call the police, prompting an outburst from Sister Mary Robert who tells her that she won't be quiet and take orders blindly anymore; that she is going to help Deloris (\"The Life I Never Led (Reprise)\"). The other nuns agree and all of them go running through the convent looking for Deloris. It all comes down to a final confrontation in which Shank, armed and dangerous, tells Deloris to get on her knees and beg for her life. However, all the sisters and nuns stand in front of her telling Shank that they will have to go through them first (\"Sister Act (Reprise)\"). Shank is about to start firing at the nuns when Eddie comes in and fights Shank off. He arrests Shank and his boys and then asks Deloris out on a date which she accepts. The Mother superior and Deloris come to a truce and accept that perhaps they are not so different after all. The show ends with all the nuns and eventually the entire cast performing for the Pope (\"Spread the Love Around\").\n\n### Broadway\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Deloris Van Cartier is performing for her gangster boyfriend Curtis Jackson in the night club he owns (\"Take Me to Heaven\"). Deloris is overjoyed as she believes her boyfriend is going to introduce her to a record producer on that day, although she soon learns that this is not to be. Jackson tells her he cannot join her for Christmas Day, but gives her a coat, which she discovers belonged to his wife. Hurt and frustrated, Deloris sings to her backup singers, Michelle and Tina, about her dreams of stardom and fame (\"Fabulous, Baby!\"). She decides to break up with Jackson to fulfill her dreams on her own, but gets to him just in time to see him and his crew shoot Ernie, who they believe has \"squealed\" about them to the cops.\n\nHorrified, Deloris runs to a police station and tells the desk chief, Eddie, about what happened. Eddie decides that Deloris needs to go into the witness protection program and sends her to the place he believes Jackson will never find her - a convent. When she arrives, Deloris is upset to learn from the Mother superior that contact with the outside world is limited, and that she cannot smoke, drink, or wear any of her own clothing (\"Here Within These Walls\"). Deloris, introduced as \"Sister Mary Clarence,\" joins the other nuns for dinner and discovers just how much is limited when she is a nun (\"It\u2019s Good to Be A Nun\"). Deloris asks them about what they are missing, and the Mother superior makes Deloris go on a fast.\n\nBack in his nightclub, Jackson is frustrated that he cannot find Deloris anywhere. He tells his \"crew,\" Joey, TJ, and Pablo, how he will not stop until he finds and kills Deloris (\"When I Find My Baby\"). Deloris, hungry from the fast, leaves the convent and goes to a bar across the street, where Joey, TJ, and Pablo are eating. She is followed by two nuns, Sister Mary Patrick and Sister Mary Robert, who realize what life is like outside the convent. Joey almost recognizes Deloris when he gives her money for the jukebox, but dismisses it. When a drag queen enters in a similar outfit to Deloris' opening costume, Joey, TJ, and Pablo try to stop her and get into a fight, giving Deloris, Sister Mary Patrick, and Sister Mary Robert a chance to escape.\n\nAt the convent, Eddie confronts Deloris, telling her that she needs to be more careful, and the Mother superior informs her that she join the choir the following day. Deloris storms off, and Eddie, now alone with only the drunks and homeless on the street, sings of his desire to be cool, to let go, and impress Deloris (\"I Could Be That Guy\").\n\nThe following morning Deloris attends the choir practice and, upon realizing how bad they are, offers to help them. She replaces Sister Mary Lazarus, an older and crankier nun, as their leader, and teaches the nuns how to sing in key and in time (\"Raise Your Voice\"). That Sunday, the choir perform an up-tempo hymn (\"Take Me to Heaven (Reprise)\") which brings in more people and more donations but leaves the Mother superior disgusted.\n\nThe Mother superior wants to get rid of Deloris, but Monsignor O\u2019Hara tells her that the men who were planning to buy the church love the choir, and have given their money to improve and keep the church. Over the coming weeks, the choir has become incredibly successful and the money from donations has paid for the church to be remodeled and fixed (\"Sunday Morning Fever\"). Monsignor O\u2019Hara has some terrific news: the choir has been asked to perform a special concert in front of the Pope. However, Jackson and his goons spot Deloris with the choir on the television. Jackson orders his boys to get into the convent and bring Deloris to him. TJ, Joey, and Pablo discuss how they will do this (\"Lady in the Long Black Dress\").\n\nThat night, the Mother superior asks God why He has given her the challenge that is Deloris (\u201cHaven\u2019t Got A Prayer\"), and shortly after, receives a call from Eddie. Meanwhile, Deloris is approached by the Nuns before they go to sleep, asking her to lead them praying for their show for the Pope, which is the following day (\u201cBless the Show\u201d). The Mother superior arrives and tells Deloris that the court date for Jackson has moved up to the next day and she must leave immediately. The other nuns overhear and Deloris is forced to tell them the truth about who she really is and that she cannot perform with them.\n\nAs Deloris prepares to leave, Sister Mary Robert begs to come with her, claiming that she has been inspired to become a stronger person and go after the things she wants (\"The Life I Never Led\"). Deloris, staying at Eddie's house for the night, is initially overjoyed that she will be able to go back to pursuing the career she's dreamed of after testifying against Jackson (\"Fabulous, Baby! (Reprise)\"). However, she realizes that her sisters are more important than any fame or money, and decides to return to the convent to sing with them (\"Sister Act\").\n\nMeanwhile, Jackson thinks up a new way to get into the convent, giving Joey, TJ, and Pablo nun costumes (\"When I Find My Baby (Reprise)\"). Deloris interrupts a choir rehearsal and is told by the Mother superior that she is endangering the lives of the nuns and that she must leave. Sister Mary Robert stands with Deloris (\"The Life I Never Led (Reprise)\"), but is interrupted by Curtis and his men breaking into the church. The nuns scatter and are able to take down Joey, TJ, and Pablo, but Jackson enters and traps Sister Mary Robert at gunpoint.\n\nDeloris begs Jackson to kill her instead, but the Mother superior and all the other nuns stand between them (\"Sister Act (Reprise)\"). Jackson is about to start firing at the nuns when Eddie enters and  arrests Jackson and his boys. He and Deloris share a kiss. The Mother superior and Deloris come to a truce and accept that perhaps they are not so different after all, and the entire company performs for the Pope (\"Spread the Love Around\").",

The musical was directed by Barbarino. The story concerns Bavaria's \"Mad King\" Ludwig II of Bavaria , who came to power in 1864 at the age of 18, lost a war against Prussia and spent his kingdom's fortune and sovereignty, and accumulated debts, to build extravagant castles and palaces and to sponsor Richard Wagner and other artists.

The show is a dramatization of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart beginning from the age of 17 and culminating with his death in 1791 at the age of 35. It uses both original pop-rock compositions as well as pre-existing music composed by Mozart and other composers, including Antonio Salieri.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe show opens with the accession of Hieronymus von Colloredo-Mannsfeld to the archbishop of Salzburg. Unlike the previous ruler, Colloredo is discouraging of the arts, which does not bode well for the Mozart family , who work for him. When Leopold Mozart requests leave to tour with his seventeen-year-old son and musical prodigy, Wolfgang , Colloredo refuses and suggests Leopold and Wolfgang quit if they are dissatisfied. Leopold and his daughter, Wolfgang's older sister, Nannerl , bemoan the state of Salzburg and its subservient people ( Penser l'Impossible ). Wolfgang appears, tumbling out from under the skirts of several women he's been chasing, and proceeds to be told exactly what Colloredo told Leopold: His leave has been denied.\n\nWolfgang insists that he'll leave Salzburg alone if he has to, as Leopold must stay behind because they cannot afford to be without work. Instead, Leopold sends Wolfgang's mother, Anna Maria , with him, as well as a warning: to find work fast, because a musician without a patron is no one. Anna Maria and Wolfgang set out for Mannheim , unaware that Colloredo has already sent word ahead to the Prince to assure that Wolfgang will not find work with him.\n\nThe show moves ahead to an inn in Mannheim ( La chanson de l'aubergiste ), where Wolfgang enters with several finished commissions. After sharing his dream of writing a grand opera in German, he is ridiculed by several of the people in the bar who remind him that all operas are written in Italian. Wolfgang rejects their comments ( Le Trublion ) and a fight breaks out, during which both he and his mother flee before being arrested by the police. A local copyist meets them, already aware of Wolfgang's musical prestige, and offers to copy all of his compositions free and help him distribute them for a small condition \u2013 coming to visit his family.\n\nThe copyist is Fridolin Weber \u2013 Cecilia's husband \u2013 and they intend to have Wolfgang help them prepare their daughter, Aloysia , for a ball for the Princess of Orange to boost her fame. Anna Maria and Wolfgang visit the Webers at their home, where Wolfgang is introduced to Sophie , Josepha , and Constanze . Upon the appearance of Aloysia ( Bim Bam Boum ), Wolfgang falls head over heels and forgoes his other commissions to help her prepare for her showcase to the Princess. He and the other members of the Weber family are unaware that Constanze has already started to fall in love with the young composer ( Ah! Vous dirais-je maman ).\n\nAnna Maria, seeing that her son is prepared to throw away his musical career over his love of Aloysia, writes home to Leopold in the hopes that he will be able to snap Wolfgang out of his enamored state. She attempts to do this by telling Wolfgang that his commissions have been dropped and he's been rejected for employment, but Wolfgang insists that Aloysia is his future and displays no worry.\n\nAt the ball, Wolfgang and Aloysia display their respective musical talents, while Fridolin and Cecila attempt to get the Princess of Orange to take an interest in their daughter. While Wolfgang discusses music with the Princess, Aloysia discovers Constanze's jealousy over her relationship with Wolfgang ( Six pieds sous terre ). Wolfgang returns to announce that Aloysia will, indeed, be employed with the Princess of Orange and seems prepared to dedicate his life to her when Anna Maria arrives with a letter from Leopold ( J'accuse mon p\u00e8re ). He instructs Wolfgang to go to Paris to find work, and only then may he return to Aloysia. Aloysia, who intended to work with Wolfgang to bolster her success, proclaims that she hates him in response to Wolfgang's confession of love (something that Wolfgang does not hear).\n\nAfter arriving in Paris, Wolfgang attempts to distribute his music and find a job ( Tatoue-moi ), but finds that Paris's doors have closed to him as well. When his mother suddenly falls ill and passes away ( la Procession ), he is left alone and jobless. In this state he imagines a grand and mocking display ( la Mascarade ) before Aloysia appears again. Still in love with her, he tells her that he has written an aria for her, which she ignores. She tells him that she is involved in the opera now, and far too busy for him. With lingering hatred she mocks his mourning clothes, seeming unaffected by the death of his mother, and when Wolfgang confesses that he wants to marry her she tells him that she is engaged to the actor Joseph Lange .\n\nRealizing how alone he is, and that all doors have closed to him, Wolfgang reflects on the humiliation, betrayal, and suffering he has gone through ( Je dors sur des roses ). Seeming defeated by his losses and hopelessness, Wolfgang rejects everyone who has attempted to bring him down and decides he will believe in his old dreams and aspirations, regardless of who or what stands in his way.\n\n### Act II\n\nWolfgang has returned to Salzburg under the service of Colloredo and is preparing to leave for Vienna with the archbishop to pay homage to the newly crowned Joseph II . He tells his father that he plans to make a new life for himself in Vienna, which his father scoffs at, reminding him that his previous carelessness resulted in the death of his mother. He instructs Wolfgang to do as the archbishop tells him and return to Salzburg when he's done, but Wolfgang insists that he'll do what he has to as it's his life, and his music.\n\nAfter leaving the company of his father, he is confronted by Colloredo, who reiterates his father's message of doing as he's told. When Wolfgang attempts to reason with him, Colloredo will hear nothing of it and tells him to go join the other servants \u2013 who proceed to mock him alongside a clown-like representation of his own doubt ( Com\u00e9die-trag\u00e9die ). The badgering mounts to a crescendo and he informs Colloredo that he quits and he is free to do as he pleases from now on. He proceeds to pass out his music throughout all of Vienna, where it is well received, and he finally begins to make a name for himself ( Place je passe ).\n\nThe scene moves to Antonio Salieri , walking with Rosenberg, the Steward to Emperor Joseph II, and Gottlieb Stephanie , a librettist who has recently finished his piece The Abduction from the Seraglio . Rosenberg tells Salieri of the newcomer, Wolfgang, and his aspirations of composing a German opera, which Rosenberg then proceeds to mock for its lack of eloquence. Upon the appearance of the Emperor, Rosenberg attempts to discourage him from choosing Wolfgang as the composer for his commission on the basis of his desire to use German instead of the more traditional Italian.\n\nRosenberg explains that Wolfgang insists on writing in nothing other than German, though the idea of an opera in Vienna's native language appeals to the Emperor. He asks for the opinion of Salieri, already a well-known composer of the court, who appears to agree with the idea that Wolfgang is foolish, but also concedes that he is infinitely talented. In the end, Joseph decides that Mozart will do the music for their opera, much to the glee of Stephanie and the disdain of Rosenberg.\n\nAt the height of his dispute with Colloredo, Wolfgang takes up board with the Webers, who have moved to Vienna after the death of Fridolin and are taking in boarders to make ends meet. It is here he is re-introduced to Constanze, who has apparently decided to give up on love as she puts far too much into her relationships and is left heartbroken when they do not work out ( Si je d\u00e9faille ). While Josepha and Sophie are excited to see him again, Cecilia is less than pleased with how he left Aloysia. Though she happily tells him that Aloysia's now married, doing well, and expecting a child. She also tells him that she doesn't want Wolfgang getting any ideas about her other daughters (or her, for that matter). After she leaves, Josepha and Sophie bombard him with questions about his newfound success in Vienna until Constanze intervenes and leads him to his room to get some rest.\n\nMoving ahead, it has come time for Salieri and Rosenberg to check on the progress Wolfgang has made with his opera. When they arrive, Monsieur Stephanie attempts to dissuade them, but they press on anyway and discover that Wolfgang is distracted from his work, instead chasing Constanze and demanding a kiss. Rosenberg is appalled by the display while Monsieur Stephanie attempts to get Wolfgang's attention. Wolfgang ignores him, and the diva, La Cavalieri , goes so far so to tease the latter with a kiss when she attempts to get him to focus.\n\nIt is ultimately Salieri who gets his attention with a simple recitation of his name. He explains that they are there on behalf of the Emperor and, by what they've seen, he will be disappointed. Annoyed at the treatment, Wolfgang demands to know how they can judge without hearing a single note, to which Rosenberg replies that there are too many notes. After a brief argument, Rosenberg tells Salieri that they're leaving and exits. Salieri, believing Wolfgang's behavior was a display to prevent them from discovering how little he's achieved, commends him for the clever plot. He remarks that he hopes Wolfgang's apparent confidence is not a front for a lack of real talent.\n\nHowever, before he can go, Wolfgang passes him his sheet music, saying that he would not need it as he begins to conduct. Salieri stays behind to listen and is overcome by the beauty of Wolfgang's work and the skill he displays ( Le bien qui fait mal ). Startled and unnerved by the immeasurable talent, Salieri tells Wolfgang that if he remembers his place, all will be well between them. Salieri leaves and, pleased with his victory, Wolfgang returns to his game with Constanze. Unfortunately for the young lovers, Cecilia catches them and explains that she has had an agreement written up (a \"promesse de mariage,\" in French, or \"promise of marriage\"): If Wolfgang does not marry Constanze within three years, he will have to pay Cecilia 300 florins. With no way out, Wolfgang signs the agreement despite knowing his father will not approve, and Constanze, upset with her mother's trap, runs off.\n\nBack in Salzburg, Nannerl reads the news to her father that Wolfgang is doing well in Vienna and has a promising career of fame and fortune ahead of him. Leopold, however, is distraught over his son's request to marry Constanze. Despite Nannerl's suggestion of letting them be happy and her insistence that Constanze seems sincere, Leopold is unmoved. She relates to Constanze, understanding her love for Wolfgang, and in Vienna, Constanze reiterates this fact. Wolfgang, unable to believe that Constanze had anything to do with Cecilia's trap for him, confronts Constanze about it. Constanze insists that she didn't know about it and that she loves him of her own accord, so when Wolfgang tells her that it is not enough, she rips up the stolen contract. Now confident in their love, Wolfgang asks her to marry him, and the two are wed ( Les solos sous les draps ).\n\nAfter the ceremony, Rosenberg explains his growing disdain for not only Wolfgang's work, but also for Salieri's nonchalant treatment of it. He mocks Salieri's calm demeanor, as well as his disregard for how successful Wolfgang seems to be in Vienna, unaware that he is being watched by the very person he's ridiculing. Despite his disapproval, he admits to a few decent parts, beginning to sing the overture as one of them. After a short dance, Salieri makes himself known, startling Rosenberg greatly in the process, and proceeds to mimic Rosenberg's previous exaggerated display of his behavior. When asked if he really enjoys Wolfgang's music that much, Rosenberg denies it and explains that he was actually cursing in rage. He also tells Salieri that he plans to have friends of his sit in front of the Emperor at the opera's premiere to boo and hiss it. Salieri hesitates, but ultimately tells him to go ahead with the plan.\n\nAfter the success of The Abduction from the Seraglio , Wolfgang enjoys a celebration with his friends and wife, where they mock Salieri and Rosenberg's attempts at upsetting the show. It is here that Wolfgang is approached by the well-known librettist, Lorenzo Da Ponte , who expresses interest in working with him. He presents Wolfgang with the work he had in mind, but Wolfgang refuses, instead proposing The Marriage of Figaro , a controversial drama by Beaumarchais . Da Ponte initially refuses, wary of the trouble it could cause, but is swayed when Wolfgang explains that he associates not with radical politics, but the triumph of Figaro as a free man. Da Ponte agrees, and they begin work.\n\nAt the rehearsal several months later, Joseph is frustrated to find that his opera has no music, and Wolfgang explains that Rosenberg has crippled his finale by declaring that the use of ballet has been forbidden by the Emperor. Joseph replies that he will simply change the old custom. He instructs Salieri to fix the problem, and Salieri tells Wolfgang to recommence the rehearsal with musical accompaniment.\n\nFrustrated by Salieri's compliance, Rosenberg confronts him and rebuffs the idea that Salieri was getting them out of the mess Rosenberg nearly got them in. Still feeling that Salieri doesn't understand, he is surprised to find that Salieri actually understands very well: The monarchy will never approve of The Marriage of Figaro , and it will be Wolfgang's undoing. He instructs Rosenberg to spread rumors and discord throughout the salons and cast, to bribe them if need be, before sending him off.\n\nHowever, as Rosenberg exits, Salieri is conflicted about his actions, acknowledging again that Wolfgang's music is sublime. He laments his inability to compare with Wolfgang's talent despite dedicating himself to his music day and night, and, driven nearly to madness with jealousy and impending guilt, Salieri attempts to commit suicide ( l'Assasymphonie ). He fails to do so, however, and ultimately lives to see the fruition of his plans.\n\nAs friends of Wolfgang, including Constanze and Aloysia, are celebrating the success of The Marriage of Figaro , Rosenberg appears to tell them that, at the order of the Emperor, the opera has been banned in Vienna. This begins a downward spiral for Wolfgang, starting with his distraction while he and Da Ponte attempt to recover from the failure of Figaro with a new opera, Don Giovanni , due to his father being ill. Unable to leave due to his work, Wolfgang is unable to be in Salzburg with Nannerl when Leopold passes away ( Dors mon ange ).\n\nLater, a mysterious, masked figure appears when Wolfgang is in dire need of money, commissioning him on behalf of an unnamed connoisseur. The commission is for a requiem mass, and Wolfgang is paid 100 ducats upfront with a promise of more when he finishes. The mysterious figure leaves, telling him to work with the greatest possible care. While Constanze believes this will solve their financial problems, Wolfgang worries about something far more serious: he believes the man has come from the afterlife to signal the end.\n\nIn another part of Vienna, a party has gathered to celebrate Salieri obtaining the title of choirmaster of the Imperial Chapel, as well to as mock Wolfgang's latest opera , The Magic Flute . The only one to stand up for Wolfgang is Da Ponte, who quickly leaves in disgust at their display. Although he has achieved everything he wanted, Salieri is bitter about the victory over Wolfgang and spiteful towards himself, knowing it was obtained through underhanded means ( Victime de ma victoire ). He realizes that despite winning, he has still lost.\n\nWolfgang, impoverished and ill, attempts to keep working even as his adversaries continue to openly berate and insult him. While working with his student, S\u00fcssmayr , to complete his requiem, Wolfgang collapses and is ushered to bed by both S\u00fcssmayr and Constanze. His condition continues to worsen, and he struggles to get out of bed when Salieri visits, having heard of Wolfgang's illness and now wishing to reconcile what he'd done. Though Constanze tries to get him to leave, Wolfgang insists on getting from his sickbed to speak with him.\n\nHe confides in Salieri that he will not finish his requiem, and he knows that he is dying. When Constanze becomes upset and tries to call a doctor, he tells her that he only wishes to see S\u00fcssmayr and that everything needed for finishing the requiem is on the desk. Constanze leaves in tears, and Wolfgang realizes how quickly life passes, just as Salieri realizes that the fear and anguish he felt are unimportant, as was the fleeting desire to outdo Wolfgang. They agree to meet each other again, in a place where their rivalry and offenses mean nothing anymore ( Vivre \u00e0 en crever ). The musical ends with Wolfgang's death and ascension.",

        "description": "Popeye is a 1980 American musical comedy film directed by Robert Altman and produced by Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions . It is based on E. C. Segar 's Popeye comics character. The script was written by Jules Feiffer , and stars Robin Williams as Popeye the Sailor Man and Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl . Its story follows Popeye's adventures as he arrives in the town of Sweethaven.\n\nPopeye premiered December 6, 1980, in Los Angeles , California, and opened in the rest of the United States the following week, distributed by Paramount, with Disney handling international distribution through Buena Vista International . During opening weekend, the film grossed $6.3 million, ultimately taking in $60 million worldwide, against a budget of $20 million. When originally released, Popeye received negative reviews from critics, though its reception has improved over time.",
        "synopsis": "Popeye , a gruff but good-hearted sailor, arrives at the small coastal town of Sweethaven while searching for his missing father. He rents a room at the Oyl family's boarding house, where the Oyls plan to have their daughter, Olive , become engaged to Captain Bluto , a powerful, perpetually angry bully who manages the town in the name of the mysterious Commodore.\n\nThe night of the engagement party, Olive sneaks out after discovering that the only attribute that she can report for her bullying fianc\u00e9 is size. She encounters Popeye, who has failed to fit in with the townsfolk at the party. The two eventually find an abandoned baby in a basket. Popeye and Olive adopt the child, naming him Swee'Pea , after the town Sweethaven, and the three return to the Oyls' home. Bluto, whom Olive has stood up, finds out about this encounter and, out of rage, beats up Popeye and imposes heavy taxes on the Oyls' property and possessions. A greedy taxman follows up on Bluto's demand, but Popeye helps the Oyls' financial situation, winning a hefty prize by defeating a boxer named Oxblood Oxheart.\n\nThe next day, Popeye discovers that Swee'Pea can predict the future by whistling when he hears the correct answer to a question. J. Wellington Wimpy , the constantly hungry local mooch and petty gambler, also notices this, and asks Popeye and Olive if he can take Swee'Pea for a walk. He takes him to the horse races and wins two bets. Hearing of this, Olive and her family decide to get in on the action and use Swee'Pea to win, but an outraged Popeye takes Swee'Pea away.\n\nAfter Popeye throws the taxman into the sea (thereby earning the town's respect), Wimpy kidnaps the child at Bluto's orders. That evening, when Olive checks in on Popeye privately, she overhears him lamenting that Swee'Pea deserves to have two parents, and that he regrets leaving the way he did. The next morning, Wimpy informs Popeye about the kidnapping after being threatened by Olive. Popeye goes to the Commodore's ship, where he learns that the Commodore, who has been tied up by Bluto, is indeed Popeye's father, Poopdeck Pappy , who accepts that Popeye is his son after exposing Popeye's hatred of spinach . Meanwhile, Bluto kidnaps Olive, and sets sail with her and Swee'Pea to find the buried treasure promised by Pappy. Popeye, Pappy, Wimpy and the Oyl family board Pappy's ship to chase Bluto to a desolate island in the middle of the ocean, called Scab Island .\n\nPopeye catches up to Bluto and fights him, but is overpowered. During the fight, Pappy recovers his treasure, and opens the chest to reveal a collection of personal, sentimental items from Popeye's infancy, including a few cans of spinach. Salty Sam, a gigantic octopus , awakens and attacks Olive from underwater after Pappy saves Swee'Pea from a similar fate. With Popeye in a choke hold, Pappy throws a can of spinach to him; recognizing Popeye's dislike for spinach, Bluto force-feeds it to him before throwing him into the water. The spinach revitalizes Popeye and boosts his strength, helping him to defeat both Bluto and Salty Sam. Popeye celebrates his victory and his newfound appreciation of spinach while Bluto swims off, having figuratively and literally turned yellow .",

The plot is based on the song \"Earth Girls Are Easy\" from Brown's 1984 EP Goddess in Progress .",
        "synopsis": "In the San Fernando Valley , Valerie Gail works as a manicurist at the Curl Up & Dye salon. Dissatisfied with the lack of sexual interest from her fianc\u00e9, Dr. Ted Gallagher, she receives a makeover from her friend and the salon manager, Candy Pink. That night, Valerie sets out to seduce Ted, but instead, he arrives home with Robin, a nurse. Heartbroken and angry, Valerie kicks him out and destroys his belongings.\n\nMeanwhile, three furry aliens\u2014Mac, Zeebo, and Wiploc\u2014from planet Jhazalla are traveling in a spaceship. It has been a long time since they have had female companionship, and they receive a broadcast showing human females. They are titillated by these \"hairless\", shapely creatures. A fight between Zeebo and Wiploc causes the spaceship to plummet toward Earth, and they crash land into Valerie's swimming pool while she sunbathes. Valerie is frightened at first, but then she invites the aliens into her home. She calls her surf bum friend Woody to come over and drain the pool so the aliens can repair their ship. Despite a language barrier , the aliens prove to be quick learners and absorb American pop culture and language by watching television.\n\nTed tries to call Valerie and leaves a message informing her that he will return home later that night. Fearing Ted's reaction, Valerie takes Mac, Zeebo, and Wiploc to the salon. Although initially scared, Candy agrees to help the aliens blend into their surroundings. After having their fur shaved off, the aliens turn out to be human-looking and attractive. The group decides to go out and party at a local nightclub, where the aliens' looks, athleticism, and incredibly long tongues soon catch the eyes of every woman in the place. Valerie and Mac begin to fall for each other.\n\nTed arrives home and, finding Valerie missing, calls the police. She soon arrives with the aliens, claiming she won an MTV contest to spend the weekend with a rock band. Ted angrily demands that the aliens leave, but when two police officers arrive, Valerie tells them that Ted is attacking her guests. As the officers escort Ted away, he calls off the wedding. Despondent, Valerie retreats to her bedroom and Mac goes in to console her. They discover that they are anatomically compatible and have sex.\n\nThe next day, the pool is fully drained, and Zeebo and Wiploc are working on their ship when Woody stops by and offers to take them to the beach. They agree, and after accidentally holding up a convenience store, Zeebo and Wiploc are soon driving down a freeway the wrong way, in reverse, with the police in pursuit. Mac discovers his crew mates are in trouble and goes to help, but gets arrested along with Woody in a case of mistaken identity. Valerie smashes the police vehicle to get arrested, too, so she can go with Mac.\n\nThe police pursuit ends in a crash, and Zeebo and Wiploc are taken to the emergency room. There, they are examined by Ted, who discovers they have two hearts. While he is envisioning achieving fame and fortune from his discovery, Valerie and Mac elude the police and enter the emergency room disguised as a doctor and a nurse; they manage to convince Ted he is delusional. They then escape back to Valerie's house where work continues on the spaceship. Meanwhile, Valerie and Ted reconcile and plan to elope to Las Vegas immediately.\n\nMac is heartbroken and prepares the ship for takeoff. Valerie goes to say goodbye to her alien friends, followed by Ted, who discovers the ship. While struggling to keep him from calling the authorities, Valerie realizes that Mac is the one she truly loves. She boards the spaceship and they take off.",

Phillips, Alan Baxter, Henry Clapp Smith, and Frank Gabrielson.\n\nWhen Harburg and Vernon Duke parted ways after clashing over Ziegfeld Follies of 1934 , the lyricist invited Arlen, with whom he had written the hit tune \" It's Only a Paper Moon ,\" to collaborate on the revue. Arlen had been writing risqu\u00e9 numbers with Ted Koehler for The Cotton Club in Harlem and welcomed the opportunity to compose music for comedy songs in a mainstream production. The revue also proved to be a stepping stone in the career of Bert Lahr . The actor's unique voice inspired Arlen and Harburg to write songs satirizing romantic and operatic stage clich\u00e9s and helped Lahr evolve from a bumbling buffoon into an adept comic performer. Arlen later maintained \"no one could write for him better than E.Y. and myself.\"\n\nThe original Broadway production opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on August 27, 1934 and closed on March 16, 1935 after a run of 237 performances. It was devised and staged by John Murray Anderson , choreographed by Robert Alton , and starred Ray Bolger , Brian Donlevy , Luella Gear, Frances Williams, Dixie Dunbar, and Esther Junger in addition to Lahr. Among those who contributed to the costume design were Raoul Pene Du Bois and Irene Sharaff .\n\nTime called the production \"the season's first first-rate entertainment.\"\n\nA concert revival at the Library of Congress on March 22, 2010 was recorded and released on CD by PS Classics . This performance featured Rebecca Luker , Brad Oscar and Faith Prince , and the orchestra was conducted by Aaron Gandy.",

        "description": "The Mystery of Edwin Drood is a musical written by Rupert Holmes based on the unfinished Charles Dickens novel of the same name. The show was the first Broadway musical with multiple endings (determined by audience vote). The show won five Tony Awards , including Best Musical , with Holmes awarded for Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score .\n\nThe musical debuted at the New York Shakespeare Festival in August 1985 before transferring to Broadway, where it ran until May 1987, sometimes billed as Drood: The Music Hall Musical , followed by two national tours and a West End production. The Roundabout Theatre Company revived the musical in 2012.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nAct One opens as the members of the Music Hall Royale circulate among the audience, introducing themselves to the patrons. More and more members of the company add to the growing noise until the music begins, and the Chairman of the proceedings bursts forth with the show's opening number, \"There You Are\". They then introduce John Jasper, the 'Jekyll and Hyde' choirmaster who greets his young nephew Edwin Drood in the song \"Two Kinsmen\", where they express their strong friendship. Drood is engaged to the fair Miss Rosa Bud, who is Jasper's music pupil and the object of his mad obsession. Rosa's suspicion of his obsession is confirmed when at her next lesson, he asks her to sing a song he has written \u2013 \"Moonfall\" \u2013 an innuendo-heavy love song from Jasper to her. The kindly Reverend Crisparkle and two exotic emigrants from Ceylon , Helena and Neville Landless, arrive. Neville is immediately attracted to Rosa, which makes him a rival to both Edwin and the secretive Jasper.\n\nNext, the chairman brings the audience to London and the sinister opium den of Princess Puffer who talks with the audience, and explains her life in \"Wages of Sin\". A sinewy ballet dance follows. We discover that one of Puffer's regular clients is none other than Jasper himself, who cries out the name 'Rosa Bud' during a hallucination. Puffer shows great interest in this fact and stores it away in her memory. Back in Cloisterham, Neville and Drood meet and come to odds with each other almost immediately.\n\nNext, The Chairman is called in to play another character as that actor is unable to come, but it turns out that the scenes of his character and the scenes of Mayor Sapsea coincide \u2013 and the characters have to disagree with each other. This results in major confusion for poor Mayor Sapsea/The Chairman and laughs for the audience. He and Jasper sing of their conflicting minds \u2013 Jasper, of course, meaning it literally \u2013 in the patter song \"Both Sides Of The Coin\". We are then introduced to the drunken stonemason Durdles, and his assistant Deputy. In the graveyard, they tell us that Edwin and Rosa, who have been promised to each other since they were children and so cannot tell if they truly love each other, have called off their engagement (\"Perfect Strangers\"). As a parting gift, Rosa gives Drood her hair clasp, which once belonged to her mother.\n\nIt is Christmas Eve and Jasper has arranged a \u2018reconciliation\u2019 dinner for the Landless twins, Crisparkle, Rosa, and Drood. In the resulting song \"No Good Can Come from Bad\", Neville and Drood's antagonism is reinstated, Helena's and Crisparkle's worry about Neville's reputation is shown, and it is revealed that Crisparkle used to be in love with Rosa's mother, who died after Rosa's birth. Soon the party disbands, and the guests depart into a violent storm. There is a short halt here, where the actor playing Bazzard soliloquizes about how he never seems to be able to get a major part in a show, in the song \"Never The Luck\".\n\nThe next day Drood has vanished. Crisparkle's assistant discovers Edwin's torn coat by the river. Drood was last seen walking there with Neville the night before. Neville is almost lynched by the townsfolk before being rescued by Crisparkle. Jasper publicly swears to track down his nephew's killer; later he visits Rosa and confesses his love for her. She is horrified and angry, and they sing \"The Name Of Love And Moonfall\", ending with Jasper's pursuing Rosa off-stage as the act concludes.\n\n### Act II\n\nAct Two begins six months later, and still, there is no sign of Drood. There is much speculation as to his fate. Meanwhile, it is revealed that Puffer has been investigating Drood's disappearance but has also noticed a rather seedy-looking figure who seems to be doing the same. It turns out that this man (played by the same actor who plays Drood, normally), Dick Datchery, is a private investigator. They sing \"Settling Up The Score\". The cast appears and summarizes the situation, warning the audience, \"Don't fall back on your assumptions, hasty presumptions might do you in!\", telling them to think carefully of whom they will vote for as the murderer, in the song \"Don't Quit While You're Ahead\". As the song climbs to a climax, the actors trail off, and the Chairman announces to the audience that it was at this place that Charles Dickens laid down his pen forever.  However, they, with the audience's help, will resolve the story and the public voting begins as to who Datchery and The Murderer are; unfortunately, the actress playing Drood and, up to that point, Datchery is not chosen as Datchery exits the theater in a huff.  Once the votes have been tabulated, the cast comes out and sings \"Don't Quit While You're Ahead\" to welcome the audience back into the story and to remind them that the mystery has not been solved.\n\nPuffer finds Rosa, reveals that years before she had been Rosa's nanny, and tells her backstory in the song \"Garden Path To Hell\"; she tells of a man she loved who made her become a prostitute to please his friends and then left her. Once she lost her looks, she found a way to earn money \u2013 selling opium. She then continues with \"Puffer's Revelation\" and reveals the identity of Datchery (previously chosen by the audience.) The evening's Datchery (either Bazzard, Reverend Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, or Rosa) explains in their version of the revelation song \"Out On A Limerick\" why they donned the costume and tracked down the killer; the girls did it mainly to disguise their gender, Neville to prove his innocence, Crisparkle to help both Neville and Helena and Bazzard to give himself both a dramatic reveal and an important character to play. The gist of each song is that the character follows Jasper to his house and finds the clasp that Rosa gave Drood, which Jasper would have had only if he had taken it from Drood. Jasper's double nature reveals itself, and he admits that he strangled his nephew while under the influence of the laudanum that he revealed he poured into the wine the night of the dinner party (\"Jasper's Confession\").\n\nDurdles the gravedigger, however, disagrees; he witnessed the crime and knows who truly killed Edwin Drood. Depending on the audience's vote, the finger is pointed at Bazzard, Crisparkle, Helena, Neville, Puffer, Rosa, or Durdles. The murderer confesses, then sings a reprise of one of several numbers, beginning with \"A Man Could Go Quite Mad\", to admit his or her culpability; the gist of each of these songs is that the character who killed Drood was seeking to kill Jasper , not Drood, for his or her purpose \u2013 Puffer to protect Rosa, Rosa to save herself, Helena to get revenge on Jasper for ruining her twin's chance at a new beginning, Bazzard to bring himself into the limelight, Neville because he wanted Rosa for himself, and Crisparkle because he killed Rosa's mother out of jealousy and religious mania and wanted to protect both Rosa and Neville from Jasper's evil. However, because of the storm, Jasper had walked with Drood for a while and then given him his coat to wear for the journey home, so the murderer, because of the laudanum in the wine and the foul night weather, mistook Drood for Jasper. (Durdles lacks this motivation, however, so his confession is simply that, in his drunkenness, he mistook Drood for a ghost.) If, although not likely, the audience chooses Jasper as the murderer, Durdles does not interrupt and a second confession is not performed (Some theaters will not count Jasper's votes, to make sure that there is a twist).\n\nStill, a happy ending is needed, and the Chairman asks the audience to choose two lovers from among the remaining cast members. The two chosen members declare their love, and then reprise \"Perfect Strangers\". Just then, there comes a noise from the crypt, and a very much alive Edwin Drood appears, ready to tell all that happened on the night of his disappearance (\"The Writing On The Wall\"). What happened was that when Drood was attacked, he was only stunned when he fell and not killed. Jasper dragged him to a crypt where he left him. When Drood woke, he escaped and fled from Cloisterham, only returning so that he could find out who wanted him dead. He sings to the audience, eventually joined by the rest of the cast, imploring them to hold on to life for as long as they possibly can and telling them that 'holding on to life is all.' The mystery is solved, and the show concludes as the cast sings to the audience to read the writing on the wall.\n\n### Murderers",

        "description": "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is a 1978 American jukebox musical comedy film directed by Michael Schultz , written by Henry Edwards and starring an ensemble cast led by Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees . Depicting the loosely constructed story of a band as they wrangle with the music industry and battle evil forces bent on stealing their instruments and corrupting their hometown of Heartland, the film is presented in a form similar to that of a rock opera , with the songs providing \"dialogue\" to carry the story . George Burns has most of the spoken lines that act to clarify the plot and provide further narration.\n\nThe film's soundtrack, released as an accompanying double album , features new versions of songs originally written and performed by the Beatles . The film draws primarily from two of the band's albums, 1967's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and 1969's Abbey Road , with additional selections from other Beatles albums.\n\nThe production was loosely adapted from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road , a 1974 off-Broadway production directed by Tom O'Horgan . The film was met with minor box office success, grossing $20.4 million against a budget of $13 million, but overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics for its weak plot and poor acting as well as its musical interpretations. However, some of the musical numbers, particularly Earth, Wind & Fire's cover of \" Got to Get You Into My Life \" and Aerosmith's cover of \" Come Together \", were met with high praise, the former earning Earth, Wind & Fire a Grammy , and the latter being a top-25 hit single.",
        "synopsis": "Mr. Kite ( George Burns ), elderly mayor of the small, wholesome town of Heartland, recounts the history of Heartland's celebrated marching band. Sgt. Pepper and his Lonely Hearts Club Band brought happiness through its music, even causing troops in World Wars I and II to stop fighting. On August 10, 1958, Sgt. Pepper died of a heart attack at the unveiling of a new weather vane in his likeness. Sgt. Pepper left the band's magical musical instruments to the town; so long as they remain in Heartland, its people will live happily ever after. He also left his musical legacy to his handsome and good-hearted grandson, Billy Shears ( Peter Frampton ). Billy forms a new Lonely Hearts Club Band with his three best friends: brothers Mark, Dave, and Bob Henderson ( the Bee Gees ). Billy's charming but avaricious half-brother, Dougie ( Paul Nicholas ), serves as the band's manager (\" Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band \").\n\nHeartland loves the new band (\" With a Little Help from My Friends \"), and soon Big Deal Records president B.D. Hoffler ( Donald Pleasence ) invites them to Hollywood with the promise of a record deal (\" Fixing a Hole \"), which the band accepts (\" Getting Better \"). Billy bids farewell to his sweet hometown girlfriend, Strawberry Fields ( Sandy Farina ) (\" Here Comes the Sun \"). Once in Hollywood, B.D. introduces the band to their new labelmates, sexy singers Lucy (Dianne Steinberg) and the Diamonds ( Stargard ), and they negotiate the contract over a sex-and-drug-fueled dinner (\" I Want You (She's So Heavy) \"). Hitting it off with Lucy, Billy all but forgets about Strawberry. The band quickly succeeds (\" Good Morning, Good Morning \"), with hit records and sold-out concerts produced and performed as quickly as they succeeded (\" Nowhere Man \"/\" Polythene Pam \"/\" She Came In Through the Bathroom Window \"/\" Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) \").\n\nMeanwhile, villainous Mr. Mustard ( Frankie Howerd ) and his henchman, the Brute, drive to Heartland in their computer- and robot-equipped van, under orders from the mysterious FVB to steal the magical instruments from City Hall and distribute them among FVB and its affiliates (\" Mean Mr. Mustard \"). Without the instruments, Heartland quickly degenerates into a hotbed of vice and urban decay . Strawberry takes an early morning bus to Hollywood (\" She's Leaving Home \") to warn the band (\" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds \"/\" Oh! Darling \"). Mustard, who has a crush on Strawberry, follows. In Hollywood, the band and Strawberry steal Mustard's van and use its computer to locate the stolen instruments, recovering the cornet from the deranged, money-driven anti-aging specialist Dr. Maxwell Edison ( Steve Martin ) (\" Maxwell's Silver Hammer \"), and the tuba from mind-controlling cult leader Father Sun ( Alice Cooper ) (\" Because \"). Billy is knocked out in each battle, with nothing except Strawberry's love keeping him going (\" Strawberry Fields Forever \"). The group easily find the bass drum, which Mr. Mustard kept for himself in the van. However, the computer and robots malfunction and self-destruct before they can locate the final missing instrument (the saxophone).\n\nAs Heartland continues to deteriorate, Billy and the Hendersons, with a bit of help from Dougie, manage to convince B.D. to organize a benefit concert to save the town (\" Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite! \"). Dougie and Lucy, who have bonded over their shared love of money, plot to run off with the show's proceeds (\" You Never Give Me Your Money \") while Billy, Strawberry, and the Hendersons are watching Earth, Wind & Fire perform at the benefit (\" Got to Get You into My Life \"). Mustard and the Brute suddenly arrive and take back the van, containing the recovered instruments and the benefit money, and also kidnap Strawberry (\" When I'm Sixty-Four \"). Billy and the Hendersons see the van leave and pursue it in the town's hot air balloon.\n\nMustard drives to FVB's headquarters, where the Future Villain Band ( Aerosmith ) plans to take over the world. To turn Strawberry into a \"mindless groupie\", FVB chains her up onstage while the band plays (\" Come Together \") and the lead singer ( Steven Tyler ) fondles her. Billy and the Hendersons arrive and engage FVB in hand-to-hand combat. The singer is thrown off the stage to his death, but so is Strawberry.\n\nThe town of Heartland, now cleaned up and the instruments returned, holds an elaborate funeral for Strawberry (\" Golden Slumbers \"/\" Carry That Weight \"). The depressed Billy attempts to get Strawberry off his mind (\" The Long and Winding Road \"); when he cannot, the Hendersons worry for him (\" A Day in the Life \"). Billy finally attempts suicide by jumping from a rooftop. Before he can hit the ground, in a form of Deus ex machina , the Sgt. Pepper weather vane atop City Hall comes to life ( Billy Preston ). Wielding magical lightning bolts, the weather vane catches Billy and reverses his suicide attempt, then dances through the town square (\" Get Back \"), transforming Mustard and the Brute into a bishop and a monk, Mustard's van into a Volkswagen Beetle , and Dougie and Lucy into a priest and nun. The weather vane restores Strawberry to life and transforms the Hendersons' mourning suits into shiny new uniforms.\n\nIn the finale, the cast appears with numerous celebrities in a tribute to the original Beatles album cover (\" Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Finale) \").",

Huey plays a rock & roll hit (\"Scratch My Itch\"). He sells 29 records in five minutes, but the store owner fires him anyway, incensed at the type of music being played.\n\nHuey returns to Delray's club, and begins flirting with Felicia, Delray's talented sister, and promises to get her on the radio (\"Ain't Nothin' But a Kiss\"). Huey then proceeds to apply for DJ jobs at various local white radio stations (\"Hello My Name is Huey\"). One of the owners, Mr. Simmons, invites him in, saying he'll show him what a 'real' DJ looks like. Huey hijacks the mic, and plays another African-American rock song (\"Everybody Wants to be Black on Saturday Night\").\n\nMr. Simmons is about to have Huey thrown out, but then dozens of teenagers start calling in demanding more of Huey and his music (\"That's Not Possible\"). Mr. Simmons agrees to give him a two-week trial, and if he's successful he'll get hired full-time. After a few days Huey is told to read an advertisement for beer, but he is illiterate . Huey asks Bobby, a friend of Delray's with a janitor position, to tell him what it says. He forgets the exact words almost immediately and begins to improvise, ending with the phrase \"Hockadoo!\".\n\nMr. Simmons again almost fires Huey, until the manager of the store advertised calls in saying that he wants Huey to do all of his advertisements, seeing as his stock sold out in minutes. Huey's station gains immediate popularity, as does his new catch phrase, even though no one understands what it means...including Huey.\n\nWhile on the radio, Huey encourages white people to go down to black churches (\"Make Me Stronger\"), and they begin to. Meanwhile, Delray has saved enough money to put Felicia's voice on the record, and she travels to Huey's house to tell him this. He is overjoyed and promises to play it the next day. Huey's prejudiced mother, however, breaks the record, which leaves Felicia heartbroken, but Huey tells her to come down to the radio station anyway (\"Colored Woman\").\n\nThe next day, Huey brings in a band and back-up singers to play for Felicia live. Despite her reservations, Felicia sings and becomes an instant sensation (\"Someday\"). Felicia and Huey's relationship begins to grow, and Delray is becoming more and more infuriated with Huey. He warns him of the danger of what he is doing, threatening to harm Huey if anything happens to Felicia (\"She's My Sister\"). Huey's radio popularity grows more and more as white teens and black teens begin to accept each other (\"Radio\"). Huey and Felicia have been carrying on a secret relationship since the day she sang live on the radio.\n\nTwo years later Huey proposes to Felicia on the way to a party at Delray's. She says no because of laws and prejudice, but admits that without those obstacles she would accept. As the two share a kiss, a gang of white men pass by, spotting this. They hold Huey down as they beat Felicia with a bat. Huey manages to carry her into the club, crying out for help. Delray tries to go after Huey, for he promised to harm Huey should Felicia get hurt because of him, but Gator, a friend who has not spoken since he saw his father lynched as a child, calms him and sends out a prayer for change as Delray takes Felicia outside and gets her into the ambulance they called (\"Say a Prayer\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nTime has passed, and Huey is about to open his new TV show, a rock and roll variety show featuring all-black dancers (\"Crazy Little Huey\"). Felicia is supposed to be his first guest, but she backs out at the last minute, fearing that people will think she and Huey to be in a relationship. Huey informs Bobby that he will fill in, and after getting over some jitters, Bobby brings the house down (\"Big Love\"). Felicia's popularity is also beginning to grow around Memphis, as does her relationship with Huey.\n\nFelicia tells Huey that if they went to New York they wouldn't have to sneak around all the time, but Huey insists that they are happy the way they are and don't need to leave (\"Love Will Stand When All Else Falls\"). She has been discovered by a talent agency in New York, as has Huey's TV show. The agency wants them both to come up to New York, although Huey has to compete with Dick Clark for the national show. They ponder the decision (\"Stand Up\"), and are even supported by Huey's mother, who has changed her racist ways after seeing a black church choir (\"Change Don't Come Easy\").\n\nHuey is told he has won the TV position if he agrees not to use black dancers. Huey refuses and proceeds to strip out of his suit on the air (\"Tear Down the House\"). Felicia tells Huey that she plans to go anyway, as it is her dream. In a desperate attempt to keep her, he kisses her on the air, and says he loves her (\"Love Will Stand/Ain't Nothin' But a Kiss\" (Reprise)). The feed is cut, and Huey is fired on the grounds that no one would watch his show if they knew about him and Felicia, and that he wasn't the only white person to play black music anymore. Felicia is taken away by Delray in an attempt to save her career.\n\nNow unemployed, Huey leaves the station and ponders his relationship with Memphis, realizing he couldn't leave for any reason (\"Memphis Lives in Me\"). Four years later, Huey is a DJ on an obviously low budget and low rated station (he jokes that they have \"exactly one listener\"). Felicia walks in, about to start a national tour. She tells Huey that she is engaged to a man named Bill, but that she wants him to join her on stage one last time. He refuses, afraid that no one will remember him. She begins her performance, and halfway through the song Huey walks on stage and finishes the song with her to thunderous applause. He then proclaims \"The name is Huey Calhoun. Goodnight and HOCKADOO!\" (\"Steal Your Rock and Roll\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe Life depicts the pulsating life on the Times Square streets in the 1980s, where everything had a price, especially sex\u2014the garish topless bars, the transvestite joints, the hookers who worked the side walks at the bidding of their pimps (\"Check It Out!\").\n\nJojo, an opportunistic, conniving white hustler in the thick of the action, has a bare knuckled plan for feeding his ambition (\"Use What You Got\"). But among these unsavoury characters there are appealing people who have been caught in the web of these sordid surroundings. Sonja, a veteran hooker who has seen better days, befriends Queen who is on the street because her man, Fleetwood, a displaced Vietnam veteran, needs her support. She has saved her money and on this day plans to get away with Fleetwood and leave the life for good, enjoying, with Sonja (\"A Lovely Day to Be Out of Jail\"). Returning to her hotel room, Queen discovers that Fleetwood has spent half of her savings to pay off his drug debts and feed his habit.\n\nFleetwood has an unrealistic dream of attaining power and money (\"A Piece of the Action\"). Jojo tells him he'll never amount to anything as a pimp as long as he's romantically involved with the woman he's selling. Jojo takes him to the Port Authority where they find Mary, just off the bus from Minnesota , a girl with the mien of an angel but, as we eventually find out, she's no angel. Jojo grabs at her suitcase so that Fleetwood can rescue it and become her hero.\n\nThe demi-monde hangs out at a bar owned by Lacy, who has seen it all but has certain affection for his clientele. In the company of her sister whores, Sonja bemoans the wear and tear of her life (\"The Oldest Profession\"). When Fleetwood and Mary arrive, Memphis, the \"biggest businessman on the block\" comments on the professionalism of his trade and soon zeroes in on the newcomer (\"Don't Take Much\").\nReluctantly, Queen takes Mary to the room she shares with Fleetwood and tries to persuade her to go home (\"Go Home\"). Later, as prostitutes eye potential customers, a gospel group parades by (\"You Can't Get to Heaven\"). The girls defiantly stand up for themselves (\"My Body\"), while the pimps complain about the harassment of the police (\"Why Don't They Leave Us Alone?\").\n\nJojo cajoles Mary into taking a turn as a go-go dancer. A smashing success, she celebrates her good fortune with Fleetwood and Jojo, who has her in mind for his \"mentor\" Lou, a gaudy Los Angeles producer of \"motion pictures\" of the triple X genre, who's looking for fresh corn-fed talent (\"Easy Money\").\n\nOnce again in jail, Queen reflects on her attachment to Fleetwood (\"He's No Good\"); while, enticed by Mary, Jojo and Fleetwood spend the night with her in a threesome. As Fleetwood turns his attentions toward Mary, Memphis makes his move to put \"Queen in his deck\". Queen discovers what's been going on between Fleetwood and Mary, and decides she's finally had enough (\"I'm Leaving You\"). As everyone parties at The Hookers' Ball, Lou makes off with Mary, while Queen, shunning Fleetwood, attaches herself to Memphis (\"The Hooker's Ball\").\n\n### Act II\n\nOver a game of Three-card Monte (\"Step Right Up\"), Jojo and the pimps discuss their \"silent partner\", Mr. Greed (\"Mr. Greed\"). In Memphis' spacious apartment, Queen thanks him for getting her out of jail and for the beautiful dress he gave her to wear to the Hookers' Ball; but Memphis makes it very clear that the dress was a $6,000 loan that she must repay with her earnings (\"My Way or the Highway\"). He warns Queen that she better not leave town \"cause you'll be coming back real soon for a funeral \u2013 Fleetwood's; followed shortly by your own\".\n\nQueen tells Sonja that she must find Fleetwood and warn him about Memphis' threat. She asks Jojo to tell Fleetwood to meet her the next morning at Lacy's. Meanwhile, Mary, with Lou, toasts her acceptance of his offer of a movie career (\"People Magazine\").\n\nThe next morning Jojo double crosses Queen and comes to Lacy's with Memphis, who brutally flogs the terrified woman. When Fleetwood arrives, Queen reminds him of what they once had together (\"We Had a Dream\"). When Fleetwood returns to his hotel, he finds Mary leaving for Los Angeles.\n\nNear the Lincoln Tunnel , Memphis' henchman, Snickers, pushes Queen to get \"plenty of action tonight. Memphis is dependin' on it\" (\"Use What You Got\" (Reprise)). She, Sonja and other girls share their hopes for the future (\"'Someday' is for Suckers\").\n\nLater, near the Hudson River in a spot once special to Queen and Fleetwood, Sonja hands Queen a bus ticket and a suitcase in a desperate attempt to get her away from Memphis. Fleetwood unexpectedly appears and tries to talk Queen into making a new start (\"We Gotta Go\"), but Queen bitterly rejects him. Jojo guides Memphis onto the scene. Fleetwood pulls a gun on Memphis, but Jojo knocks the gun loose as Memphis mortally stabs Fleetwood; Queen seizes the fallen gun and shoots Memphis. Sonja decides to take the rap for killing Memphis, claiming self-defence; she and Queen say goodbye (\"My Friend\"), then Queen departs for the bus, which will carry her to freedom, as Sonja surrenders to the police.

The off-Broadway production by Playwrights Horizons began previews at the Duke Theatre on 42nd Street on September 7, 2001, and concluded its scheduled run on October 14, 2001. It won the Richard Rodgers Production Award, administered by the American Academy of Arts and Letters . The musical depicts the journey of a young woman just released from prison, who decides to start her life anew in a rural town in Wisconsin. She participates in a journey within the town toward its own tenuous reawakening.",
        "synopsis": "Place: A small town. Time: Not long ago. February. A young woman, Percy Talbott, gazes out the window of her prison cell, from which she is about to be released. In her pocket is a photograph clipped from a travel book with a caption that states \"Autumn colors along Copper Creek near Gilead, Wisconsin\" (\"A Ring Around the Moon\"). Arriving in Gilead, Percy reports to the local sheriff, Joe Sutter. He leads her through the deserted streets to a ramshackle diner called the Spitfire Grill, run by a crusty old widow, Hannah Ferguson, who has a bad hip and a sharp tongue. Joe persuades Hannah to take Percy on board and give her work as a waitress.\n\nPercy sets to work in a swirl of small-town suspicions led by Effy, the postmistress and village busybody (\"Something's Cooking at the Spitfire Grill\"). In the face of all the gossip and Hannah's constant haranguing, Percy begins to wonder whether she made a mistake in coming to Gilead (\"Coffee Cups and Gossip\"). Her thoughts are interrupted by a cry from Hannah, who has tripped on the stairs and broken her leg. Over the protests of her fiercely protective nephew, Caleb, Hannah has Percy take over the Spitfire. When it comes to cooking, though, Percy is clueless (\"Into the Frying Pan\"). That night, without explaining why, Hannah reluctantly asks Percy to wrap a towel around a loaf of bread and to leave it near the old stump out back of the grill.\n\nPercy is joined at the Spitfire by Caleb's wife Shelby, an excellent cook. In the heat of the kitchen, the two women are drawn together. Shelby tells Percy about Hannah and Gilead's past, the day her childhood hero went off to war and her hometown changed forever (\"When Hope Goes\").\n\nWanting to escape painful memories, Hannah has had the Grill on the real estate market for 10 years with no takers. In a moment of inspiration, Percy proposes a way for Hannah to get rid of the Spitfire and make some money at the same time: a raffle. For $100 and an essay about why they might want the Grill, anyone can enter. At first, Hannah resists, but slowly, something about the craziness of the idea convinces her that it just might work. As the rest of the town watches the long Wisconsin winter stubbornly give way to spring (\"Ice and Snow\"), the women at the Spitfire plan the details of the contest. Percy and Shelby share a vision of life as they wish it were, while writing the advertisement for the raffle (\"The Colors of Paradise\").\n\nCaleb spots the contest ads as they begin to appear in out-of-town papers. Without a decent job since the local quarry closed, Caleb has been left trying to sell real estate that no one wants. His frustration turns against a world where being a hard-working man is no longer enough (\"Digging Stone\").\n\nDuring a parole session with Sheriff Joe Sutter, Percy tells of her bleak past growing up in the West Virginia coal mine region. Joe, in turn, spills out his dissatisfaction with life in Gilead (\"This Wide Woods\").\n\nAs summer approaches, the first raffle entry arrives in the mail, complete with $100 and a rather depressing essay, which stirs up some of Hannah's old wounds (\"Forgotten Lullaby\"). That night, while placing the usual loaf of bread out back, Percy encounters a silent visitor. She attempts to make conversation, but the mysterious man merely takes the bread and flees. Weeks go by, and essays begin to pour into the grill from far and wide (\"Shoot the Moon\").\n\nHannah, Percy, and Shelby sit in the Spitfire Grill after hours, reading essays and drinking from a jug of Hannah's infamous applejack. As they read the letters, some funny, some sad, Hannah expresses her appreciation for what Percy and Shelby have done (\"Come Alive Again\"). Before long, it seems everyone in town is helping Hannah to sift through the letters, and a magical shift occurs, not only at the Spitfire, but throughout Gilead as well.\n\nLate one October night on the back porch, Joe tells Percy that he no longer wants to leave Gilead. He plans to build a house on a plot of land his father has given to him (\"Forest for the Trees\"). Deeply troubled, Percy abruptly rejects Joe's proposal of marriage and confides to Shelby the harsh details of her life. Impregnated by her stepfather when she was 16, Percy suffered untold abuse resulting in the loss of her unborn child. While on the run, she killed her stepfather with his own straight razor. Shelby comforts Percy and gently sings her to sleep (\"Wild Bird\").\n\nWhen Percy awakens, she sees the mysterious visitor and at last realizes he is none other than Eli, Hannah's own son. Eli leads Percy deep into the forest and then to a clearing atop a hill. The leaves have turned to autumn colors and as the sun rises, they burn like flame (\"Shine\").\n\nTransformed by her hilltop vision, Percy leads Eli back to the Grill to reunite him with Hannah after so many years. In a painful confrontation, Shelby and Caleb recognize Eli and react with such shock at his battered appearance and broken demeanor that Eli flees.  Hannah finally admits that Eli had been a deserter in the war. The shame of it killed her husband, and though Hannah has taken care of Eli's basic needs, she has kept his presence in the woods a secret from the entire town. Percy pleads with Hannah to forgive Eli. Day passes into night and Hannah calls out to her son (\"Way Back Home\").  Out of the shadows, Eli appears in the grill once more. Hannah and Eli tentatively face one another as mother and son.\n\nOn the last day of the contest, everybody reads their favorite essays. Finally, Hannah reads the words that have touched her the most - the ad describing the grill, written by Percy and Shelby. In gratitude for their role in reuniting mother and son, while admitting she is not offering much in return, Hannah turns over the Grill to Percy and Shelby (\"Finale\").",

It features the voice of Judy Garland as Mewsette, a cat living in the French countryside wanting to go to Paris in her only animated-film role, as well as Robert Goulet in his first feature film as her love interest Jaune Tom. While the film did receive positive reviews, in reality, it was a box office failure . It is also the first animated feature film to be theatrically released by Warner Bros, and the second and final animated film by UPA.",
        "synopsis": "The story is predominantly set in 1895 Paris but starts on a rural Provence farm. The lovely cat Mewsette and the accomplished but shy mouser Jaune Tom are in love until Mewsette becomes frustrated with Tom's plebeian ways (and those of farmlife), and calls him a \"clumsy country clod\". Inspired by the human Jeanette's stories of the glamour and sophistication of Parisian life , Mewsette runs away to Paris. Upon arrival, she encounters the slick con-cat Meowrice. Taking advantage of Mewsette's country naivete, he puts her in the sultry Madame Henrietta Reubens-Chatte care. She promises to turn Mewsette into a dainty debutante known as \"The Belle of all Paris\". Unbeknownst to Mewsette, Meowrice is grooming her to be the mail-order bride of a rich American cat known as \"Mr. Henry Phtt\" (\"The Money Cat\"). Meanwhile, Jaune Tom and his sidekick, Robespierre, arrive in Paris to search for Mewsette.\n\nMewsette's training does not go well. Just as she about to give up and return to the farm, Meowrice takes her out to see Paris' feline side of the Eiffel Tower , the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es , the Mewlon Rouge , and then a buggy ride back to Madame Henrietta's. Reinvigorated, she returns to her studies. Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive in Paris but get waylaid by one of Meowrice's shadowy cat henchmen and barely escape drowning in Paris's labyrinthine sewers . By coincidence, Jaune Tom displays his incredible mouse-hunting skills in front of Meowrice, who seeing a money-making opportunity, gets them drunk, and sells them as mousers on a ship bound for Alaska. On the ship, Robespierre consoles a depressed Jaune Tom, telling him that any problem can be broken up into manageable pieces.\n\nMewsette finishes her training and is now lovely enough to impress even Meowrice, who commissions a series of portraits of her to send to Phtt. Meowrice quietly writes a check with invisible ink to pay Madame Reubens-Chatte for her services, then takes Mewsette to his hideout in Notre-Dame . He reveals his plan to ship her to America and tries to coerce her into a luggage crate. After seeing a portrait of Phtt, Mewsette escapes Meowrice and his sidekicks. She leads them on a chase to a bulldog, who injures Meowrice badly enough to put him out of action for six weeks. Meanwhile, his sycophants unsuccessfully comb the city for Mewsette and, shortly after arriving in Alaska, Jaune Tom and Robespierre strike gold . Now wealthy, the two cats hurry back to Paris.\n\nA disillusioned and homeless Mewsette wanders around Paris. She stops atop a bridge over the river, considering ending her misery. Just then, Meowrice and his cohorts ambush and capture her. She is taken to the Gare du Nord railway station , en route to a boat bound for America. All hope seems lost until Jaune Tom and Robespierre arrive. They have been aided by Madame Henrietta, who is outraged that Meoworice double-crossed her. Fighting inside the train, the three heroes defeat Meowrice and pack him into the packing crate as a surprise for Phtt. The film concludes with Mewsette, Jaune Tom, and Robespierre enjoying the high life in Paris that Mewsette was seeking when she left home.",

Moulin Rouge! is set in Paris during the Belle Epoque ; it follows Christian, a young composer, who falls in love with Satine, a courtesan and the star of the Moulin Rouge cabaret.\n\nThe musical premiered on July 10, 2018, at the Emerson Colonial Theatre in Boston . Moulin Rouge! began performances on Broadway at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre , in June 2019, with an official opening on July 25. The production was nominated for 14 Tony Awards , winning 10 (the most that year), including Best Musical . Moulin Rouge! continues its run in New York and has been produced for long runs around the world, including in the West End , beginning in 2021.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn the Montmartre Quarter of Paris, France, at the turn of the 20th century, the Moulin Rouge cabaret club, \"where all your dreams come true\", is in full swing under the direction of Harold Zidler. Christian arrives with fellow bohemians Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Santiago the Argentinean. The money-motivated Duke of Monroth is introduced (\"Welcome to the Moulin Rouge\"). Christian interrupts Zidler to start a story \"about love\", concerning a woman named Satine.\n\nThe story begins in 1899, as Christian arrives in the Montmartre district of Paris from Lima, Ohio , where he meets Toulouse-Lautrec and Santiago, who are attempting to create a play with songs in it. The two are impressed by Christian's musical and songwriting talents and ask for help to get their work produced at the Moulin Rouge. The trio celebrates bohemian ideals (\"Truth, Beauty, Freedom, Love\"). At the Moulin Rouge, Zidler introduces Satine, the star of the club and a courtesan (\"The Sparkling Diamond\"). After Satine performs, Zidler prepares for her to meet and impress the Duke of Monroth, who might invest in the Moulin Rouge and save it from financial ruin. However, Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke and invites him to her dressing room in \"the Elephant\" outside the club (\"Shut Up and Raise Your Glass\").\n\nDancers at the club share their worries with Satine backstage about the Moulin's financial future. Satine, who is concealing her worsening consumption from her colleagues, resolves to stay strong for them (\" Firework \"). Christian arrives in the Elephant hoping to impress Satine with his musical talent, whereas Satine is prepared to seduce him, under the impression that he is the Duke. Christian's true identity is revealed (\" Your Song \"). The Duke interrupts them; Christian and Satine claim they were practicing lines for a new show, Bohemian Rhapsody . With Zidler's help, Christian, Satine, Toulouse, and Santiago pitch the show to the Duke with an improvised plot about an evil gangster attempting to woo an ingenue who loves a poor sailor (\"So Exciting! (The Pitch Song)\"). The Duke decides to back the show, and Zidler reminds Satine that her duty is to keep the Duke happy for the sake of the Moulin Rouge. She rejects Christian, the Duke returns, and he and Satine spend the evening together (\"Sympathy for the Duke\").\n\nIn Montmartre, Toulouse shares with Christian that he fell in love with Satine many years ago, when she was living on the streets. Though impressed by her spirit, he was too shy to confess his love for her over the years. He urges Christian to fight for Satine, insisting to him, \"The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return\" (\" Nature Boy \"). Christian returns to Satine to persuade her that they should be together. Reluctantly, she eventually returns his affections (\"Elephant Love Medley\").\n\n### Act II\n\nTwo months later, rehearsals are underway for Bohemian Rhapsody . Christian and Satine continue seeing each other secretly, and Santiago falls in love with dancer Nini (\"Backstage Romance\"). Tensions rise between Toulouse and the controlling Duke. Nini tells Satine that she needs to be careful about her relationship with Christian and keep the Duke happy, as he once threw a vial of acid in the face of another woman who betrayed him. Satine tells Christian that their relationship endangers the show and the Moulin Rouge, but he counters by writing a secret love song to affirm their love (\" Come What May \").\n\nIn the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es neighborhood, the Duke tells Satine that he wants every part of her, including her heart. When Satine's protests that she does not \"fit in\" with his upper-class Parisian society, he remodels her image against her wishes (\"Only Girl in a Material World\"). The Duke continues to involve himself in Bohemian Rhapsody's creative aspects, to Toulouse's frustration. It becomes clear that the show is a metaphor for Christian, Satine, and the Duke who, enraged on realizing this, threatens to reconsider his investment entirely. Zidler reminds Satine that she alone can appease the Duke. Satine's illness worsens, but she urges her colleagues not to share that she is ill; she wants to fight to keep the Moulin Rouge and the play alive.\n\nToulouse and Santiago urge Christian to forget Satine and move on. Christian gets drunk on absinthe , imagining Satine as The Green Fairy (\" Chandelier \"). He expresses jealousy and disgust that Satine is with the Duke instead of him, ignoring Zidler's warning that loving a prostitute \"always ends badly\" (\" El Tango de Roxanne \"). At his castle, the Duke tells Satine that he will have Christian killed if she chooses him. Christian tries to persuade Satine to leave with him, singing their secret song. Knowing that Christian would be killed if she says otherwise, Satine tells Christian that she does not love him. Christian leaves.\n\nChristian, in despair, loads a prop gun with real bullets, planning to commit suicide on stage during the show's opening night. Meanwhile, Satine's illness dramatically worsens. Together, she and Toulouse stand up to the Duke, who leaves the Moulin Rouge before the performance begins (\"Crazy Rolling\"). As Satine performs, Christian enters and asks her to face him as he turns the gun towards himself. Satine sings their secret song, which saves his life by revealing to him that she loved him the entire time. After a final song together in which the two affirm their love one last time, Satine tells Christian to \"tell our story\" and dies in his arms (\"Your Song\" (reprise)). Christian declares that his and Satine's story will forever be told (\"Finale (Come What May)\").\n\n### Differences from the film\n\nChanges were made in adapting the film for the stage. The show-within-a-show is no longer the Bollywood -inspired Spectacular Spectacular but the more subdued Bohemian Rhapsody . Christian, now American rather than English, is the leading actor in the show along with composing it. Satine is portrayed as older and mentors her coworkers. She dedicates herself to the club's survival and finds the (now charismatic) Duke's offers of financial security more compelling. She and the Duke are immediately involved in a sexual relationship, whereas in the film she seeks to evade it. Satine is also aware of her fatal diagnosis. The absinthe scene is moved much later in the musical, and Christian's inebriated state influences his decisions in the final scenes, where he threatens suicide instead of disparaging Satine. The Duke leaves the Moulin Rouge when Satine rebukes him before the final performance, and he no longer tries to kill Christian after the lovers reunite. Zidler is portrayed as gay.",

        "description": "That Bloody Woman is a 2015 punk-rock musical written by Luke Di Somma and Gregory Cooper . It is based on the life of Kate Sheppard and charts the suffragism struggle in New Zealand and its opposition by Richard Seddon . The musical was commissioned by Christchurch Arts Festival and premiered there in August 2015. It played in Auckland and Christchurch in 2016, and toured New Plymouth , Wellington and Dunedin in 2017. An original cast recording was made and released in 2016. That Bloody Woman is set to hit the Christchurch stage once again as Showbiz Christchurch prepare for their opening night on 5 July, featuring an all-female creative team and rock band.",
        "synopsis": "The show opens in 1868 with Kate Sheppard travelling from England to New Zealand and settling in Christchurch, where she meets and marries accountant Walter, and has a son, Douglas. She meets her best friend Jennie and Jennie's husband William Lovell-Smith. Kate realises that social and economic inequities were just as bad in New Zealand as in England, and the women had little power to effect change. Problems of alcohol and domestic violence are described.\n\nThe turning point for Kate is attending an event in 1885 where she hears the Women's Christian Temperance Union's Mary Leavett speak. Kate goes on to establish the New Zealand WCTU with Ada Wells and Jennie Lovell-Smith. Despite lots of activities with the WCTU, Kate realises nothing is changing, and nothing will change until women have the right to vote.\n\nThe 1891 suffrage petition is begun, and women use bicycles to access large areas to canvas support. However, 10,000 signatures is not enough and the petition fails. Richard \"King Dick\" Seddon rails against Kate and her followers, and works to discredit them.\n\nA second petition gets more than 20,000 signatures, but Kate's efforts are again stymied by Seddon. Walter takes their son to England and Kate is unable to stop him as children are legally the property of their father. Kate also reveals that she is in love with William Lovell-Smith, her best friend's husband. Kate's female supporters urge her not to give up. In 1893, a third petition gathers 30,000 signatures . The bill passes, New Zealand is the first country in the world to grant women the vote.",

        "description": "Li'l Abner is a 1956 musical with a book by Norman Panama and Melvin Frank , music by Gene De Paul , and lyrics by Johnny Mercer . Based on the comic strip Li'l Abner by Al Capp , the show is, on the surface, a broad spoof of hillbillies , but it is also a pointed satire on other topics, ranging from American politics and incompetence in the United States federal government to propriety and gender roles .\n\nAfter several other writers and composers considered musicalizing the comic strip, Al Capp finally made a deal in 1955 with the eventual creators for a musical to be financed by Paramount Pictures , which wanted to follow the stage version with a film musical. The Broadway production opened on November 15, 1956, and ran for a moderately successful 693 performances. The score and Michael Kidd 's choreography received critical praise, but some critics felt that the book's adaptation lost the spirit of the comic strip. Kidd and Edie Adams , as Daisy Mae, won Tony Awards , while newcomer Peter Palmer , in the title role, won a Theatre World Award . Paramount released a film version with the same title in 1959 , with most of the Broadway cast reprising their roles.",
        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\n\"It's a Typical Day\" as the citizens of Dogpatch, U.S.A. go about their daily activities. As usual, sweet, curvaceous Daisy Mae Scragg is pursuing Li'l Abner Yokum who, despite being a strapping, handsome young man, isn't interested in girls or employment. Abner's domineering, diminutive Mammy sends Daisy Mae to tell Abner to come to the Cornpone Meetin' in the town square. At the fishing hole with his friends, Abner lazily reflects that if he could be anyone in the world, he'd rather be himself (\"If I had my Druthers\"). Daisy Mae tells the young men about the meeting, and they rush into town. Daisy is frustrated because Abner has failed to take any romantic interest in her (\"If I Had My Druthers\" (reprise)).\n\nThe townspeople assemble for the Cornpone Meetin', where parson Marryin' Sam leads a celebration of Dogpatch's founder, \"Jubilation T. Cornpone\", a bumbling Confederate general whose leadership was more beneficial to the North than to the South . Senator Fogbound, Dogpatch's U.S. congressman, tells the citizens that Congress has declared Dogpatch the most unnecessary town in the U.S., and so it must be evacuated to be used as a nuclear bomb test site to be overseen by Dr. Finsdale, a government scientist. Everyone is thrilled that Dogpatch has been picked out of the entire U.S. (\"Rag Offen the Bush\").\n\nBut Earthquake McGoon reminds them that if they leave Dogpatch, the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race won't take place: in Dogpatch, the only way anyone can be married is if a young woman catches a boy on Sadie Hawkins Day. Daisy Mae's sleazy unscrupulous relative, Romeo Scragg, gives Earthquake permission to marry Daisy Mae (in exchange for a $1 bribe). The townspeople decide to save Dogpatch and Sadie Hawkins Day by proving there is something necessary in the town. Daisy Mae asks Abner if he will let her catch him on Sadie Hawkins Day and tries to persuade him that he deserves to marry a girl like her, and Abner agrees that she should marry a boy like him (\"Namely You\"). The townspeople lament that their beloved home has been declared an \"Unnecessary Town\" as Dr. Finsdale declares all of their attempts to prove their worth were in vain.\n\nIt turns out that Mammy Yokum's Yokumberry Tonic, which she makes from the one-of-a-kind Yokumberry tree growing outside her home, is what has made Abner so strong and handsome.\n\nWhen a short, pudgy government scientist is given a spoonful, he turns into a tall, muscular man. Abner also agrees to go to Washington, accompanied by Marryin' Sam, to allow Dr. Finsdale and the government to test the tonic on the scrawny men of Dogpatch. There, greedy, tyrannical General Bullmoose wants to buy the formula for Yokumberry Tonic, and he is angry that Li'l Abner intends to turn the formula over to the government for free (\"What's Good for General Bullmoose\"). He hatches a dastardly scheme in which his girlfriend, femme fatale Appassionata Von Climax, will catch Abner on Sadie Hawkins Day. Once they're married, Bullmoose will kill Abner, and the formula will belong to his widow, Appassionata.\n\nAbner and Marryin' Sam return to Dogpatch with the happy news that \"The Country's In the Very Best of Hands\". On Sadie Hawkins Day, General Bullmoose and Appassionata arrive in Dogpatch. They hire Evil Eye Fleagle to help Appassionata catch Abner. The race begins, and the young women of Dogpatch pursue the young men (\"Sadie Hawkins Day\" ballet). Though Daisy Mae, with the help of Stupefyin' Jones (any man who looks at her freezes), almost succeeds in catching Abner, Evil Eye Fleagle uses his evil eye to freeze everyone in the race, and Appassionata calmly walks up to Abner and claims him as hers.\n\n### Act Two\n\nIn Washington, Dr. Finsdale and the scientists testing Yokumberry Tonic dream of a time when life will be totally controlled by science (\"Oh Happy Day\"). In Dogpatch, Daisy Mae concludes that the reason she couldn't win Abner is that she, at age seventeen, is too old and no longer beautiful, and Marryin' Sam joins her lament (\"I'm Past My Prime\"). Mammy Yokum has a vision in which she sees Bullmoose and Appassionata's plot to kill Li'l Abner. Daisy Mae asks Earthquake McGoon to go to Washington, D.C. to save Li'l Abner, promising to marry him if he does.\n\nIn Washington, an engagement party is being held for Li'l Abner and Appassionata. General Bullmoose has Evil Eye Fleagle on hand; since Fleagle's evil eye can require him to do anything requested, Appassionata won't even have to marry Abner to get the formula. The General is planning to simply have Fleagle use his eye on Abner, get the formula for Yokumberry Tonic, and then order Abner to commit suicide. Mammy and Pappy Yokum, Earthquake, Daisy Mae, and the ladies of Dogpatch all show up to sabotage the party. When Fleagle tries to use his evil eye on Abner, Earthquake holds up a mirrored serving tray to protect himself, and the beam from Fleagle's eye bounces off the tray and rebounds onto General Bullmoose. Mammy Yokum questions the General, and he reveals the entire plot. The police arrest him and Appassionata.\n\nThe women of Dogpatch go to the laboratory to see the results of Yokumberry Tonic. Their scrawny husbands have been transformed into handsome men, but they have no interest in their wives. Dr. Finsdale explains that this is an unfortunate side effect of the tonic: it kills men's romantic interests. The women beg for him to \"Put 'Em Back\" the way they were before they took the tonic. Daisy tells Abner that she's promised to marry Earthquake since he came to Washington and saved Abner, but she'd rather marry Abner (\"Namely You\" (reprise)). Softspoken Pappy Yokum tells Abner that he has a secret potion which will make Abner want to marry Daisy Mae. Abner agrees to take it once they get back to Dogpatch.\n\nBack in Dogpatch, Marryin' Sam is officiating at Daisy Mae and Earthquake's wedding. Before the wedding, Daisy introduces her filthy relatives to Earthquake, saying that they'll be coming to live with them once they are married. Marryin' Sam begins the ceremony by warning Earthquake of the potential consequences of marriage (\"The Matrimonial Stomp\"). Abner and Pappy interrupt the ceremony, and Abner takes the potion (Pappy whispers to Mammy that it's really just water) and declares that he wants to marry Daisy Mae. Earthquake now happily relinquishes Daisy Mae to marry Abner instead. Dr. Finsdale arrives, warning that the atomic bombs will arrive soon. As the townspeople try to move the town's statue of Jubilation T. Cornpone, a plaque bearing a declaration by Abraham Lincoln is revealed: because Cornpone's military blunders almost single-handedly allowed the North to win the Civil War , Dogpatch is designated a national shrine. Dr. Finsdale cancels the bombings, the scrawny men of Dogpatch return home to their happy wives, and the citizens of Dogpatch honor Jubilation T. Cornpone as Abner kisses Daisy Mae (Finale).",

        "description": "Seussical , sometimes Seussical the Musical , is a musical with lyrics by Lynn Ahrens , music by Stephen Flaherty , and a story co-written by both. It is based on the works of Dr. Seuss , with most of its plot drawing from Horton Hears a Who! , Gertrude McFuzz , and Horton Hatches the Egg . The title is a portmanteau of \"Seuss\" and \"musical\". Despite a negative critical reception and significant financial losses during its initial Broadway run in 2000, Seussical has since had a revival in popularity, with two US national tours, a West End production, and numerous adaptations for schools and regional theaters.",
        "synopsis": "This synopsis describes the tour version of the show, currently being licensed as \"Seussical the Musical\" by Music Theatre International (MTI) . Seussical weaves a story of friendship, loyalty, and love. Despite all odds, Horton and Gertrude band together to save the Whos, free Horton, and restore peace and unity to the Jungle of Nool! The charming story of Seussical teaches us the power of being unique, and the importance of fighting for your beliefs.\n\n### Act I\n\nThe show opens on a bare stage, with an odd red-and-white-striped hat in the center. A small boy wanders into view and notices the hat, wondering to whom it might belong. He finally mentions the word Cat in the Hat , who appears before the Boy and tells him he has been brought to life by the Boy's \" Thinks \". The Cat urges this boy to Think up the \"Seussian\" world and characters around the boy and himself (\"Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!\"). The Cat then reveals to the Boy that he is about to tell a story about someone as imaginative as the Boy is.\n\nTo begin the story, the Cat encourages the Boy to think up the Jungle of Nool, where Horton the Elephant is bathing. Horton hears a strange noise coming from a nearby speck of dust , and reasons that someone must be on it, calling out for help. He carefully places the speck on a soft clover and decides to guard it (\"Horton Hears a Who\"). But he is mocked mercilessly by the Sour Kangaroo and the other animals of the jungle, who do not believe him (\"Biggest Blame Fool\"). The only exceptions are Horton's bird neighbors, Gertrude McFuzz, who admires his compassion, and Mayzie LaBird, who is more concerned about herself (\"Biggest Blame Fool Playoff\").\n\nHorton soon discovers that the speck is actually a microscopic planet populated by creatures called Whos. The citizens of Who-ville introduce themselves and their yearly Christmas pageant directed by their friend the Grinch . They also reveal that in addition to being unable to control where the speck flies, they are on the brink of war and their entire population of Truffula Trees has been cut down (\"Here on Who\"). The Whos thank Horton and ask for his protection, and he agrees to guard their planet.\n\nAt this point, the Cat pushes the Boy into the story; he becomes Jojo, the son of the Mayor of Who-ville and his wife. Jojo has been getting into trouble at school for having Thinks, so his parents order him to \"take a bath and go to bed, and think some normal Thinks, instead\". Jojo blames the Cat for getting him into trouble and tries to send him away. The Cat refuses and persuades Jojo to imagine the tub is McElligot's Pool (\"It's Possible\"). Jojo inadvertently floods the house, leading the Mayor and his wife to contemplate what to do with their son (\"How to Raise a Child\"). When the Cat hands them a brochure, they decide to send Jojo to a military school run by General Genghis Khan Schmitz, who is preparing to go to war with those who eat their bread with the butter side down (\"The Military\"). While there, Jojo meets Horton, and finds a mutual friend in him (\"Alone in the Universe\").\n\nGertrude, meanwhile, has fallen in love with Horton, but is afraid he does not notice her because of her own tail, which consists of only \"one droopy-droop feather\" (\"The One Feather Tail of Miss Gertrude McFuzz\"). Mayzie advises her to take pills to make her tail grow more feathers, as she did to make her tail enormous, which is why she looks so dazzling. (\"Amayzing Mayzie\"). Gertrude is so excited that she overdoses, causing her tail to grow long and unwieldy (\"Amayzing Gertrude\").\n\nHorton is ambushed by the Wickersham brothers, a gang of delinquent monkeys, who steal the clover and make off with it (\"Monkey Around\"). Horton gives chase until the Wickershams hand the clover to an eagle named Vlad Vladikoff, who drops it into a large patch of identical clovers (\"Chasing the Whos\"). Here, the Cat cuts briefly into the action to remind the audience how lucky they are to not be Horton (\"How Lucky You Are\"). Undeterred, Horton begins to look for the clover, hoping the Whos are still alive, when Gertrude catches up with him and tries to get him to notice her new tail. Horton is too busy, so she leaves to take more pills (\"Notice Me, Horton\").\n\nHorton is about to search his three millionth clover when he loses hope. Mayzie, sitting in a nearby tree, offers to help him forget about the Whos by hatching an egg that she is too lazy to care for (\"How Lucky You Are (Reprise)\"). Horton reluctantly agrees, and Mayzie leaves for a vacation. Horton sits through months of harsh weather as he tries to decide between the egg and the Whos (\"Horton Sits on the Egg\") before he is captured by hunters, who take him away along with the entire tree. Gertrude tries to stop the hunters, but cannot fly due to her heavy tail.\n\nThe Cat closes the act with a reprise of \"How Lucky You Are\", and conducts the band during the intermission.\n\n### Act II\n\nHorton, still hatching the egg, is auctioned off to the traveling Circus McGurkus (\"Egg, Nest, and Tree\"/\"Circus McGurkus\"/\"How Lucky You Are (Reprise)\"). At one show in Palm Beach, he meets up with Mayzie, who insists that he keep the egg for himself before leaving (\"Amayzing Horton\"). Horton mourns the loss of the Whos and Jojo, but vows just as surely to protect the egg, as it, too, is alone without its mother (\"Alone in the Universe (Reprise)\"), and sings it a lullaby with Jojo about a magical place called Solla Sollew . At the same time, the Mayor and his wife begin to miss Horton and Jojo, and wish for Solla Sollew, as well (\"Solla Sollew\").\n\nJojo is with General Schmitz and his platoon as the Butter Battle commences (\"Transition to Butter Battle\"). Jojo deserts Schmitz, but sprints into a minefield and vanishes in an explosion. Schmitz assumes the worst and heads to Who-ville to tell Jojo's parents that their son has died (\"A Message from the Front\"). The Cat returns to perform a re-enactment of the dramatic scene. But in reality, Jojo has survived, but is lost with no idea of where to turn. The Cat appears to him with a band of Hunches , encouraging him to use his Thinks to find his way home (\"Havin' a Hunch\"). Jojo does so and happily reunites with his parents, who forgive him for his Thinks.\n\nGertrude sneaks into the circus to free Horton, explaining she plucked out all but one of her tail feathers to fly there, and confesses her love for him. She also reveals she has found his clover, delighting and relieving Horton to find the Whos alive and well (\"All for You\"). However, the Sour Kangaroo and the Wickersham brothers arrive to take Horton back to the jungle.\n\nIn the jungle, Horton is put on trial for the crimes of \"talking to a speck, disturbing the peace, and loitering... on an egg\" (\"The People Versus Horton the Elephant\"). Aided by Gertrude, Horton makes his best case, but Judge Yertle the Turtle finds him guilty. He orders Horton remanded to the \"Nool Asylum for the Criminally Insane\" and the clover destroyed in a kettle of hot \" Beezle-Nut \" oil. Desperate, Horton encourages the Whos to make as much noise as possible to prove their existence, but the animals do not hear them. Jojo finally uses his Thinks to conjure a new word, \"Yopp\", which he shouts loudly enough to reach the animals' ears. Convinced at last, the animals repent and promise to help protect the Whos, and Horton is acquitted. Jojo is accepted by his parents and the rest of Who-ville as \"Thinker Non-Stop\" for saving their planet. Horton's egg hatches into a tiny flying \"Elephant-Bird\", amazing everyone, but dismaying Horton, who panics at the thought of flying progeny. Gertrude reassures him that they can raise the child together, and they agree to do so.\n\nWith the story finished, the Cat returns to close the show (\"Finale - Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!\"), then vanishes along with the scenery, leaving only his hat and Jojo, who is now the Boy again. The Boy picks the hat up, dons it, and says, \"Seuss!\"\n\nDuring a curtain call , the company performs a number based on Green Eggs and Ham (\"Green Eggs and Ham\").",

        "title": "Man of La Mancha",
        "description": "Man of La Mancha is a 1965 musical with a book by Dale Wasserman , music by Mitch Leigh , and lyrics by Joe Darion . It is adapted from Wasserman's non-musical 1959 teleplay I, Don Quixote , which was in turn inspired by Miguel de Cervantes and his 17th-century novel Don Quixote . It tells the story of the \"mad\" knight Don Quixote as a play within a play, performed by Cervantes and his fellow prisoners as he awaits a hearing with the Spanish Inquisition . The work is not and does not pretend to be a faithful rendition of either Cervantes' life or Don Quixote . Wasserman complained repeatedly about people taking the work as a musical version of Don Quixote .\n\nThe original 1965 Broadway production ran for 2,328 performances and won five Tony Awards , including Best Musical. The musical has been revived four times on Broadway, becoming one of the most enduring works of musical theatre.\n\n\" The Impossible Dream \", the principal song in the show, became a standard . The musical has played in many other countries around the world, with productions in Croatian, Dutch, French (translation by Jacques Brel ), German, Hebrew, Irish, Estonian, Japanese, Korean, Bengali, Gujarati, Uzbek, Bulgarian, Hungarian, Serbian, Slovenian, Swahili, Swedish, Finnish, Chinese, Ukrainian, Turkish, and nine distinct dialects of the Spanish language.\n\nMan of La Mancha was first performed at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut , in 1965, and had its New York premiere on the thrust stage of the ANTA Washington Square Theatre in 1965.",
        "synopsis": "In the late sixteenth century, failed author-soldier-actor and tax collector Miguel de Cervantes has been thrown into a dungeon by the Spanish Inquisition , along with his manservant. They have been charged with foreclosing on a monastery. Their fellow prisoners attack them, eager to steal the contents of the large trunk Cervantes has brought with him. However, a sympathetic criminal known as \"the Governor\" suggests setting up a mock trial instead. Only if Cervantes is found guilty will he have to hand over his possessions. A cynical prisoner, known as \"the Duke,\" charges Cervantes with being an idealist and a bad poet. Cervantes pleads guilty, but then asks if he may offer a defense, in the form of a play, acted out by him and all the prisoners. The \"Governor\" agrees.\n\nCervantes takes out a makeup kit and costume from his trunk, and transforms himself into Alonso Quijano, an old gentleman who has read so many books of chivalry and thought so much about injustice that he has lost his mind and set out as a knight-errant . Quijano renames himself Don Quixote de La Mancha, and goes off to find adventures with his \"squire\", Sancho Panza. (\"Man of La Mancha (I, Don Quixote)\")\n\nDon Quixote warns Sancho that they are always in danger of being attacked by Quixote's mortal enemy, an evil magician known as the Enchanter. Suddenly he spots a windmill, mistakes it for a four-armed giant, attacks it, and receives a beating from the encounter. Quixote decides that he lost the battle because he was never properly knighted. He then mistakes a rundown inn for a castle and orders Sancho to announce their arrival by blowing his bugle.\n\nCervantes talks some prisoners into assuming the roles of the inn's serving wench and part-time prostitute Aldonza, and a group of muleteers who are propositioning her. Aldonza fends them off sarcastically (\"It's All The Same\"), but eventually deigns to accept their leader, Pedro, who pays in advance.\n\nDon Quixote enters with Sancho, asking for the lord of the castle. The Innkeeper (played by The Governor) humors Don Quixote as best he can. Quixote sees Aldonza and declares that she is his lady, Dulcinea, to whom he has sworn eternal loyalty (\"Dulcinea\"). Aldonza, used to rough treatment, is first flabbergasted and then annoyed at Quixote's kindness, and is further aggravated when the Muleteers turn Quixote's tender ballad into a mocking serenade.\n\nMeanwhile, Antonia, Don Quixote's niece, has gone with Quixote's housekeeper to seek advice from the local priest, who realizes that the two women are more concerned with the embarrassment Quixote's madness may bring them than with his actual welfare (\"I'm Only Thinking of Him\").\n\nCervantes chooses \"the Duke\" to play Dr. Sanson Carrasco, Antonia's fianc\u00e9, a man just as cynical and self-centered as the prisoner who is playing him. Carrasco is upset at the idea of marrying into the family of a madman, but the priest convinces Carrasco that it would be a worthy challenge to use his abilities to cure his prospective uncle-in-law. Carrasco and the priest set out to bring Don Quixote back home (\"I'm Only Thinking of Him [Reprise]\").\n\nBack at the inn, Sancho delivers a missive from Don Quixote to Aldonza courting her favor and asking for a token of her esteem. Aldonza provides the requested token: an old dishrag. She asks Sancho why he follows Quixote, but he can come up with no explanation other than \"I Really Like Him\". Alone, Aldonza ponders Quixote's behavior and her inability to laugh at him (\"What Do You Want of Me?\"). In the courtyard, the muleteers once again taunt Aldonza with a suggestive song (\"Little Bird, Little Bird\"). Pedro makes arrangements with her for an assignation later.\n\nThe priest and Dr. Carrasco arrive, but cannot reason with Don Quixote. Quixote becomes distracted by a barber who passes by the inn, wearing his shaving basin on his head to ward off the sun's heat (\"The Barber's Song\"). Quixote threatens the barber with a sword and snatches the basin, declaring it is the \"Golden Helmet of Mambrino \", which makes its wearer invulnerable. Dr. Carrasco and the priest leave, with the priest impressed by Don Quixote's view of life and wondering if curing him is really worthwhile (\"To Each His Dulcinea\").\n\nQuixote still wishes to be officially dubbed a knight: he plans to stand vigil all night over his armor in the inn's courtyard, and then have the Innkeeper (whom he mistakes for a nobleman) grant him knighthood the following morning. Aldonza encounters Quixote in the courtyard and confronts him; Quixote does his best to explain the ideals he follows and the quest he is on (\"The Impossible Dream\"). Pedro enters, furious at being kept waiting, and slaps Aldonza. Enraged, Don Quixote takes him and all the other muleteers on in a fight (\"The Combat\"). Don Quixote has no martial skill, but by luck and determination \u2013 and with the help of Aldonza and Sancho \u2013 he prevails, and the muleteers are all knocked unconscious. But the noise attracts the attention of the Innkeeper, who tells Quixote that he must leave. Quixote apologizes for the trouble but reminds the Innkeeper of his promise to dub him knight. The Innkeeper does so (\"Knight of the Woeful Countenance\").\n\nQuixote then declares that he must comfort the wounded muleteers, because chivalry requires kindness to one's enemies. Aldonza, impressed, says that she will help the muleteers instead. But when she comes to them with bandages, they beat her, rape her, and carry her off (\"The Abduction\"). Quixote, unaware of this, contemplates his recent victory and new knighthood (\"The Impossible Dream\" \u2013 first reprise).\n\nAt this point, the Don Quixote play is brutally interrupted when the Inquisition enters the dungeon and drags off an unwilling prisoner to be tried. The Duke taunts Cervantes for his look of fear, and accuses him of not facing reality. This prompts Cervantes to passionately defend his idealism.\n\nThe Don Quixote play resumes (\"Man of La Mancha\" \u2013 first reprise). Quixote and Sancho have left the inn and encounter a band of Gypsies (\"Moorish Dance\") who take advantage of Quixote's naivet\u00e9 and steal everything they own, including Quixote's horse Rocinante and Sancho's donkey Dapple. Quixote and Sancho are forced to return to the inn. Aldonza also shows up at the inn, bruised and ashamed. Quixote swears to avenge her, but she tells him off, flinging her real, pitiful history in his face and blaming him for allowing her a glimpse of a life she can never have. She begs him to see her as she really is but Quixote can only see her as his Dulcinea (\"Aldonza\").\n\nSuddenly, another knight enters. He announces himself as Don Quixote's mortal enemy, the Enchanter, in the form of the \"Knight of the Mirrors\". He insults Aldonza, so Quixote challenges him to combat. The Knight of the Mirrors and his attendants bear huge mirrored shields, and as they swing them at Quixote (\"Knight of the Mirrors\"), the glare blinds him. The Knight taunts Quixote, forcing him to see himself as the world sees him: a fool and a madman. Don Quixote collapses, weeping. The Knight of the Mirrors removes his helmet \u2013 he is really Dr. Carrasco, returned with his latest plan to cure Quixote.\n\nCervantes announces that the story is finished, but the prisoners are dissatisfied with the ending. They prepare to burn his manuscript when he asks for the chance to present one last scene. The governor agrees.\n\nQuixote is back at home, and has fallen into a coma. Sancho tries to cheer him up (\"A Little Gossip\"), and Alonso opens his eyes. He is now sane: he gives his name as Alonso Quijano and thinks his knightly career was just a dream. However, he feels close to death, and asks the priest to help him make out his will. Aldonza suddenly forces her way into the room. She has come to visit Quixote because she can no longer bear to be anyone but Dulcinea. When he does not recognize her, she sings a reprise of \"Dulcinea\" and tries to help him remember the words of \"The Impossible Dream.\" Suddenly, he remembers everything and rises from his bed, calling for his armor and sword so that he may set out again (\"Man of La Mancha\" \u2013 second reprise). But it is too late \u2013 in mid-song, he cries out and falls dead. The priest sings \"The Psalm\" ( Psalm 130 in Latin) for the dead. Sancho is distraught at his friend's death. Aldonza tries to comfort him, saying that Alonso Quijano may be dead but Don Quixote lives on. When Sancho addresses her as Aldonza, she replies, \"My name is Dulcinea.\"\n\nThe Inquisition enters to take Cervantes to his trial, and the prisoners, finding him not guilty, return his manuscript. It is his (as yet) unfinished novel, Don Quixote . As Cervantes and his servant mount the staircase to go to their impending trial, the prisoners, led by the girl who played Dulcinea, sing \"The Impossible Dream\" in chorus.",

        "title": "Showtune (musical)",
        "description": "Showtune is a musical revue celebrating the words and music of Broadway composer and lyricist Jerry Herman . Its title was inspired by Herman's autobiography of the same name. The revue's original title was Tune the Grand Up . After its 1985 San Francisco premiere and several regional productions through the 1990s, the piece played in the West End in 1998 under the title The Best of Times , and Off-Broadway in 2003, titled Showtune .\n\nThe forty songs featured in Showtune come from Herman's Broadway musicals Milk and Honey (1961), Hello, Dolly! (1964), Mame (1966), Dear World (1969), Mack & Mabel (1974), The Grand Tour (1979), A Day in Hollywood / A Night in the Ukraine (1980), and La Cage aux Folles (1983).\n\nConceived by Paul Gilger , the revue has no dialogue. Its songs are grouped into thematic scenes that tell stories and place a strong emphasis on Herman's lyrics and their optimistic messages. The song-cycle format creates dramatic sub-texts giving through-lines to the show.",
        "synopsis": "Act I\n\nHerman's optimistic view of show business life is presented in \"It's Today!\", the opening number from Mame , and \"Big Time\", from Mack and Mabel . On the other hand, \"We Need A Little Christmas\" and \"Put On Your Sunday Clothes!\" present his strategies for dealing with bad news and hard times. In the latter number, the cast simulates a train, with the men's bowler hats becoming smokestacks and the ladies' parasols acting as the wheels. Backstage at a Cabaret, an actor makes up as \"Zaza\" the star of La Cage Aux Folles! (\"A Little More Mascara\"). A crescent moon descends, and Zaza performs \"The Man in the Moon\". The cast sings \"I Am What I Am.\"\n\n\"The Four Seasons\" is the theme for Herman's outlook on love. Spring is represented by \"I Won't Send Roses\", \"Ribbons Down My Back\" and \"Dancing\"; summer is a battle of the sexes, with \"It Takes A Woman\" (men) \"Wherever He Ain't!\" (women), \"Hundreds of Girls\" (men) and \"So Long, Dearie\" (women); and autumn includes \"And I Was Beautiful\" and \"Kiss Her Now\" (While She's Young), with the two songs then given in counterpoint. During these numbers, the warring couples reconcile. Finally, in winter, the sequence is philosophical: Although \"Time Heals Everything\", one must act \"Before the Parade Passes By!\", and \"One Person\" can change the world, if he or she will \"Open a New Window\".\n\nAct II\n\nAs he thinks about the days of silent film, Mack Sennett recalls when \"Movies Were Movies\", and his love story is seen through the eyes of a cameraman who sings \"Look What Happened to Mabel\". Mabel dances a Charleston to \"That's How Young I Feel\". Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy perform \"My Best Girl\" on set for the umpteenth time, and she complains about his acting (\"Nelson\"). The company advises us to \"Just Go to the Movies\". A woman's unrequited love (\"It Only Takes a Moment\"), segues to a very pregnant Agnes Gooch who enters singing, \"It only took a moment\" and then her big number \"Gooch's Song\". A tap dancer encourages her to \"Tap Your Troubles Away\". Big production numbers for leading ladies follow: \"Hello, Dolly!\" and \"Mame\". The two divas sing \"Bosom Buddies\".\n\nA serious and romantic segment  follows, with \"I Don't Want to Know\", \"Song on the Sand\", \"Shalom\", \"I'll Be Here Tomorrow\", \"If He Walked Into My Life\" and \"I Promise You a Happy Ending\". These tender recollections yield to a big finale with a medley of production numbers \"Mame\", \"The Best of Times\" and a reprise of \"It's Today\".  The cast takes its bows singing \"Hello, Dolly!\" and asks the audience to join in.",

Lea Michele stepped into the lead role that September, with rave reviews prompting a new Broadway cast recording two months later.",
        "synopsis": "The musical is set in and around New York City just before and following World War I. Ziegfeld Follies star Fanny Brice, awaiting the return of her husband Nicky Arnstein from prison, reflects on their life together, and their story is told as a flashback.\n\n### Original Broadway version\n\nAct 1\n\nFanny is a stage-struck teen who gets her first job in vaudeville . Her mother and her mother\u2019s friend Mrs. Strakosh try to dissuade her from show business because Fanny is not the typical beauty (\"If a Girl Isn't Pretty\"). But Fanny perseveres (\" I'm the Greatest Star \") and is helped and encouraged by Eddie Ryan, a dancer she meets in the vaudeville shows. Once Fanny's career takes off, Eddie and Mrs. Brice lament that once she's on Broadway she'll forget about them (\"Who Taught Her Everything?\"). Fanny performs a supposedly romantic number in the Follies, but she turns it into a classic comic routine, ending the number as a pregnant bride (\"His Love Makes Me Beautiful\"), causing an uproar.\n\nShe meets the sophisticated and handsome Nick Arnstein, who accompanies Fanny to her mother's opening night party on \"Henry Street\". Fanny is clearly falling in love with Nick, while acknowledging their complex vulnerabilities (\" People \"). Later they meet in Baltimore and have a private dinner at a swanky restaurant and declare their feelings (\"You Are Woman, I Am Man\"). Fanny is determined to marry Nick, regardless of his gambling past (\" Don't Rain on My Parade \").\n\nAct 2\n\nThe two marry, move to a mansion on Long Island, and have a daughter, Frances (\"Sadie, Sadie\"). In the meantime, Mrs. Strakosh and Eddie suggest to Mrs. Brice that she should find a man to marry, now that her daughter is supporting her (\"Find Yourself a Man\"). Fanny has become a major star with the Ziegfeld Follies (\"Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat\"). Nick asks Ziegfeld to invest in a gambling casino, but although Ziegfeld passes, Fanny insists on investing. When the venture fails and they lose their money, Fanny tries to make light of it, which propels Nick to get involved in a shady bond deal, resulting in his arrest for embezzlement. Fanny feels helpless but stronger than ever in her love for him (\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\").\n\nIn the present, Fanny is waiting for Nick to arrive and has time to reflect on her situation. Nick arrives, newly released from prison, and he and Fanny decide to separate. She is heartbroken, but resolves to pick up her life again (\"Don't Rain on My Parade (Reprise)\").\n\n### 2022 Broadway revival\n\nAct 1\n\nIn the present, Fanny Brice sits in her dressing room whilst preparing to star in the Ziegfeld Follies , awaiting news to hear if her husband, Nicky Arnstein , has been freed from prison and reminiscing on her earlier life (\"Who Are You Now?\") In the past, Fanny is a stage-struck teen, though her mother and her mother\u2019s friends Mrs. Strakosh and Mrs. Meeker try to dissuade her from show business because Fanny is not the typical beauty (\"If a Girl Isn't Pretty\"). This is proved true when at her first vaudeville job as a chorus dancer, she is fired by the theater's owner, Tom Keeney. She confides to her friend Eddie Ryan, who got her the job, that she knows she will succeed (\" I'm the Greatest Star \"). Later, rehearsing with Eddie to re-audition for Keeney, Mrs. Brice echos Fanny's point (\"I'm the Greatest Star (Reprise)\") and Fanny revolves to audition again for Keeney. After \"Eddie's Tap,\" Fanny nervously performs her first number \"Cornet Man,\" though eventually, she wins over the audience and the attention of handsome gambler, Nicky Arnstein, who is able to wager Keeney a higher pay for Fanny and gives her his card.\n\nA year later, Fanny receives a telegram from Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. asking her to meet him at his theater , which Fanny proposes is connected to her interaction with Nick. At the theater, Fanny argues with Ziegfeld over his song choice for her but is forced to perform the song. However, she turns the supposedly romantic number, \"His Love Makes Me Beautiful,\" into a comedy in which she portrays a pregnant bride. Backstage, Fanny's family and friends are thrilled but Ziegfeld reprimands her to which she apologizes, though he admits he found the act funny. Nick appears backstage, congratulating Fanny on her performance, and escorts her home (\"I Wanna Be Seen With You Tonight\") where her mother and close friends have thrown her a party, celebrating her success (\"Henry Street\"). Later in the evening, Fanny opens up to Nick about her desire to find love (\" People \"), and Nick admits that he would initiate a relationship between them, but acknowledges that he is leaving New York the next day.\n\nSometime later, Fanny is touring with the follies and she and Nick both find themselves in Baltimore. Nick brings her to dinner at a fancy establishment, where she panics in response to his somewhat rapid advances, though she eventually gives in (\" You Are Woman, I Am Man \"). Later, the follies company is preparing to leave Cleveland and Fanny and Nick appear arm in arm. However, he tells her he will not be following the company, as he has to win back his money in Monte Carlo. He tells her he loves her but when she asks him to marry her, he insists that they cannot wed until he is rich again. In a last minute decision, she decides that she needs to follow him in pursuit of marriage, no matter what it means for her career (\" Don't Rain on my Parade \").\n\nAct 2\n\nFanny surprises Nick in Monte Carlo (\"Entr'acte\"/\"Don't Rain on my Parade (Reprise)\"). He tells her that he has won back his wealth and the two are married and move to a mansion on Long Island, with Fanny soon revealing that she is pregnant (\"Sadie, Sadie\"). Back on Henry Street (\"Sadie, Sadie (Playoff)\"), Mrs. Brice and Eddie lament that Fanny no longer needs them (\"Who Taught Her Everything She Knows?\"). A few months later, as Fanny prepares to go back to rehearsals for a new show, Nick abruptly tells her that he is heading to Philadelphia to find investors for a casino he's building in Miami. Fanny reacts badly, nervous about leaving their daughter, Frances, for a whole day, though Nick promises that he will only be gone for a day, but in the end, she convinces him to stay and she is welcomed back to the theater (\"You Are Woman (Reprise)\"/\"Henry Street (Reprise)\"). Nick follows her to the theater and attempts to convince Ziegfeld to invest in his project, but Ziegfeld dismisses him. In response, Fanny decides to invest $68,000 of her money into Nick's project. Over the next few days, Nick travels to Florida and enters in a series of business deals with Fanny's money (\"Temporary Arrangement\").\n\nOn Fanny's opening night for her new show, she anxiously waits Nick's arrival, who is still traveling, telling Eddie that this would be the first opening night of hers he has missed. After her performance (\"Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat\"), Fanny's mother comforts her before Nick appears in her dressing room, revealing that a hurricane in Florida has destroyed the casino and lost them their money. She assures him that they will rebuild their success and that the most important thing to her is him (\"Who Are You Now? (Reprise)\"/\"People (Reprise)\"). The following year, Nick is involved in a business proposal to become a partner at a talent agency without putting up any money, though he sees through the act and realizes that Fanny has put up the money on their behalf. Nick reacts badly, insisting that he does not need her help to succeed and calls about a mob deal he was informed about, agreeing to join the deal in exchange for $68,000 (\"You're a Funny Girl/Beekman Call\"). Back at the follies, Fanny prepares a new routine (\"What Do Happy People Do?\"), but her mother arrives to inform her that Nick has been arrested for embezzlement. When Fanny insists that Nick couldn't have known the deal was faulty, her mother calls her out for making him feel unimportant in her life. Alone, Fanny reflects on how important he is to her (\"The Music That Makes Me Dance\").\n\nFlashing back to the present, (\"Dream Ballet\"), three years after the arrest, Fanny and Eddie share one last tender moment as Nick appears in the doorway. She insists that she's willing to change to make their relationship better but he abruptly asks her for a divorce. She is taken aback but thanks him for making her feel \"almost, sorta...beautiful.\" He assures her that she is beautiful, then leaves. Fanny somberly reflects on their marriage (\"Funny Girl\") but as she is called to the stage, she resolves to start again, stating \"That's life in the theatre!\" (\"Don't Rain on my Parade (Reprise II)\").",

The novel represents Twain's first attempt at historical fiction . The plot concerns the accession of nine-year-old Edward VI of England in 1547 and his interactions with look-alike Tom Canty , a London pauper who lives with his abusive, alcoholic father.",
        "synopsis": "Tom Canty , the youngest child of a very poor family living in Offal Court, located in London , England , has been abused by his father and his grandmother but is encouraged by the local priest , who taught him to read and write. Loitering around the Palace of Westminster gates one day, Tom sees Edward Tudor , the Prince of Wales . Coming too close in his intense excitement, he is caught and nearly beaten by the royal guards. However, Edward stops them and invites Tom into his palace chamber. There, the two boys get to know one another and are fascinated by each other's lives. They have an uncanny resemblance to each other and learn they were even born on the same day, so they decide to swap clothes \"temporarily\". Edward hides an item, which the reader later learns is the Great Seal of England , and goes outside to confront the guards who abused Tom; however, dressed as Tom, he is not recognized by the guards, who drive him from the palace.\n\nTom, dressed as Edward, tries to cope with court customs and manners after being mistaken for the prince. Edward's father, King Henry VIII , his fellow nobles, and the palace staff think the prince has an illness that has caused memory loss and fear he will go mad . After King Henry dies, Tom is repeatedly asked about the missing Great Seal of England, but he knows nothing about it. However, when Tom is asked to sit in on judgments, his common-sense observations reassure them that his mind is sound.\n\nEdward eventually finds his way through the streets to the Canty home, where the Canty family believes him to be Tom. There, he is subjected to the brutality of Tom's alcoholic father, from whom he manages to escape, and meets Miles Hendon, a soldier and nobleman returning from war. Although Miles does not believe Edward's claims to royalty, he humors him and becomes his protector. Meanwhile, news reaches them that King Henry has died and Edward has become king.\n\nAs Edward experiences the brutal life of a London pauper firsthand, he becomes aware of the stark class inequality in England. In particular, he sees the harsh, punitive nature of the English judicial system, under which people are burned at the stake, pilloried, and flogged. He realizes that the accused are convicted on flimsy evidence and branded or hanged for petty offenses, and he vows to reign with mercy when he regains his rightful place. When Edward declares to a gang of thieves that he is the king and will put an end to unjust laws, they assume he is insane and hold a mock coronation .\n\nAfter a series of adventures, including a stint in prison, Edward interrupts the coronation as Tom is about to be crowned king. The nobles are shocked at their resemblance but refuse to believe that Edward is the rightful king wearing Tom's clothes until he produces the Great Seal of England that he hid before leaving the palace. Edward and Tom switch back to their original places, and Edward is crowned King Edward VI of England. Miles is rewarded with the rank of Earl and the family right to sit in the king's presence. In gratitude for supporting the new king's claim to the throne, Edward names Tom the \"King's Ward\", a privileged position he holds for the rest of his life. The novel ends stating that Tom lived a long life, although it would have been unlikely for both of them to survive the reign of Mary I , while Edward died at the age of 15.",

He says that he is writing his memoirs on the eve of his possible execution, and that his story could be called \"A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder\". He begins his story.\n\nIn 1907, Monty is living in a shabby Clapham flat and his mother, a washerwoman, has just died. Miss Marietta Shingle, a mysterious old woman, arrives to tell Monty that his mother was, in fact, a member of the aristocratic D'Ysquith family. Isabel D'Ysquith had eloped with a Castilian musician (now also deceased), which caused her family to disown her. Wishing to spare her son any shame, Isabel never told him the truth of his ancestry. Now, Miss Shingle says, Monty is ninth in line to inherit the earldom of Highhurst. She insists that he take his rightful place in the family (\"You're A D'Ysquith\"). Monty writes a letter to Lord Asquith D'Ysquith Sr., the head of the D'Ysquith family banking house, explaining his connection to the family and inquiring if there might be a job available for him.\n\nMonty is in love with Miss Sibella Hallward, but she will not marry him due to his poverty (\"I Don't Know What I'd Do\"). Sibella has also drawn the attention of another gentleman of higher status, Lionel Holland. She dubiously accepts Monty's story about his lineage, but remarks that eight people would have to die in order for him to become earl.\n\nMonty receives a reply from Lord Asquith's son, Asquith D'Ysquith Jr., denying Isabel's existence and warning Monty against contacting the family again or using their name. Monty is dejected, but refuses to accept his apparent destiny as a poor commoner (\"Foolish to Think\"). He takes a tour of Highhurst Castle, the D'Ysquiths' ancestral home, on Visitors Day, where the spirits of his D'Ysquith ancestors admonish him that he does not belong there (\"A Warning to Monty\"). Lord Adalbert D'Ysquith, the current Earl of Highhurst, catches Monty looking around the ancestral library and drives him out, expressing his disdain for the commoners flooding his home (\"I Don't Understand the Poor\").\n\nMonty decides to try his luck with the clergyman in the family, a dithering old man named the Reverend Lord Ezekial D'Ysquith. Ezekial gives Monty a tour of the ancestral family church. He remembers Isabel as a charming girl who broke her father's heart, but refuses to advocate on Monty's behalf, believing that it is best to avoid family intrigue. Monty and Ezekial ascend the bell tower, where Ezekial nearly loses his balance, thanks to a gusty wind and his own inebriation. Monty realizes how easy it would be to let Ezekial fall, exacting revenge for his mother and bringing him one step closer to the earldom (\"Foolish to Think (Reprise)\"). Rather than assisting Ezekial to safety, Monty lets him fall to his death.\n\nMonty returns to his dead-end job as a clerk, frustrated that he toils away while unworthy men grow rich, including Asquith D'Ysquith Jr. He observes Asquith Jr. and his mistress Miss Evangeline Barley, a recent Florodora girl, steal away to a winter resort. Monty follows them with the intention of poisoning Asquith Jr., but is unable to get close enough to deliver the poison. Asquith Jr. and Miss Barley go ice-skating on a frozen lake, and Monty is struck by inspiration. He cuts a hole in the ice, and the skaters fall through and drown (\"Poison in My Pocket\").\n\nMonty returns to London and receives a letter from Lord Asquith D'Ysquith Sr., apologizing for the tone of his son's letter and inviting Monty to the bank to speak about a job. He is grief-stricken by his son's death in the skating \"accident\", and offers Monty a comfortable salary and a job as a stockbroker. Monty accepts.\n\nSibella informs Monty that she is engaged to marry Lionel Holland. Upon learning of Monty's new position and income, she begins to reconsider, but forces herself to go through with marrying Lionel (\"Poor Monty\").\n\nMonty now fixes on his distant cousin Henry D'Ysquith, a country squire. He encounters Henry in a town pub and rescues him from an assault by a foreclosed-on tenant. Henry is married but clearly prefers the company of men; Monty picks up on this and befriends him (\"Better With a Man\"). Henry is also an avid beekeeper, and tells Monty that a person can be killed by an excess of bee-stings. Monty obtains a bottle of lavender perfume, to which bees are extraordinarily attracted. At the D'Ysquith country estate in Salisbury , Monty douses Henry's beekeeping clothes with the lavender before introducing himself to Henry's sister, Miss Phoebe D'Ysquith. As she and Monty discover their similarities, Henry is stung to death (\"Inside Out\"). Monty consoles Phoebe, and concludes that since he cannot be with Sibella, she would be the perfect woman to be his countess when he becomes earl. As a woman of his own generation, she does not stand before him in the line of succession, and she is highly sympathetic to the plight of his mother.\n\nThere are other women who do come before Monty in the lineage, including Lady Hyacinth D'Ysquith, an unmarried woman of a certain age, who devotes herself to philanthropic causes, primarily with the aim of bolstering her own social position. Posing as a member of the Foreign Office, Monty encourages Lady Hyacinth to travel first to war-torn Egypt, then to a leper colony in India, in order to dispose of her. She returns unharmed both times, before Monty sends her to an African jungle where a cannibal tribe lives. Lady Hyacinth is reported missing and presumed dead (\"Lady Hyacinth Abroad\").\n\nMonty proves a talented stockbroker, securing a significant salary increase and praise from Lord Asquith D'Ysquith Sr. (\"The Last One You'd Expect - Part I\"). His romance with Sibella continues despite her marriage and it is clear that she is impressed by Monty's determination to succeed (\"The Last One You'd Expect - Part III\").\n\nMonty's next target is Major Lord Bartholomew D'Ysquith, a staunch eugenicist , vegetarian and bodybuilder. Monty encounters Lord Bartholomew at a weight-lifting hall and charms his way into acting as the major's spotter on the bench-press apparatus. Pretending to misunderstand his cries for help, Monty adds more weight than Bartholomew can hold, and then allows the barbell to fall and decapitate him.\n\nMonty continues to console Phoebe; actions that during her period of mourning for her brother have endeared him to her greatly (\u201cThe Last One You'd Expect - Part V\").\n\nLady Salome D'Ysquith Pumphrey is an appallingly bad actress currently starring in a production of Henrik Ibsen 's Hedda Gabler . Remembering that the play ends with Hedda's suicide by a pistol shot to the head, Monty sneaks backstage and loads the prop gun with real bullets. Lady Salome shoots herself and dies, to the shock of her fellow actors and the approval of the audience.\n\nThe deaths of the Reverend Lord Ezekial, Asquith Jr., Henry, Lady Hyacinth, Major Lord Bartholomew, and Lady Salome now leave only two D'Ysquiths in the way: the present earl Lord Adalbert, and Lord Asquith Sr., Monty's employer and benefactor. Monty is suddenly conflicted, finding he has no desire to murder the kindly Lord Asquith, but is let off the hook when the old man suddenly succumbs to a heart attack (\"The Last One You'd Expect - Part VIII\"). As Lord Adalbert realizes that there is no one left between him and Monty, all of London is abuzz over the dashing young gentleman who's risen so far, so fast, and now stands next in line to inherit Highhurst (\"The Last One You'd Expect - Part IX\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe curtain rises on Lord Asquith Sr.'s funeral. Monty delivers a stirring eulogy, but the assembled mourners are irritated at the endless string of D'Ysquith memorials they are compelled to attend (\"Why Are All the D'Ysquiths Dying?\"). Lord Adalbert worries that the curse that has fallen upon his family may strike him next (\"Why Are All the D'Ysquiths Dying? (Reprise)\").\n\nMonty and Sibella continue their affair; he continues to love her despite his awareness of her flaws (\"Sibella\"). Sibella says that while she is unhappy with Lionel, she doesn't necessarily regret marrying for self-interest, and wouldn't begrudge Monty for doing the same. However, she would \"forbid\" him to marry for love. She also asks if Monty can secure Lionel an invitation to Highhurst, as he has political aspirations. Phoebe unexpectedly arrives, and Sibella hides in the next room. Phoebe declares her intention to marry Monty, even if the D'Ysquiths would look down on them. Monty accepts, but knows he is caught both figuratively and literally between the two women (\"I've Decided to Marry You\").\n\nMonty is shocked to discover that Lady Hyacinth has survived her encounter with the cannibals and is returning to London. As she disembarks the ship, Monty uses an axe to cut the supports of the gangplank. It collapses, and she drowns in the harbor.\n\nMonty, Phoebe, Sibella, and Lionel are all invited to Highhurst for the weekend, so that Lord Adalbert can meet his heir. Monty and Phoebe arrive first, and meet the earl and his wife, Lady Eugenia D'Ysquith. The spirits of the D'Ysquith ancestors again warn Monty against presuming above his station (\"Final Warning\"). A long-brewing enmity between Lord Adalbert and Lady Eugenia is evident, and Adalbert makes several crass remarks about the scandal caused by Monty's mother. He and Monty head off to look at \"some of the weapons that killed our ancestors\" as Sibella arrives without Lionel, who's been  called away for urgent business. Phoebe and Monty's engagement is news to Sibella. She begs him to break it off and declares that she loves him. Although he still loves her, he angrily replies that it is too late for her to claim ownership of him and that he will proceed with marrying Phoebe.\n\nAt dinner, a truly awful meal is served, and Lord Adalbert and Lady Eugenia bicker constantly. Monty has brought along poison, intending to slip it into Lord Adalbert's food, but cannot do so unnoticed (\"Poison in My Pocket (Reprise)\"). Miss Shingle, who initially brought Monty the news of his true lineage, appears; it turns out that she's been employed as a servant by the D'Ysquiths for 39 years.\n\nAt last, Monty slips poison into Lord Adalbert's dessert, but to his horror, the earl refuses it, insisting Sibella eat it instead; Monty desperately knocks it to the floor. A drunken Lord Adalbert starts to tell the story of how he was betrayed by his valet during the Boer War (\"Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun\"). He gives Monty his loaded army rifle, and demands that he play the part of the valet, ordering Monty to aim the gun at him. Monty cannot bring himself to shoot the earl, and lowers the gun, his opportunity lost. Lord Adalbert takes a drink and, to Monty's surprise, suddenly drops dead.\n\nWith Lord Adalbert's death, Monty is now Lord Montague D'Ysquith Navarro, Ninth Earl of Highhurst. He and Phoebe marry soon after. However, at the wedding reception, Chief Inspector Pinckney of Scotland Yard arrests him for the murder of Lord Adalbert, who, it has been discovered, was poisoned. Monty remarks on the absurdity of being charged with the one murder he didn't actually commit (\"Stop! Wait! What?!\").\n\nA trial is held before the House of Lords , and evidence is given to both implicate and exculpate Monty. Sibella testifies on Monty's behalf, but, in a fit of passion, gives evidence that bolsters the prosecution's alleged motive for the crime: that the D'Ysquiths disinherited his mother and denied his existence.\n\nOn the evening before the jury is to render judgment, Monty is writing his memoirs in his cell and strikes up a conversation with the jail's custodian, Chauncey. It turns out that Chauncey is a D'Ysquith too, his father having been a black sheep of the family, cast out in a manner similar to Isabel. Chauncey says he doesn't mind having not been acknowledged - he has none of the advantages of the D'Ysquiths, but none of their troubles either. Moved by the encounter, Monty shakes the hand of his last remaining relation.\n\nConvinced of Monty's innocence, Phoebe visits him in jail. They conclude that an unseen providence is watching over him, but Phoebe has one important question to ask him: is Sibella in love with him? She takes his silence as an answer, and departs. Monty concludes his memoir, saying that the outcome will be revealed in the morning with the jury's verdict.\n\nSibella arrives at the jail with a letter, purportedly from Phoebe and addressed to Monty, confessing to poisoning the earl so that Monty could take his rightful place. Phoebe returns to the jail with another letter, this one apparently from Sibella and also addressed to Monty, confessing the same thing. Both women plead for the other to be arrested and Monty set free. The authorities decide that both women appear equally culpable, and they can't convict one woman if they believe the other one guilty. Phoebe and Sibella have also provided reasonable doubt as to Monty's guilt. It becomes apparent to the audience that the two women have thus conspired to prevent Monty's conviction and execution (\"That Horrible Woman\").\n\nMonty is awakened and, to his great surprise, set free. Cheering crowds greet him outside. Phoebe and Sibella are there, evidently content to share him between them. Monty suddenly panics realizing that he's left his memoirs, which contain a full confession, in his cell. However, a guard hands Monty the journal, saying he found it and thought Monty might need it. Reeling from this one last stroke of luck, Monty wonders who poisoned the earl, if he didn't. Miss Shingle appears, and confesses to the audience that it was she who slipped prussic acid into the earl's port. In the final moments of the show, the company sing \"this is not the end\", and Chauncey appears, holding a small bottle of poison, singing \"Poison in My Pocket,\" implying that he will use it on Monty (\"Finale\").\n\nAfter the curtain call, Monty hands Chauncey a poisonous belladonna flower. Chauncey eats it, grimaces, and exits the stage.",

        "title": "Never Forget (musical)",
        "description": "Never Forget is a jukebox musical with a book written by Guy Jones and Ed Curtis, with screenwriter Danny Brocklehurst acting as story advisor, based on the 1990s songs of boy band Take That , written by Gary Barlow . In addition to Barlow's songs, Never Forget features additional music and lyrics by Barry Manilow , Dan Hartman and Adrienne Anderson , all of which were covered by Take That in the 1990s. The musical's story focuses on the themes of friendship , ambition, love and betrayal among the members of a Take That tribute band, but it is not related to the history of Take That. The musical is named after Take That's chart-topping single \" Never Forget \".\n\nThe musical Never Forget premiered at the Wales Millennium Centre , Cardiff , in July 2007 prior to a short UK tour. The show was nominated for the 2008 WOS Theatregoers Choice Award for Best Touring Production and received generally favourable notices.  It then re-opened at The Churchill Theatre , Bromley , London, in March 2008 for a second six-city pre- West End tour.\n\nThe musical began previews on 7 May 2008 at the Savoy Theatre in London and officially opened on 21 May 2008 to generally favourable reviews.  The tours and West End production were both directed by Ed Curtis and choreographed by Karen Bruce .  The set design was by Bob Bailey, lighting design by James Whiteside, sound design by Richard Brooker and costume design by Christopher Woods.  The production closed at the Savoy on 15 November 2008. [ citation needed ]\n\nThe original touring production is available on DVD, filmed on the press night at Manchester Opera House .",
        "synopsis": "The plot of Never Forget has been through several incarnations since the initial workshop production which toured the UK in 2007. Each version of the script is deliberately different in order to update the setting of the show. When the original production played, Take That had just reformed and the show referenced this. In more recent productions, the characters have noted the success the boyband have seen since their comeback.\n\n### Act 1\n\nAsh Sherwood is a struggling singer-songwriter in Manchester, England, with dreams of making it big. He proposes to his girlfriend Chloe and, to his surprise, she accepts (\" Could It Be Magic \"), and the couple's engagement party follows. Ash's mum's pub , 'The Three Bells' is under threat due to mounting debt, and Ash needs to raise money quickly. Taking a desperate chance, Ash and his best friend, Jake Turner (Chloe's older brother), decide to audition for a tribute band set to be entered into the lucrative ' Battle of the Tribute Bands ' competition.  Holding the auditions is Ron Freeman, an eccentric but hard-nosed band manager. With money problems of his own, Ron is looking for a group of lads he can mould into the ultimate Take That tribute band .\n\nAt the audition (\" Pray \"), the band come together as Ash and Jake are joined by three others: Adrian Banks, an introverted bank manager trying to win back his adulterous wife; Dirty Harry, a dim but endearing stripper who is desperate to escape the world of stripping; and Jose Reize, a Spaniard come to England in search of fame and fortune , and happy to escape from his overbearing mother. Once Ron chooses the band members, rehearsals begin, and the boys are joined by their new choreographer and backing dancers (\"Pray\" (reprise)). In her dark and empty pub, Babs Sherwood has just received her final eviction notice. She reminisces over her years spent behind the bar (\" Never Forget \"). Ash promises Babs that he will save the pub with his competition winnings (if they win). Chloe, immersed in wedding magazines, wants the perfect wedding. Babs tries to convince Ash that it is too late for the pub, and the money would be better spent on the wedding.\n\nThe following day at the gym, the boys are working out with their choreographer and backing dancers . Jake tries to hit on the choreographer, who is not best pleased with the bands progress in the rehearsal room; she turns on him and calls the band amateurs . The argument between the band members and choreographer turns into a 'dance off' between the boys and the backing dancers (\" Take That & Party \"). Ron enters the gym's changing room to discover the boys messing around, and he lectures them about dedication. He makes them sign his contract and relays the news that they are scheduled to perform a 'practice gig' the next night at a local pub in Salford.\n\nThe following evening, back stage at the pub, Ron gives the band his pre show pep talk and inspires them with stories of \"World Ruddy Domination\". Ron takes Ash aside to tell him that there will be somebody special watching the performance. On stage at the pub, the boys lose their confidence in front of the audience, and the other four leave Ash alone to begin the number (\" Babe \"). Inspired by Ash's performance, the others regain their confidence and join Ash on stage. Ron and Annie Borrowman, Ron's record-producer friend, watch the performance from the sidelines. After the performance, they take Ash aside and offer him a special contract \u2013 a solo deal. Ash tells Chloe about the offer, vowing to try to talk Annie into taking the rest of the group as well.\n\nOn Ash's Stag Night , whilst queuing outside the Salsa Bar, Ash and his friends bump into Chloe and her friends out for her Hen Night. Ash's mum forces them to combine the 2 parties inside the club (\" It Only Takes a Minute \"). Ron and Annie turn up for the party, and Chloe discovers that Annie is after more than just Ash's talent. Ash is unable to convince Annie to take on any of the other boys as part of her special deal. A jealous Chloe throws her drink at Annie.  Outside the club, Chloe and Ash argue over Annie and the special deal. Chloe shouts \" Do What You Like \", leaving Ash alone to make his choice: loyalty to his friends and fianc\u00e9e or his solo career.\n\nThe next day, at the Three Belles Pub, Chloe tells her brother and the rest of the group about Annie's secret offer. Ash enters and is forced to tell them that he has decided to take Annie's offer, which could lead to stardom, and to leave the boys and their tribute band behind. The rest of the band leave Chloe and Ash behind in disgust. Chloe is upset, and after another argument calls off the engagement . Ash is left alone with his thoughts and wanders in the rain (\" Back for Good \"). Ash and Chloe are unable to resolve their differences. The rest of the band and the crowd returns (\"Never Forget\" (reprise)) and the rain stops.\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe front cloth flies out to reveal the four remaining band members tap dancing to the tune of (\" I Found Heaven \"), but there is a space where Ash should be, as the four boys carry on without him. In a backstage dressing room, Chloe decides to join the group to fill in Ash's missing space. The four boys, happy with that resolution, decide to visit Ash to make peace. In the TV studio, Ash is busy rehearsing his own number with his new dancers under the scrutinising eye of Annie (\"Every Guy\"). The four boys enter, interrupting the rehearsal to speak to Ash, and Annie reluctantly gives them five minutes. During this time the boys make up, but Harry accidentally lets on that Chloe has replaced Ash in their band. Ash is struck with a sudden pang of jealousy.\n\nAfter the rehearsal is finished, Annie decides to take Ash out for a quiet drink to discuss his career. The 'drink' ends in a seedy pole dancing club where Annie seduces Ash (\" Once You've Tasted Love \"). The next morning, Chloe appears at Ash's flat in Manchester to try to resolve their problems. Annie appears in the doorway inside half dressed.  Chloe flees, distraught, and wanders off into the streets of Manchester (\" Love Ain't Here Anymore \").\n\nIn Ash's backstage dressing room, he is preparing to go on stage to perform his own entry in the 'Battle of the Bands' competition. His mum gives him a 'right good telling off' for the way he has treated Chloe, when Annie enters to tell Ash he should be warming up. Babs and Annie have a massive argument, during which Annie reveals that the money he was expecting for his deal actually went to Ron to Buy him out of his previous contract. Babs finally tells Ash he is too late to save the pub as it has gone. They leave Ash alone, but when Ron enters, Ash throws him to the ground in a heated rage before storming off. Ron is left alone with his own thoughts (\" Never Forget \").\n\nIn the band's dressing room, the four boys are preparing to go on stage to perform their number for the competition. Ash joins them and wants to make amends; he decides to break his deal with Annie and re-join his friends in their tribute band. They agree to accept him back. Chloe arrives to discover that they have let Ash back into the band without her approval, and she storms off. On The Battle of the Bands concert stage, the final act is announced. Amidst spectacular flames, the band perform (\" Relight My Fire \"), with Chloe reluctantly taking on the role made famous by Lulu . After the performance, the competition winners are announced, with the band a winner. Ron joins the band on stage to apologise for selling Ash off to Annie. Ash forgives him, and they all leave a happy Ron on stage with his trophy .\n\nOutside the concert hall, Ash chases after Chloe, wanting to make things right, and they reconcile (\" A Million Love Songs \"). Later, at the church where wedding guests are arriving, the children's choir and priest are on the pulpit. Ash and Chloe enter and walk up the isle under a trumpet fanfare of \" Never Forget \". The children's choir sing as the couple are married, and after the ceremony is complete, all join in.",

        "description": "Once on This Island is a coming-of-age one-act stage musical with a book and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and music by Stephen Flaherty . It is based on the 1985 novel My Love, My Love; or, The Peasant Girl by Rosa Guy , a Caribbean -set retelling of Hans Christian Andersen 's fairy tale The Little Mermaid . It concerns a peasant girl in the French Antilles who falls in love with a rich boy and makes a deal with the gods to save his life.\n\nThe original Broadway production ran from 1990 to 1991, and the West End production opened in 1994, where it won the 1995 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical . The musical was revived on Broadway in a production that opened on December 3, 2017 at the Circle in the Square Theatre . The revival was showered with critical acclaim, with New York Times critic Jesse Green describing it as \"ravishing\" and The Huffington Post praising it for creating \"an aesthetic experience unlike anything seen on Broadway.\" It won the 2018 Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical .\n\nA Disney film adaptation is currently in development for Disney+ .",
        "synopsis": "One stormy night in the Antilles archipelago, thunder booms, making a small girl cry in fear. To comfort her, the village storytellers tell her the story of Ti Moune, a peasant girl who falls in love with a grand homme , Daniel Beauxhomme \u2013 a story of life, pain, love, grief, faith, and hope. In this story, four gods (consisting of Asaka : Mother of the Earth, Agw\u00e9 : god of Water, Erzulie : goddess of Love, and Papa Ge : demon of Death) rule an island known as the Jewel of the Antilles where poor peasants worship them (Prologue/\"We Dance\"). The peasants, \"black as night\", live on one side of the island, and the grands hommes , lighter-skinned descendants of the original French planters and their slaves, live on the other. One night, Agwe unleashes a terrible storm upon the island, which in turn causes a disastrous flood, wiping out many villages. However, the gods save the life of a little orphan named Ti Moune by placing her in a tree above the flood's waves. She is found and subsequently adopted by the peasants Mama Euralie and Tonton Julian (\"One Small Girl\").\n\nYears afterwards, a grown-up Ti Moune prays to the gods to let her know her purpose, and to let her be like the fast-driving strangers on the roads near her village - the grands hommes (\"Waiting for Life\"). Hearing her plea, the gods laugh at her. However, Erzulie suggests that they give her love, because it is stronger than any of the other elements. Offended, Papa Ge proposes a bet to prove which is stronger: love or death. Agwe arranges for the car of Daniel Beauxhomme, a young grand homme , to crash during a storm so that Ti Moune may meet Daniel and restore him to health (\"And the Gods Heard Her Prayer/Rain\"). Despite the objections of the other peasants including her own parents, Ti Moune helps the intruder recover (\"Pray\"). Ti Moune falls in love with the stranger and as she cares for the unconscious boy, she imagines he loves her too. When Papa Ge comes to take Daniel's life, Ti Moune offers her life in exchange for Daniel's so that he will not die (\"Forever Yours\"). Papa Ge is angry but leaves, hinting he will return \u2013 sooner or later, as her life now belongs to him.\n\nTonton Julian travels to the other side of the Island to seek Daniel's family at the Hotel Beauxhomme. When he returns, he brings with him some of Daniel's people to take the boy back, as well as the story of Daniel's family: Four generations ago, during the Napoleonic era, a French aristocrat named Armand colonised the island. Although Armand had a wife, he had affairs with several natives, one of which bore him a son, named Beauxhomme. When Beauxhomme grew up, war broke out between the peasant locals and the French. The peasants won the war with Beauxhomme's help, after which he banished Armand back to France. Before leaving, however, Armand cursed Beauxhomme and his descendants saying their \"black blood will keep them forever on the island, while their hearts yearn forever for France.\" To this day the curse causes future Beauxhommes to alienate the peasants for reminding them of their homeland (\"The Sad Tale of the Beauxhommes\"). Ti Moune is tearfully separated from Daniel and tells her parents that she will go after Daniel to marry him, and though they are reluctant to let her go, they eventually give her their blessing (\"Ti Moune\"). The goddess Asaka tells Ti Moune not to fear, as the Earth will give her everything she needs on her journey to Daniel (\"Mama Will Provide\").\n\nTi Moune travels across the island (\"Waiting for Life (Reprise)\"), and the storytellers relate the many versions of her difficult journey to the city (including being forced to wear too-tight shoes), through the hotel gates and finding Daniel's room (\"Some Say\"). Daniel, still ill and unable to walk, does not remember her but believes her after she describes the scar on his chest. As they stay together, Erzulie gives them the gift of love (\"Human Heart\"). Daniel ignores the townspeople's gossiping (\"Pray (Reprise)\") over the unlikely relationship between a rich Beauxhomme and a poor peasant. Daniel delights in Ti Moune's differences from the rich girls in his life, noting that \"some girls you marry, some you love\" (\"Some Girls\").\n\nAt a ball held at the hotel (\"The Ball\"), Andrea Devereaux, a daughter of Daniel's family friends, cajoles Ti Moune to dance for them (her ulterior motive being to make her look bad in front of the grands hommes ). Ti Moune does dance and gains the admiration of the rich society members, inspiring both the peasant servants and the grand homme guests to join her (\"Ti Moune's Dance\"). Afterwards, Ti Moune learns that Daniel is already engaged to be married to Andrea (\"When We Are Wed\"). Daniel, reminded of his responsibilities, must go through with the arranged marriage, although he insists they can be lovers forever, leaving Ti Moune crushed. Papa Ge reappears and reminds Ti Moune of her promise to exchange her life for Daniel's \u2013 but says she can revoke the bargain if she kills Daniel (\"Promises/Forever Yours (Reprise)\"). Ti Moune enters Daniel's room with a knife, but she still loves him too much to kill him, proving love is stronger than death. However, Daniel finds Ti Moune with the knife. Appalled at the attempted murder, the Beauxhommes throw her out of the hotel grounds.\n\nBarred from the hotel, Ti Moune waits for two weeks to try and meet Daniel at the gate. As Daniel and Andrea are married, they follow an old tradition of throwing coins to the peasants outside the hotel gates. Ti Moune calls to Daniel who gently places a silver coin in Ti Moune's hand, kisses her cheek, and leaves. The storytellers tell of how the gods were moved to tears by Ti Moune's selflessness and love, and chose to bestow a final kindness on her; Erzulie took her by the hand and led her to the ocean, where Agw\u00e9 allowed her to drown peacefully. Papa Ge received her gently and brought her back to shore where Asaka transformed her into a tree (\"A Part of Us\").\n\nThe tree becomes a celebration of life and love that cracks open the gates of the hotel, allowing those of all social statuses to become one, including a peasant girl and a young grand homme , Daniel's son, as they play in her branches. As the years go by, the story of Ti Moune is told again and again, passed down through generations as proof of the power of love and stories to bring people together. As the musical ends, the little girl who was frightened by the storm begins to retell the story herself (\"Why We Tell the Story\").",

        "description": "The Maid of the Mountains , called in its original score a musical play , is an operetta or \"Edwardian\" musical comedy in three acts. The music was by Harold Fraser-Simson , with additional music by James W. Tate , lyrics by Harry Graham and additional lyrics by Frank Clifford Harris and Valentine , and the book was written by Frederick Lonsdale , best known for his later society comedies such as On Approval . After an initial try-out at the Prince's Theatre in Manchester on 23 December 1916, the show was rewritten and opened at Daly's Theatre in London on 10 February 1917.\n\nProduced by Robert Evett (after being turned down by Frank Curzon ) and directed by Oscar Asche (who had directed the record-setting hit Chu Chin Chow ), The Maid of the Mountains ran for 1,352 performances in its initial London run \u2013 closing mainly because of the nervous exhaustion of its female lead, Jos\u00e9 Collins . This highly profitable run saved the George Edwardes estate, then being managed by Evett, from bankruptcy.\n\nThe original New York production (1918) did not catch on, only running for 37 performances. However, Asche also directed the first Australian production for J. C. Williamson's in Australia in 1917, followed by another production in 1923. This became as successful as the London production, with soprano Gladys Moncrieff becoming famous as Teresa. The show had major London revivals in 1921, 1930, 1942 (starring Sylvia Cecil at the London Coliseum ) and 1972 in an Emile Littler production at the Palace Theatre in the West End , and at the Finborough Theatre , London, in December 2006 with a cast including Anita Louise Combe , as well as numerous other professional productions elsewhere.\n\nThe musical was popular with amateur theatre groups, particularly in Britain, from the 1930s to about 1970.",
        "synopsis": "The Maid of the Mountains is an escapist story set in a bandit camp, high up in the mountains (presumably in Italy). The bandit maid Teresa loves the bandit chief, Baldassar\u00e9, who is feared by the whole country. Baldassar\u00e9's men are unhappy because of the decision of Baldassar\u00e9 to disband, and they ask Teresa to dissuade him. Baldassar\u00e9 gives Teresa and the others their shares of the spoils of many raids. He tells her that she must leave at once, because their hiding place is surrounded. She pleads to be allowed to stay, but goes sadly. The local Governor, General Malona, captures Teresa and brings her to the Palace of Santo. He wishes to capture the rebel band before the impending end of his term of office. He promises Teresa her freedom if Baldassar\u00e9 is captured. Teresa refuses, as \"there is honour among thieves.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Baldassar\u00e9 and some of his band have seized the new Governor, Count Orsino. Donning the uniforms of the captives, the brigands proceed to Santo to rescue Teresa. Baldassar\u00e9 meets and falls in love with Angela, the daughter of the retiring Governor, and becomes heedless of his danger in remaining in the town. He pretends to be the new governor. Beppo, one of the brigands who has always been in love with Teresa, asks her to persuade Baldassar\u00e9 to leave the capital lest they all be discovered. Teresa, mad with jealousy because of Baldassar\u00e9's love for Angela, exposes the new \"governor\" as Baldassar\u00e9, and he and his companions are arrested and sent to Devil's Island .\n\nLater, Teresa, who sadly regrets betraying Baldassar\u00e9, pleads with the General to release him. In the loneliness of his imprisonment, Baldassar\u00e9 realises that his regard for Angela was only a passing infatuation, and that he loves Teresa. He forgives her betrayal of him and, with the assistance of Lieutenant Rugini, the Governor of the prison, they escape by boat. All ends happily for Teresa and her bandit chief.",

When he inherits a large sum from a relation in Mexico he stands to see none of it because his creditors would claim it all. His resourceful wife comes up with a solution: the cousin to whom the legacy reverts on Aubrey's death is believed to be dead. Aubrey's supposed death in an explosion in his laboratory enables him to come to life again masquerading as the cousin from Mexico, able to collect the full legacy. He reappears in sombrero and extravagantly Mexican guise. Unfortunately for the conspirators, the cousin's long-estranged wife claims Aubrey as her own, and a further fake suicide \u2013 this time by drowning \u2013 ensues so that Aubrey can escape her. Meanwhile Sprules, the family butler, has got wind of the plot, and seeks to cash in by arranging for his brother to impersonate the Mexican cousin. The impostor's arrival necessitates a further reincarnation of Aubrey, this time as the new curate of a nearby parish. He tries to come to an agreement with the pretended Mexican, but they are interrupted by the arrival of the very-much-alive real cousin. In the end it turns out that there is no legacy to be had: the money has been annexed by the Mexican Revolutionary Committee.",

        "synopsis": "Oliver, a male Helperbot-3 model, powers on in his apartment in Helperbot Yards, a living facility in Seoul for retired Helperbots. He initiates his daily routine while listening to a song by jazz singer Gil Brentley (\"Why Love?\"). Oliver goes through the cycle of listening to music, caring for his potted plant HwaBoon, and receiving his regular Jazz Monthly magazine and replacement parts, while awaiting the return of his owner James from a long trip to Jeju Island . Years go by, and Helperbot Inc. discontinues manufacturing his replacement parts, but he has faith that James will return (\"World Within My Room\"). One day Claire, a female Helperbot-5 and one of his neighbors, knocks on his door to ask for help as her charger is broken. Oliver reluctantly gives her his charger, but insults her by bragging about the superior durability of the Helperbot-3s compared to the newer Helperbot-5s. Offended, Claire returns to her room to try to fix her charger herself, with little success. She reaches out to her friends, but they are unable to help due to their own maintenance issues (\"The Way That It Has to Be\"). Eventually, Oliver offers to let her use his charger if she sticks to a fixed schedule of picking it up and returning it. Claire agrees, and the exchange becomes a routine for the two of them (\"Charger Exchange Ballet\"). One day, Claire does not show up, and Oliver checks on her. Claire has managed to jerry-rig an external power supply and no longer needs the charger. Oliver denies that he was concerned about her and claims that he is glad he will not have to deal with her anymore. Claire runs a diagnostic and learns that her battery life is failing. Later, she visits Oliver's place to thank him and discovers he has been collecting money through bottle deposits so that he can travel with HwaBoon to Jeju Island to reunite with James (\"Where You Belong\"). Claire expresses interest in also going to Jeju Island, as it is the only place left in the world to see fireflies. She proposes they go together using her car. Oliver accepts, and they prepare for their trip (\"Hitting the Road, Part 1\", \"Goodbye, My Room\", \"Hitting the Road, Part 2\"). As it is illegal for retired Helperbots to go out in public on their own, they plan to pretend they are a human couple on holiday and come up with a believable story of how they first met (\"The Rainy Day We Met\"). Claire makes Oliver promise they will not fall in love, recalling the relationship between her married former owners, Jiyeon and Suhan.\n\nClaire starts to run out of battery as they drive to the ferry, so they stop to charge at a motel that turns out to be a love hotel . The pair book a room for the night without being discovered, despite awkward conversations with the motel owner and another guest (\"Jenny\"). While in the room they bond over watching the movie Terminator 2: Judgment Day and mocking its depiction of robots; Claire begins to think that being with Oliver is not so bad (\"How to Be Not Alone\"). While Oliver is powered down, Claire accesses his memories, learning that James had lied to protect Oliver's feelings, and his move to Jeju Island was to be permanent, as was Oliver's retirement. On the road the next day, Claire frets over whether to tell Oliver the truth (\"Hitting the Road, Part 3\"). When they arrive at James's house on Jeju Island, Claire attempts to warn Oliver that James will break his heart (\"What I Learned from People\"). She shows Oliver her own memories of Jiyeon leaving her. Jiyeon had given Claire her administrative password so that she could access a deleted memory of Suhan making a pass at Claire: he was insecure about his lower social status than Jiyeon's, leading to the breakdown of their marriage. As Oliver protests that James is different, they are interrupted by the arrival of James's son, Junseo. Junseo reveals that James had died some years before, having moved to Jeju to be taken care of after he got sick, and that Junseo resented Oliver for replacing him as James's son after his parents separated, and so he forced James to leave Oliver behind. Junseo bitterly gives Oliver a Gil Brentley record that James left for him. Oliver despondently tells Claire she was right, but she notes that James proved her wrong by leaving a gift for Oliver, showing he truly cared about him (\"'Goodbye Love' Piano Solo\"). Though upset, Oliver suggests they go see the fireflies as Claire had wanted. As they walk into the forest, the lightning bugs slowly appear (\"Chasing Fireflies\"). The two excitedly take in the sight and even manage to catch one, which they put into a jar (\"Never Fly Away\").\n\nThey return to Seoul but feel their dynamic has changed (\"A Sentimental Person\"). Realizing that they've fallen in love with each other (\"When You're in Love\"), they admit their feelings and share a kiss (\"Touch Sequence\" (instrumental)). They realize their relationship has a time limit, but they continually put off ending it to do the things they think a human couple would do, even attempting to have a fight (\"Then I Can Let You Go\"). Eventually, Claire's body starts to fail her more, with her battery life continuing to diminish. Claire has at most a year of functionality left, while the durable Oliver has much longer. Hoping to spare each other pain, they try to end their relationship but cannot stop thinking of each other (\"Goodbye, My Room\" (reprise)). One day, Junseo visits Oliver, requesting some good memories of his father. While loading the memories onto a drive, the two talk about the importance of sharing happy memories with loved ones even if they feel painful, which causes Oliver to realize he cannot simply forget Claire. Before leaving, Junseo gives Oliver his administrative password as a peace offering. As both of them have their passwords, Oliver and Claire are able to erase their memories of each other. They decide this would be the best path for both of them; they agree that it is not a tragic ending but a kind of happy ending as their experiences still occurred (\"Maybe Happy Ending\"). They both get rid of objects that would remind them of their past, including the firefly they caught together, and seemingly erase their memories (\"Memory Sequence\" (instrumental)).\n\nSometime later, Oliver powers on in his apartment and greets HwaBoon as usual before initiating his daily routine (\"Why Love\" (reprise)). He is interrupted when Claire knocks on his door asking to borrow his charger. He hesitantly lets her in and gives her the charger before whispering to HwaBoon, \"Don't tell her.\" While Claire charges she makes conversation, repeating some of the prior things she had initially said to Oliver. He responds with his prior bragging about the superiority of Helperbot-3s to Helperbot-5s. After a moment, however, he admits to some advantages of the newer model by listing things Claire helped him with before. Touched, Claire asks, \"Do you think it'll be okay?\" Oliver responds that he hopes so (\"Finale\").\n\n### Differences between Korean and English versions\n\nThe English-language version of Maybe Happy Ending largely follows the same plot as the Korean version, with the removal and addition of several characters and songs. In the Korean version, Oliver is a Helperbot-5 and Claire is a Helperbot-6. Characters in the Korean version that were cut are Oliver's mailman, whose aging during \"World Within My Room\" signifies the passage of time, and Claire's friend John, a fellow Helperbot-6 who visits to help fix her charger. Gil Brentley is an expanded version of the nameless spectral jazz singer in the Korean version, where he is part of the James/Multi-man role. James' son Junseo is new in the English version; in the Korean version, Oliver's interaction with James' family takes place offstage during the song \"What I Learned from People\". Claire's owners Jiyeon and Suhan, portrayed in a pre-recorded video, are absent from the Korean version, where their relationship is portrayed via a duet between the onstage band's violinist and cellist. The English version adds a subplot about Helperbots' administrative passwords; in the Korean version, Claire and Oliver are able to erase their memories without a password. In the Korean version, there is a subplot involving a clasp that Oliver makes for Claire as an adapter for his charger; in the final scene Oliver gives it to Claire after it is revealed that he kept his memories. The English version runs about 10 minutes shorter than the Korean version, cutting the scene and song \"Nevertheless\" ( \uadf8\ub7fc\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 ), which explicitly depicts Claire breaking down and Oliver's attempts to repair her. :\u200a46:38",

        "title": "Saratoga (musical)",
        "description": "Saratoga is a 1959 musical with a book by Morton DaCosta , lyrics by Johnny Mercer , and music by Harold Arlen .\n\nBased on Edna Ferber 's sprawling 1941 novel Saratoga Trunk , it focuses on Clio Dulaine, an \"illegitimate\" Creole woman who seeks revenge on the New Orleans family who exiled her mother when she became impregnated by their son. Posing as a countess raised in France , she joins forces with Montana cowboy Clint Maroon, whose family's property was appropriated by railroad tycoon Bart Van Steed. Clint persuades Clio to seduce Bart into proposing marriage, but the conspirators soon find themselves falling in love while scheming to settle old scores.\n\nThe success of the musical adaptation of Ferber's Show Boat convinced her lightning could strike twice. She first approached Rodgers and Hammerstein with her proposal, and when they opted to write Pipe Dream instead, she turned to Lerner and Loewe , who agreed to compose the score but lost interest after My Fair Lady opened. DaCosta wrote a first draft of the book, which Ferber disliked, and when her offer to adapt the book herself was declined, she backed out of the project.\n\nThe bulk of the financing was provided by NBC and RCA Victor , which released the original cast recording . Rock Hudson and Jeanmaire originally were announced as the leads, but ultimately neither participated in the show.\n\nThe Broadway production, directed by DaCosta and choreographed by Ralph Beaumont, opened on December 7, 1959 at the Winter Garden Theatre , where it ran for 80 performances. The cast included Carol Lawrence as Clio, Howard Keel as Clint, and Warde Donovan as Bart, with Virginia Capers , Odette Myrtil , Carol Brice , and Edith King in supporting roles. Nat Horne was a featured dancer in the production.\n\nCritics were impressed by the elaborate sets (which included a turntable and fifteen different locales) and the more than two hundred costumes created by Cecil Beaton , who won the Tony Award for Best Costume Design and was nominated for Best Scenic Design. The leads drew good notices, but most agreed that DaCosta's book and direction resulted in a slow-moving, uninvolving production. The main characters were unlikeable, their romance dull, and too many peripheral characters wandered in and out of the action. Show Boat , with its riverboat setting, had been a natural for musical adaptation, and whereas Oscar Hammerstein II and Jerome Kern had succeeded in compressing the epic into a lively stage production, the creative team behind Saratoga was unable to wring much excitement from a romantic relationship stemming primarily from a mutual desire for vengeance.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nAs the sun rises, Rafiki the mandrill calls the animals to Pride Rock. She greets King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi before presenting their cub to the gathered animals (\" Circle of Life \"). Elsewhere, Mufasa's brother, Scar , laments his lost chance at becoming King. Back at her baobab tree , Rafiki paints an image of the cub and asks the spirits to conjure the new prince 's name: Simba .\n\nTime passes and Simba grows into a lively young cub (\"Grasslands Chant\"). Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands from the top of Pride Rock and explains that everything exists in a delicate balance known as the Circle of Life. Mufasa warns Simba not to stray beyond the boundaries of the Pride Lands, pointing out a shadowy area in the distance. Zazu , a hornbill who acts as Mufasa's advisor, arrives and delivers his daily report on the state of affairs in the King's domain (\"The Morning Report\", now cut from the Broadway production).\n\nSimba goes to see his Uncle Scar. The scheming lion piques the cub's curiosity by mentioning the elephant graveyard, where Simba is forbidden to go. Meanwhile, the lionesses go hunting (\"The Lioness Hunt\"). Simba arrives and asks his best friend, a female cub named Nala , to come with him to the elephant graveyard. He lies to the lionesses about where they are going, and Sarafina (Nala's mother) and Sarabi allow the cubs to go, escorted by Zazu. Simba and Nala formulate a plan and manage to lose Zazu, while Simba brags about his future position (\" I Just Can't Wait to Be King \").\n\nThe cubs go to the graveyard and begin to explore. Zazu catches up, but they are confronted by three hyenas: Shenzi, Banzai and Ed . The hyenas intend to eat the trespassers and they gloat about their find (\"Chow Down\"). Mufasa rescues the cubs and frightens off the hyenas.\n\nMufasa is disappointed and angry at Simba's reckless disobedience, and explains the difference between bravery and bravado. Mufasa tells Simba about the great kings of the past and how they watch over everything from the stars (\"They Live in You\"). Mufasa says that he will always be there for his son. Later he discusses Simba's behavior with Zazu, who reminds Mufasa that he had the same tendency to get into trouble at Simba's age.\n\nBack at the elephant graveyard, Scar tells the hyenas of his plan to kill Mufasa and Simba so that he can become king. He raises an army of hyenas, promising that they will never go hungry again if they support him (\" Be Prepared \"). Scar takes Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there. On Scar's signal, the hyenas start a wildebeest stampede into the gorge (\"The Stampede\"). Scar tells Mufasa that Simba is trapped in the gorge. Mufasa leaps into the stampede and manages to save his son, but as he tries to escape, Scar throws him off the cliff back into the stampede, killing him. Scar convinces Simba that his father's death was his fault and tells him to run away, but as he leaves, Scar orders the hyenas to kill him. Simba escapes but the hyenas tell Scar that he is dead. Rafiki and the lionesses mourn the deaths (\"Rafiki Mourns\"). Scar claims the throne and allows the hyenas into the Pride Lands (\"Be Prepared (Reprise)\"). Rafiki returns to her tree and smears the drawing of Simba, while Sarabi and Nala quietly grieve.\n\nOut in the desert, Simba collapses from heat exhaustion . Vultures begin to circle, but are scared away by Timon the meerkat and Pumbaa the warthog. Simba feels responsible for Mufasa's death, but the duo take the cub to their jungle home and show him their carefree way of life and bug diet (\" Hakuna Matata \"). Simba grows to adulthood in the jungle.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe chorus, dressed in colorful clothes with ornate bird puppets and kites, begin the second act (\"One by One\").  As the song ends, however, the beautiful birds are replaced by vultures and gazelle skeletons. Under Scar's rule, the Circle of Life is out of balance and a drought has hit the Pride Lands. Zazu, now a prisoner of Scar, listens to the king's woes. The hyenas are complaining about the lack of food, but Scar is only concerned with himself and why he is not loved. He is haunted by visions of Mufasa and rapidly switches between delusional confidence and paranoid despair (\" The Madness of King Scar \"). Nala arrives to confront Scar about the famine and Scar decides she will be his queen and give him cubs. Nala fiercely rebukes him and resolves to leave the Pride Lands to find help. Rafiki and the lionesses bless her for her journey (\" Shadowland \").\n\nBack in the jungle, Timon and Pumbaa want to sleep, but the restless Simba is unable to settle. Annoyed, Simba leaves them, but Timon and Pumbaa lose their courage and follow him. Simba leaps across a fast-moving river and challenges Timon to do the same. Timon falls in and is swept downstream. He grabs a branch over a waterfall and calls for Simba's help, but Simba is paralyzed by a flashback of Mufasa's death. Timon falls from the branch and Simba snaps out of the flashback, rescuing his friend. Simba is ashamed that Timon nearly died because of his recklessness.\n\nThe three friends settle to sleep and discuss the stars. Simba recalls Mufasa's words, but his friends laugh at the notion of dead kings watching them. Simba leaves, expressing his loneliness and bitterly recalling Mufasa's promise to be there for him (\" Endless Night \"). Rafiki hears the song on the wind, joyfully realizes that Simba is alive, and draws a mane onto her painting of Simba.\n\nIn the jungle, Pumbaa is hunted and chased by a lioness. Simba confronts her and saves his friend, but recognizes the lioness as Nala. She is amazed to find Simba alive, knowing that he is the rightful king. Timon and Pumbaa are confused, but Simba asks them to leave him and Nala alone. Timon realizes what is happening and laments the end of Simba's Hakuna Matata lifestyle (\" Can You Feel the Love Tonight \"). Nala tells Simba about the devastated Pride Lands, but Simba still feels responsible for Mufasa's death and refuses to return home.\n\nOn his own, Simba meets Rafiki, who explains that his father lives on (\" He Lives in You \"). Mufasa's spirit appears in the sky and tells Simba he is the one true king and must take his place in the Circle of Life. Reawakened, Simba finds his courage and heads for home. Meanwhile, Nala wakes Timon and Pumbaa to ask where Simba is, and Rafiki appears to tell them all the news. The three of them catch up with him in the Pride Lands, where he witnesses the ruin of his home. Timon and Pumbaa distract some hyenas by doing the Charleston , allowing Simba and Nala to reach Pride Rock.\n\nScar calls for Sarabi and demands to know why the lionesses are not hunting. Sarabi stands up to him about the lack of anything to hunt, angrily comparing him to Mufasa, and Scar strikes his sister-in-law, saying he's ten times the king Mufasa was. Enraged, Simba reveals himself. Scar forces a confession of murder from Simba and corners him. Believing that he has won, Scar taunts Simba by admitting that he killed Mufasa. Furious, Simba recovers and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the lionesses (\"Simba Confronts Scar\"). Simba's friends fight the hyenas while Simba battles Scar to the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for his life, blaming the hyenas for everything. Simba lets him leave out of mercy, but Scar attacks again. Simba blocks the attack and Scar falls from the cliff. The hyenas, who heard Scar's betrayal and are still starving, tear him to shreds.\n\nWith the battle won, Simba's friends come forward and acknowledge Simba as the rightful king. Simba ascends Pride Rock and roars out across the kingdom (\"King of Pride Rock\"). The Pride Lands recover and the animals gather in celebration as Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub, continuing the Circle of Life (\"Circle of Life (Reprise)\").",

        "title": "Tangled",
        "description": "Tangled is a 2010 American animated musical fantasy comedy film loosely based on the German fairy tale \" Rapunzel \", and produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios . Directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard , and written by Dan Fogelman , it stars Mandy Moore , Zachary Levi , and Donna Murphy . The film tells the story of Rapunzel , a young princess with magical long blonde hair who tries to leave her secret tower. She accepts the aid of an intruder, the outlaw Flynn Rider , to take her out into the world which she has never seen.\n\nOriginally conceived and proposed by Disney animator Glen Keane in 2001, Tangled spent six years in production at a cost that has been estimated at $260 million, which, if accurate, would make it the most expensive animated feature film ever made and one of the most expensive films of all time. The film employed a unique artistic style by blending together features of computer-generated imagery (CGI) and traditional animation while using non-photorealistic rendering to create the impression of a painting. Composer Alan Menken , who had collaborated on prior Disney animated features, returned to score Tangled , and also wrote the film's songs with lyricist Glenn Slater . Before the film's release, its title was changed from Rapunzel to Tangled , reportedly to market the film gender-neutrally.\n\nTangled premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles on November 14, 2010, and was released on November 24 by Walt Disney Pictures .

        "synopsis": "A drop of sunlight falls from the sky and produces a magic flower with healing properties. For centuries, Gothel uses the flower to retain her youth, until it is taken by soldiers from the kingdom of Corona and used to save their ill, pregnant queen. She gives birth to Rapunzel , whose blonde hair contains the flower's magic. At night Gothel sneaks into the castle and cuts a lock of her hair, but it turns brown and loses its magic. She then abducts Rapunzel and raises her in a hidden tower in the woods, keeping Rapunzel's magic for herself. Each year on Rapunzel's birthday, the king and queen release sky lanterns , hoping they will guide Rapunzel home. Unaware of her royal identity, Rapunzel grows up isolated from the kingdom, believing the tower to be her only safe home.\n\nGrowing up, Rapunzel is fascinated by the annual lights, and on her 18th birthday, asks to leave the tower and investigate them, but Gothel refuses, claiming the outside world is too dangerous. Meanwhile, Flynn Rider steals the lost princesses crown from the palace;  betrays the Stabbington brothers, his partners-in-crime, and gets pursued by royal guard-horse Maximus . Flynn discovers and takes refuge in Rapunzels tower, where she knocks him out and hides him. When Gothel berates Rapunzel for mentioning the lanterns again and refuses to let her ever leave the tower, Rapunzel hatches a new plan and asks Gothel for new paint as a gift, sending her on a three-day journey. After hiding Flynn's satchel containing the crown, Rapunzel strikes a deal with Flynn, promising to return the crown in exchange for taking her to see the lanterns.\n\nOutdoors for the first time since infancy, Rapunzel experiences conflicting feelings of excitement and guilt. Flynn takes Rapunzel to the Snuggly Duckling pub, where thugs try to capture the wanted Flynn, but Rapunzel charms them into revealing their softer sides. When royal guards arrive, the thugs help Rapunzel and Flynn escape. Flynn and Rapunzel become trapped in a fast-flooded cave; believing they will suffocate, Flynn reveals his true name, Eugene Fitzherbert. Rapunzel uses the magic glow of her hair to reveal a hidden underwater exit, and they escape. Meanwhile, Gothel returns to the empty tower and finds the satchel with the crown and a wanted poster of Eugene. Inspired by the discovery, Gothel finds the Stabbington brothers and strikes a deal with them to find Rapunzel. That night, Gothel confronts Rapunzel alone and gives her the satchel, telling her to give it to Eugene to test his loyalty.\n\nThe next morning, Maximus tracks down Eugene and attempts to arrest him, but Rapunzel convinces them to strike a truce. Rapunzel and Eugene enter the kingdom and attend a festival in honor of the \"lost princess\". After a day of celebration, they sail onto the lake to watch the release of the lanterns. Rapunzel gives Eugene the crown, and they confess their mutual love. When Eugene sees the Stabbingtons on the shore, he goes to apologize and offers them the crown. The brothers tie him up, tricking Rapunzel into thinking he abandoned her. They try to capture Rapunzel, but Gothel stages a rescue by knocking them out and takes Rapunzel back to the tower.\n\nEugene is arrested, but Maximus and the pub thugs help him escape. Meanwhile, Rapunzel realizes she has subconsciously incorporated the kingdom's standard , a golden sun, into her artwork throughout her life. Realizing that she is the \"lost princess\", Rapunzel confronts and disowns Gothel. Since Gothel cannot fake her love for Rapunzel anymore, she reveals her true self. Eugene arrives at the tower, but is tricked and impaled by Gothel with her dagger. Gothel attempts to take the chained and gagged Rapunzel away, but Rapunzel promises she will never stop defying Gothel and attempting to escape, unless Gothel allows her to heal the dying Eugene. Gothel reluctantly agrees, but Eugene, realizing Rapunzel would spend the rest of her life in captivity, cuts off her long hair before she can heal him. Rapunzel's hair turns brown, and a horrified Gothel suddenly ages rapidly before falling from the tower to her death, turning to dust in the process, while Eugene dies in Rapunzel's arms. Rapunzel mourns Eugene, but one of her tears, which still has some of the flower's magic, revives him.\n\nRapunzel and Eugene return to Corona, where Rapunzel is reunited with her birth parents, Eugene is pardoned for his crimes, and the kingdom celebrates. Rapunzel and Eugene eventually marry.",

        "description": "Disney's My Son Pinocchio: Geppetto's Musical Tale is a musical based on Disney 's 2000 made-for-television movie Geppetto . Gepetto was written by David Stern, and Stern also wrote the book for the musical, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz . As in the TV film, when Pinocchio runs away to become a star in Stromboli's puppet show, Geppetto must negotiate through a maze of adventures and comic encounters to find him.\n\nThe musical premiered under its former name, Disney's Geppetto & Son , at The Coterie Theatre, Kansas City, Missouri in 2006.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nThe Blue Fairy greets the audience and explains that they will celebrate the story of one of her perfectly granted wishes \u2014 bringing Pinocchio to life at the request of his creator, Geppetto (\"When You Wish Upon a Star\"). However, Geppetto arrives and asks the Fairy to take Pinocchio back, explaining that he is defective. The Fairy, outraged at this request, takes Geppetto back in time to learn the truth. They arrive at Geppetto's toy shop the morning before the wish was made where Geppetto encounters a stream of children eager to buy his new toys (\"Toys\"). He is saddened because he is not a father since all the other parents have children. Once the children have gone home for the night, he puts the finishing touches on Pinocchio and wishes for his heart to be filled (\"Empty Heart\"). After he goes to sleep, the Blue Fairy appears and brings Pinocchio to life, telling him to prove himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, and someday, he will become a real boy.\n\nGeppetto insists that Pinocchio was not a success at all, and the Fairy jumps ahead in time to learn more of the story (\"Rise and Shine\").  Geppetto teaches Pinocchio a song (\"Geppetto and Son\"), and a series of flashbacks are shown. After the flashbacks, they meet an unsuccessful puppeteer named Stromboli who immediately becomes interested in Pinocchio, thinking he would be worth a fortune to him in his puppet show, but the Blue Fairy frightens Stromboli away. Pinocchio becomes upset upon overhearing Geppetto telling the Fairy that he does not want him and runs away. The Fairy informs Geppetto that the problem is not Pinocchio; it is Geppetto himself. He angrily dismisses her, but she assures that these things have a way of working themselves out (\"When You Wish Upon a Star (Reprise)\").\n\nGeppetto returns home later that night to apologize to Pinocchio, only to find a note from him, stating he is going to sing and dance in Stromboli's puppet show. Geppetto convinces himself that Pinocchio will be happier living with Stromboli. Pinocchio performs with Stromboli's marionettes (\"I've Got No Strings\"). The performance is a success, but Stromboli is abusive toward Pinocchio. Geppetto arrives after the show, hoping to say goodbye, but Stromboli says Pinocchio left. Pinocchio escapes and Stromboli rages among his marionettes and vows to recapture Pinocchio (\"Bravo Stromboli\"). Meanwhile, as Geppetto searches for Pinocchio, he meets up again with the Blue Fairy, who observes that Geppetto does seem to care for Pinocchio after all. Geppetto denies this, and the Fairy finally agrees to take Pinocchio back if Geppetto can find him. Geppetto demands that the Fairy use her magic to find Pinocchio, but she demurs, explaining that magic is not the answer to everything (\"Just Because It's Magic\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nAfter intermission, the Blue Fairy expresses aloud her regret at having granted a wish to a moron. Geppetto overhears this and the two argue until they are interrupted by a pair of well-behaved children, whom Geppetto is immediately impressed with. The children introduce Geppetto and the Fairy to a couple who are waiting to see Professor Buonragazzo and his son, who make perfect children that will always be obedient to their parents. The professor makes the couple a daughter, and offers a number of other children as replacements for Pinocchio (\"Satisfaction Guaranteed\"), but a horrified Geppetto rejects them and runs away to find Pinocchio.\n\nGeppetto and the Blue Fairy meet a series of talking animals who are something they are not, due to the misguided expectations of their parents. Geppetto reflects that parents should allow their children to grow up to be themselves. The Fairy interjects to secretly inform us that she is responsible for the talking animals. After Geppetto leaves, Stromboli arrives, wishing he had Pinocchio back. The Fairy notes that at least Stromboli wants Pinocchio, unlike Geppetto. She tells Stromboli to leave and she will bring Pinocchio to him. (\"Bravo Stromboli - Reprise\").\n\nA ringmaster and his roustabouts welcomes Pinocchio and other runaway boys to Pleasure Island (\"Pleasure Island\") and they all have fun, creating chaos everywhere they go. Geppetto arrives to take Pinocchio home, but Pinocchio accuses Geppetto of not wanting him. He states that Pleasure Island is his new home. At that moment, Pinocchio and the other delinquents turn into donkeys. The Ringmaster orders them hauled away and Geppetto pursues a ship containing the transformed Pinocchio and the other donkeys leaving Pleasure Island (\"Pleasure Island (Reprise)\").\n\nA huge whale swallows Geppetto and his rowboat whole. Inside the whale, Pinocchio explains that when he jumped in the water to save Geppetto after he got swallowed by the whale, the donkey curse washed away and he became a puppet again. Geppetto promises Pinocchio that their relationship will be different from now on (\"Geppetto and Son (Whale Reprise)\"). They get out of the whale when Pinocchio has Geppetto make him tell as many lies as he can, causing his nose to grow so it can tickle the whale's uvula to get it to throw them up. They return to the toy shop, only to find Stromboli and the Blue Fairy waiting for them. Geppetto offers Stromboli his whole workshop in exchange for letting him keep Pinocchio (\"Since I Gave My Heart Away\"). Stromboli refuses to cooperate, but the Fairy intercedes, transforming Pinocchio into a real boy, and therefore rendering him worthless to Stromboli. The Blue Fairy, satisfied that Geppetto and Pinocchio are now a real father and a real son, notes that her perfect wish record is still intact.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nSam Wheat and his long-time girlfriend, Molly Jensen, move into a loft apartment in Brooklyn together (\"Here Right Now\"). Sam is a banker and Molly a sculptor. Their friend Carl Bruner, one of Sam's co-workers, comes to help them settle in. The three of them are a tight-knit group. Although Sam and Molly are very much in love, Sam shies away from the word \"love\", which makes Molly visibly uncomfortable. She starts to address it, but soon stops herself. Sam distracts her with a rendition of \" Unchained Melody \", leaving her insecurities temporarily forgotten.\n\nAt work, Sam notices discrepancies with several accounts and is unwilling to let them go, even though he has a date with Molly that evening (\"More\"). He confides in Carl this discovery, who agrees to keep the findings a secret and also promises to investigate himself, so Sam can keep his date. Sam meets up with Molly, who confesses that she wants to marry him. Sam is taken aback and Molly asks why he never says that he loves her (\"Three Little Words\"); he assures Molly that while he may not say it in his words, he prefers to tell her in his actions. Molly tells him that she'd still like to hear it every now and again, but his reply reassures her nonetheless. After dinner, they're approached by an armed man that tries to steal Sam's wallet. Sam fights back instead of surrendering, and the two struggle for the gun. It goes off and Sam is fatally shot, leaving Molly to cry out for help. Sam dies. However, instead of following the light, Sam becomes a ghost and stays behind with Molly, invisible to her. He follows her to the hospital, and another ghost explains what he's become (\"Ball of Wax\"). A trapped Sam struggles to reach out to Molly (\"I Can't Breathe\").\n\nBack at the apartment, Carl helps Molly clear out some of Sam's old things. She and Sam both struggle to let go of the lives they led. Later when Molly is alone upstairs, Sam's killer sneaks in and begins to rob her. Sam, worried that his killer will hurt her, manages to spook the man and he flees. Needing to know who this man is, Sam pushes himself through the front door with great effort, and follows the man all the way back to his apartment. He finds out that the man's name is Willie Lopez, and that he'll eventually return to Molly's apartment, as he couldn't find what he was looking for. Desperate, Sam then seeks out a psychic, Oda Mae Brown, who seems to be a total fraud (\"Are You a Believer?\"). By some miracle, she actually hears Sam. He convinces her to go talk to Molly on his behalf - by singing '10,000 Bottles of Beer on the Wall' obnoxiously. In the meantime, Molly is grieving (\"With You\"). She gets a visit from Oda Mae, but Molly is hesitant to believe her. Sam then had Oda Mae starts parroting things that only Sam would know. Molly comes around, and agrees to listen. Through Oda Mae, Sam tells Molly that he was set up and murdered, urging her that she needs to go to the police. Oda Mae bails as soon as she hears the stakes of the situation. Molly goes to Carl, who tells her that it's crazy, but promises to check it out. She goes to the police, while Carl goes straight to Willie's place. There, Sam discovers the truth: Carl has been embezzling money through the accounts Sam noticed the discrepancies in, and that Carl hired Willie to rob him, which led to his murder. As Molly swears to suspend all disbelief, a drunken Carl wanders the streets trying to convince himself Sam's murder was not his fault (\"Suspend My Disbelief/I Had a Life\").\n\n### Act II\n\nAt the police station, Molly discovers Oda Mae has an extensive criminal record. Shaken and believing the psychic is a fraud, she loses hope and leaves, much to Sam's dismay (\"Rain/Hold On\"). At their apartment, Molly, in her anger, sits down to do some pottery and turns on the radio. Static is heard and Molly changes the station, but as she turns the dial, \"Unchained Melody\" suddenly plays. In shock, Molly quickly turns off the radio, but after a moment, she turns it back on and slowly returns to her pottery. Sam, watching, approaches her from behind singing along. As she continues her pottery, Molly begins to get frustrated and starts to lean back as if she can feel Sam. But they are interrupted by, a knock on the door. It's Carl. Molly tells Carl that he was right, that the whole thing was crazy, and that she was just grasping at straws in her grief. He assures her that it's only natural, but she has to move on. He makes a poorly received move on her (\"Life Turns on a Dime\"). Enraged by this betrayal, Sam manages to break something, and a flustered Molly asks Carl to leave.\n\nWith the help of another ghost on the subway, Sam learns how to move objects (\"Focus\"). He then returns to Oda Mae's place to enlist her help once more (\"Talkin' Bout a Miracle\"). Instead of resorting to fraud, Oda Mae finds true psychic ability and calls on other spirits. However, while Sam is there, Willie finds her. Oda Mae escapes, running for her life. Sam uses his newfound abilities to spook Willie and chase him away. Willie runs into traffic, where he is hit by a car and dies. But, unlike Sam, he is not offered a white light: He's dragged somewhere completely different. Sam begs Oda Mae to help him protect Molly and to stop Carl from getting to the money\n\nMolly, trying to get her life together and move on, starts selling her pieces at her gallery (\"Nothing Stops Another Day\"). She apologizes to Carl for pushing him away. Carl, anxiously awaiting a call, waves her off under the guise of having a busy day. At the bank, Oda Mae poses as \"Rita Miller,\" the fictional owner of the account that Carl was extorting. Sam feeds her the correct information and they close the account. Sam goes to find Carl in his office and starts moving objects around the room to scare him. Carl understands this is Sam's spirit and he knows what really happened. Scared, Carl threatens that he'll kill Molly if he doesn't leave him alone and give him the money.\n\nAfter being handed a check for the amount in the closed account, around four million dollars, Oda Mae tries to take the money and leave the situation for good (\"I'm Outta Here\"). Sam convinces her to donate the money. The two then go see Molly to warn her about Carl. Still disillusioned, Molly tries to send her away. Sam walks through the door and communicates through Oda Mae the significance of the earrings Molly is wearing. After reading a letter for Sam that Molly has inside the apartment, Molly is able to believe again. She lets the psychic in and Oda Mae explains everything, leaving Molly emotionally distraught. Oda Mae lets Sam use her body to hold Molly and comfort her (\"Unchained Melody (Dance)\")\n\nCarl arrives, armed, desperate, and frightened for life, as he owes dangerous drug dealers money. Though he doesn't want to resort to such measures, Carl grabs Molly and holds his gun to her. He tells Sam that if he doesn't tell him where the money is, he's going to kill her. There's a struggle, and Carl is killed. He's dragged away in the same way Willie was earlier.\n\nNow that Carl is gone and Molly is safe, the light returns for Sam. Molly is able to see and hear him. Knowing it's time for him to go, Sam says goodbye to Oda Mae, and regretfully turns to Molly. Sam finally tells Molly that he loves her in the way that she wants to hear and goes into the light (\"Finale\").",

It is based on \"Tevye the Dairyman\" and other short stories by Sholem Aleichem . The story centers on Tevye , a milkman in the village of Anatevka , who attempts to maintain his Jewish traditions as outside influences encroach upon his family's lives. He must cope with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters who wish to marry for love; their choices of husbands are successively less palatable for Tevye.

It has also been a popular choice for school and community productions.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nTevye is a poor Jewish milkman in Czarist Russia . He and his bossy, sharp-tongued wife Golde have five daughters (eldest to youngest): Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava, Shprintze and Bielke. Tevye explains the customs of the Jews in the Russian shtetl of Anatevka in 1905, where their lives are as precarious as the perch of a fiddler on a roof (\" Tradition \"). At Tevye's home, everyone is busy preparing for the Sabbath meal, with Golde directing their daughters. Yente, the village matchmaker , arrives to tell Golde that widowed Lazar Wolf \u2013 the wealthy local butcher, who is older than Tevye \u2013 wants to wed Tzeitel. Hodel and Chava are excited about Yente's visit, but Tzeitel illustrates how it could have bad results (\" Matchmaker, Matchmaker \"). A girl from a poor family must take whatever husband Yente brings; yet Tzeitel wants to marry her childhood friend, Motel the tailor.\n\nTevye is delivering milk, pulling the cart himself, as his horse is lame. He asks God: Whom would it hurt \" If I Were a Rich Man \"?  The bookseller tells Tevye news from the outside world of pogroms and expulsions. Perchik, a student from the University in Kyiv, hears their conversation and scolds them for doing nothing more than talk. The men dismiss Perchik as a radical, but Tevye invites him home for the Sabbath meal and offers him food and a room in exchange for tutoring his two youngest daughters. Golde tells Tevye to meet Lazar after the Sabbath but does not tell him why, knowing that Tevye does not like Lazar. Worried that Yente will find her a husband soon, Tzeitel tells Motel to ask Tevye for her hand before the Sabbath dinner. Motel resists, as he fears Tevye's temper, and tradition says that a matchmaker must arrange marriages. Motel is also very poor and is saving up to buy a sewing machine before he approaches Tevye, to show that he can support a wife. The family gathers for the \"Sabbath Prayer\".\n\nAfter the Sabbath, Tevye meets Lazar for a drink at the village inn, assuming mistakenly that Lazar wants to buy his cow. Once the misunderstanding is cleared up, Tevye agrees to let Lazar marry Tzeitel \u2013 with a rich butcher, his daughter will never want for anything. All join in the celebration of Lazar's good fortune; even the Russian youths at the inn join in the celebration and show off their dancing skills (\" To Life \"). Outside the inn, Tevye happens upon the Russian Constable, who has jurisdiction over the Jews in the town. The Constable warns him that there is going to be a \"little unofficial demonstration\" in the coming weeks (a euphemism for a minor pogrom ). The Constable has sympathy for the Jewish community but is powerless to prevent the violence.\n\nThe next morning, after Perchik's lessons with the younger sisters, Tevye's second daughter Hodel mocks Perchik's Marxist interpretation of a Bible story. He, in turn, criticizes her for hanging on to the old traditions of Judaism, noting that the world is changing. To illustrate this, he dances with her, defying the prohibition against opposite sexes dancing together. The two begin to fall in love. Later, a hungover Tevye announces that he has agreed that Tzeitel will marry Lazar Wolf. Golde is overjoyed, but Tzeitel is devastated and begs Tevye not to force her. Motel arrives and tells Tevye that he is the perfect match for Tzeitel and that he and Tzeitel gave each other a pledge to marry. He promises that Tzeitel will not starve as his wife. Tevye is stunned and outraged at this breach of tradition, but impressed at the timid tailor's display of backbone. After some soul-searching (\"Tevye's Monologue\"), Tevye agrees to let them marry, but he worries about how to break the news to Golde. An overjoyed Motel celebrates with Tzeitel (\"Miracle of Miracles\").\n\nIn bed with Golde, Tevye pretends to be waking from a nightmare. Golde offers to interpret his dream, and Tevye \"describes\" it (\"Tevye's Dream\"). Golde's grandmother Tzeitel returns from the grave to bless the marriage of her namesake, but to Motel, not to Lazar Wolf. Lazar's formidable late wife, Fruma-Sarah rises from her grave to warn, in graphic terms, of severe retribution if Tzeitel marries Lazar. The superstitious Golde is terrified, and she quickly counsels that Tzeitel must marry Motel. While returning from town, Tevye's third daughter, the bookish Chava, is teased and intimidated by some gentile youths. One, Fyedka, protects her, dismissing the others. He offers Chava the loan of a book, and a secret relationship begins.\n\nThe wedding day of Tzeitel and Motel arrives, and all the Jews join the ceremony (\" Sunrise, Sunset \") and the celebration (\"The Wedding Dance\"). Lazar gives a fine gift, but an argument arises with Tevye over the broken agreement. Perchik ends the tiff by breaking another tradition: he crosses the barrier between the men and women to dance with Tevye's daughter Hodel. The celebration ends abruptly when a group of Russians rides into the village to perform the \"demonstration\".  They disrupt the party, damaging the wedding gifts and wounding Perchik, who attempts to fight back, and wreak more destruction in the village. Tevye instructs his family to clean up the mess.\n\n### Act II\n\nMonths later, Perchik tells Hodel he must return to Kyiv to work for the revolution . He proposes marriage, admitting that he loves her, and says that he will send for her. She agrees (\"Now I Have Everything\"). They tell Tevye that they are engaged, and he is appalled that they are flouting tradition by making their own match, especially as Perchik is leaving. When he forbids the marriage, Perchik and Hodel inform him that they do not seek his permission, only his blessing. After more soul searching, Tevye relents \u2013 the world is changing, and he must change with it (\"Tevye's Rebuttal\"). He informs the young couple that he gives them his blessing and his permission.\n\nTevye explains these events to an astonished Golde. \"Love\", he says, \"it's the new style.\" Tevye asks Golde, despite their own arranged marriage, \" Do You Love Me? \" After dismissing Tevye's question as foolish, she eventually admits that, after 25 years of living and struggling together and raising five daughters, she does. Meanwhile, Yente tells Tzeitel that she saw Chava with Fyedka.  News spreads quickly in Anatevka that Perchik has been arrested and exiled to Siberia (\"The Rumor/I Just Heard\"), and Hodel is determined to join him there. At the railway station, she explains to her father that her home is with her beloved, wherever he may be, although she will always love her family (\"Far From the Home I Love\").\n\nTime passes. Motel has purchased a used sewing machine, and he and Tzeitel have had a baby. Chava finally gathers the courage to ask Tevye to allow her marriage to Fyedka. Again Tevye reaches deep into his soul, but marriage outside the Jewish faith is a line he will not cross. He forbids Chava to speak to Fyedka again. When Golde brings news that Chava has eloped with Fyedka, Tevye wonders where he went wrong (\"Chavaleh Sequence\"). Chava returns and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to speak to her and tells the rest of the family to consider her dead. Meanwhile, rumors are spreading of the Russians expelling Jews from their villages. While the villagers are gathered, the Constable arrives to tell everyone that they have three days to pack up and leave the town. In shock, they reminisce about \"Anatevka\" and how hard it will be to leave what has been their home for so long.\n\nAs the Jews leave Anatevka, Chava and Fyedka stop to tell her family that they are also leaving for Krak\u00f3w , unwilling to remain among the people who could do such things to others. Tevye still will not talk to her, but when Tzeitel says goodbye to Chava, Tevye prompts her to add \"God be with you.\"  Motel and Tzeitel go to Poland as well but will join the rest of the family when they have saved up enough money. As Tevye, Golde and their two youngest daughters leave the village for America, the fiddler begins to play. Tevye beckons with a nod, and the fiddler follows them out of the village.",

It was one of three films featuring Mac that were released after his death (and was actually released on the same date as another posthumous film, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa ). Mac and Isaac Hayes died on August 9 and 10, 2008, respectively, and the film is dedicated to their memory. Director Lee said the film was heavily re-edited to soften the tone of the film, as a tribute to the two actors. Critical reviews were mixed, and the film was financially unsuccessful as it grossed $12.3 million against a $40 million budget.",
        "synopsis": "The Real Deal was a soul music trio (lead singer Marcus Hooks and backup singers Floyd Henderson and Louis Hinds) that was popular decades ago. However, the group dissolved when Marcus left to become a solo act. Louis and Floyd's friendship soured, and they did not speak to each other for the next 30 years. Floyd, recently retired, is having difficulty adjusting to his new life. He learns that Marcus has died. Louis, an ex-convict who became an auto mechanic, is contacted by executive Danny Epstein to perform with Floyd at the Apollo Theater in New York City as a tribute to Marcus. Louis declines. Floyd meets with Louis and mentions that they will be paid $40,000. Louis begrudgingly agrees to travel with Floyd cross-country for the concert.\n\nThey arrive at a hotel in Flagstaff, Arizona , where they will stay overnight and perform, but their performance is a disaster. As they argue after the failed performance, they recall what caused their friendship to resolve decades earlier: Floyd's bedding Louis's girlfriend. The next morning, however, they hear one of their old songs playing on the radio, and they start dancing, reminiscing on their time as a group.\n\nThe duo perform well at a hotel in Amarillo, Texas . When their money is stolen by women posing as groupies , they contact Phillip, Epstein's intern, but he is unable to provide funds. The duo travel to Tulsa, Oklahoma to the home of a woman they used to know, Odetta. They meet Odetta's daughter Cleo and Cleo's live-in boyfriend Lester, a rapper and drug dealer. Cleo informs the travelers that Odetta died.\n\nDuring their visit, Louis notices Cleo singing and playing on her piano; he realizes she has musical talent. Floyd and Louis ask Cleo if she will join them on their trip. They see signs of physical abuse, so Louis confronts Lester, who pulls out a gun but is overtaken by Louis. Louis forces Lester to apologize to both Floyd and Cleo, then breaks Lester's arm. Arriving in Memphis, Tennessee , Floyd, Louis and Cleo meet Phillip at their hotel. Floyd and Louis perform at the hotel, with Cleo as their lead singer. Her performance attracts the attention of famed soul musician Isaac Hayes (playing himself). Meanwhile, Lester has pursued the group to Memphis, and he abducts Phillip. Floyd, who's about to tell Cleo that he believes he is her father, learns that he is not. Cleo explains that Louis is actually her father, and this leads to a physical altercation between Floyd and Louis. After the fight, Louis states that it is a bad idea to be in Cleo's life because he ruined his own. After hearing this statement, Cleo tearfully runs away. Lester confronts Louis and Floyd to retaliate against both of them, but they subdue him. However, Floyd and Louis are arrested.\n\nFloyd is released, but Louis stays in custody due to a parole violation. Floyd breaks Louis out of jail, believing that he is dying. They steal Lester's friends' car and discover Phillip has been locked in the car's trunk. Phillip contacts Danny that The Real Deal are on their way to perform, but Phillip is fired, and Floyd and Louis are removed from the show. They arrive at the theater anyway, and Floyd convinces Danny to let them perform, confiding that Louis is dying. Isaac Hayes greets them at their dressing room, and they are surprised when Cleo appears. As Louis and Cleo reconcile, he experiences abdominal pain, which causes concern that the pain is indicating his health is failing, but Louis reveals it is merely a kidney stone .\n\nThe police arrive at the theater, so Louis and Floyd hide in what looks like a piano. However, it is a piano shaped casket which contains Marcus's corpse. Floyd and Louis get out of the casket and step onstage to perform their hit \"Walk In the Park\", once again with Cleo. They are then arrested by the police.\n\nAn epilogue reads that Floyd and Louis were later released on good behavior, and they resumed touring, with Cleo as their new lead singer and Phillip as their new manager.",

Hill wrote the original lyrics to the music of Giuseppe Verdi , Charles Gounod , Jacques Offenbach , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart , Carl Maria von Weber , Gaetano Donizetti and Arrigo Boito . It premiered in Lancaster , Lancashire, England, in 1976, and had a West End production in 1991, and further international productions",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe story begins (\"Introduction\") with Richard, new manager of the Paris Opera House (previously president of Northern Railways and a member of the Stock Exchange Choir), greeted by the artists and staff (\"Welcome Sir, I'm So Delighted\"). The previous managers of the Paris Opera did not last very long, due to problems with the legend of the Opera Ghost, who demands 20,000 francs a month and his own private box. These requests are defied by the adamant and foolish Richard, little knowing the mayhem that will take place if he refuses to accept the Ghost's demands. Madame Giry, the box keeper, warns Richard that he may have upset the \"Ghost\". She is horrified when Richard demands use of Box Five (the Ghost's box). She knows the \"Ghost\" won't stand idly by while Richard refuses to accept his demands. She warns Richard to expect a run of horrific events.\n\nThe evening performance begins (\"Accursed All Base Pursuit of Earthly Pleasure\"). The ghost provides his first warning in the form of the murder of Mephistopheles. After the performance, Richard's handsome (if somewhat dim) son Raoul, who is madly in love with the chorus girl Christine Daae, goes to her dressing room, only to hear her speak with another man. Jealous, Raoul enters the room to find it empty. This \"ghost\" seems very real, as is his love for Christine and woe betide anyone who gets in his way (\"How Dare She\").\n\nA Groom comes to talk to Richard in his office about the disappearance of a horse named Caesar (\"Late Last Night I'm In The Cellars\"). Richard decides that the man is an idiot and promptly fires him. Raoul, feeling betrayed, meets with Christine at a local graveyard (\"All Of My Dreams Faded Suddenly\"). He is then introduced to the angelic voice of the Angel Of Music (\"While Floating High Above\"). Christine leaves and the Phantom attempts to throttle Raoul, but is disturbed by a Grave Digger, and runs off. Back at the Opera House, the unfortunate Richard has had to stand by while his son pursues the chorus girl Christine Daae and now must convince his diva Carlotta, who feels she is too ill to perform, to sing at the performance later that evening, with the help of his staff (\"She Says She's Got The Nodules\"). An agreement is made that Christine Daae will sing the role, while Carlotta mimes the act.\n\nThis wasn't what the Phantom had in mind. He'll not cease causing \"accidents\" and will do all in his power to disrupt the proceedings, including rubbing out the lead singer. At the evening performance, Carlotta mimes the act incorrectly and very clearly out-of-sync with Christine (\"What Do I See\"). Christine faints before the end of the performance and Carlotta starts to croak like a frog, causing her to stop the performance. Laughing madly, the Phantom declares to the whole stage that Carlotta is bringing down the chandelier. But then, he finds the chandelier is the wrong one and switches it to a candelabra, dropping it on Carlotta.\n\nAfter the performance, Christine and Raoul meet on the rooftop of the Opera House to discuss running away from the Opera House and the Phantom together. But the Phantom isn't very far away at all. He appears from behind the statue of Apollo and towers above them (\"To Pain My Heart Selfishly Dooms Me\"). Christine and Raoul leave the roof, leaving the Phantom alone. An old man enters, throwing bird-seed down for the pigeons on the Opera House's roof. The Phantom's hurt turns to anger, and he throws the unfortunate man off the building. He screams that Christine will be his and the first act ends.\n\n### Act II\n\nA performance of Faust begins with Christine singing the lead role of Marguerite (\"Ah! Do I Hear My Lover's Voice?\"). However, during the song there's an unscheduled blackout and when the lights come back up, Christine has disappeared. The show quickly adjourns and the rest of the cast search high and low for her all over the Opera House, taking their lanterns into the audience (\"No Sign! I See No Sign!\"). But to no avail. The scene switches to the Phantom's underground domain, where he has kidnapped Christine in his boat and ties her to a post at his mist-shrouded dock before rowing slowly back into the darkness, leaving Christine behind (\"Somewhere Above The Sun Shines Bright\").\n\nMeanwhile, the search party above ground migrates to the boiler room and the Persian reveals his true identity and fills us in on the Phantom's history (\"Born with a Monstrous Countenance\"). Raoul searches for a way down to the cellars below the Opera House (\"In the Shadows, Dim and Dreay\"). He succeeds and slips through a manhole with the rest of the group, into a boiler room. However things quickly heat up, literally, as the Phantom traps them inside. It looks like the end for the motley group, and they break into a chorus of (\"What an Awful Way to Perish\").\n\nThe final scene takes place in the Phantom's Chapel, with his organ and its unkempt riot of sheet music as a center-piece. He seems determined to wed Christine and expresses his love for her (\"Ne'er Forsake Me, Here Remain\"). As the song ends, Christine tears off his mask and the Phantom screams in anger and shame, hiding his face from Christine. His sobs fade, and he turns back, with a determined and violent look in his eyes, and produces a priest and chorus girl to bear witness to the forced marriage between him and Christine. But just in time, Raoul, the Persian and the rest of the group burst in, having escaped the Boiler Room and come through The Phantom's traps. The Phantom, suddenly finding himself in a tight spot, produces a knife and pulls Christine in front of him. In act of love to Christine, the Phantom stabs himself with his own dagger and dies in Christine's arms (\"Ne'er Forsake me, Here Remain\"). Christine remarks that the Phantom was always the angel of music (\"He Will Not Go Without A Friend\").",

Written, produced by and starring Tenacious D members Jack Black and Kyle Gass , it is directed and co-written by musician and puppeteer Liam Lynch . Despite being about an actual band, the film is a fictitious story about the band's origins, and their journey to find a magical pick belonging to Satan that allows its users to become rock legends.\n\nThe film was released on November 22, 2006, and was a box office bomb . The soundtrack, The Pick of Destiny , was also released in 2006 as the band's second studio album. Despite the mixed box office reception of the film at release, it has since been considered a cult classic .",
        "synopsis": "As a young man, Jables (JB) runs away from his strict, religious family and oppressive Midwestern town for Hollywood after being graced by the word of Dio on a quest to form the world's \"most awesome\" rock band. There, he meets acoustic guitarist Kage (KG), who is performing on the street, and begins worshiping him as a rock god . JB asks KG to teach him rock and roll, only to be refused. Later in the night, a homeless and crestfallen JB mopes on a park bench, seconds before being beaten up by muggers . KG takes pity on JB and agrees to teach him, letting him sleep on the couch in his small apartment. KG feeds JB's fantasy by pretending to be famous with a self-named band (\"The Kyle Gass Project\"), exploiting him to do work such as cleaning his apartment and buying him weed , under the promise that JB can audition for his fictitious band. After JB learns KG is actually unemployed and living off his parents, the two become equal, and KG apologizes to JB by giving him a brand-new guitar. They create their own band: Tenacious D, named after matching birthmarks found on their buttocks.\n\nSoon JB and KG learn the deepest secret of rock: all the rock legends used the same guitar pick, \"the Pick of Destiny\", which has 'supranatural' powers (a whole level above super). It was created by a dark wizard who had summoned Satan for his own purposes but was promptly attacked. A nearby blacksmith heard the commotion and distracted the demon by tossing a horseshoe at it, chipping its tooth in the process. As Satan was now \"incomplete\", the wizard was able to banish Satan back to Hell. To repay the blacksmith, who desired the heart of a fair maiden, the wizard fashioned the tooth into a pick that would give its holder unnatural prowess with stringed instruments. Infatuated by the prospect of becoming the next great rock star, JB immediately sets Tenacious D on a quest to steal the Pick of Destiny from the Rock & Roll History Museum. Along the way, the band briefly splits up; KG decides that sex comes first in \"sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll\" after getting invited to a party by young women, while JB wants to stick to the mission at hand. They are eventually reunited after KG is kicked out of the party.\n\nLater, after an intense chase from the museum security guards, the two manage to steal the Pick of Destiny from the rock & roll museum. Armed with this supernatural pick, they plan to use the winnings from a local bar's talent contest to pay their rent, but, before they can go on stage, they argue over who gets to use the pick first, snapping it in half accidentally. The bar's owner persuades them to go on stage and compete in the contest without the pick. The owner is revealed to be Satan in human form, who places the Pick of Destiny back on his broken tooth. Complete again, he obtains supernatural powers on earth and threatens to make Tenacious D his first victims.\n\nTo save their lives, Tenacious D challenge Satan to a rock-off, which under the terms of the \"demon code\" he cannot decline. The terms, suggested by JB, are that if Tenacious D win, Satan must return to hell and pay their rent, but if they lose, Satan can take KG back with him as a sex slave. After the duel, Satan deems his rock better and attempts to shoot KG with a bolt of lightning from his fingertips, but JB jumps in the way to save him, and the bolt bounces off the \"JB KG\" drawn logo on the base of his guitar, blowing off a piece of Satan's horn. As Satan is now incomplete once again, JB sends him back to Hell with the wizard's magical incantation.\n\nJB and KG turn Satan's horn into the \" Bong of Destiny\", which the two smoke from as they write new songs together.",

        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nAli, a 17 year-old girl, welcomes the audience to Manhattan Plaza in the neighborhood of Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan , and introduces the people in her life: the musicians who make up the artist housing in Manhattan Plaza; her friends, Tiny and Jessica; and her mother Jersey. Jersey, a singer and working woman who supports Rudy Giuliani 's rhetoric and policies on increased policing , notices Ali talking to Knuck, a bucket drummer who is part of a group that hangs out in the building, and forces them to break off their interaction (\"The Gospel\"). Ali expresses frustration over her mother's protective efforts and yearns for independence (\"The River\"). Jersey defends her protectiveness to the other residents, pointing out that Ali is only seventeen years old and is still na\u00efve and impulsive (\"Seventeen\").\n\nWhile the drummers practice in the building's courtyard, Tiny and Jessica urge Ali to make a move on Knuck (\"You Don't Know My Name\"). Ali's awkward attempt proves unsuccessful, with Knuck turning her down; shortly after, he and the other drummers are kicked out of the building due to Jersey calling the police. Ali throws a tantrum and storms out of the apartment, but is prevented from leaving the building due to a sudden rainstorm. Hiding in the building's Ellington Room (a music practice room) she notices one of the building's residents Miss Liza Jane practicing piano, and becomes enamored with what she hears; Liza Jane notices her and offers to teach her to play (\"Kaleidoscope\"). Ali tracks Knuck down at work, where he hesitantly agrees to see her again (\"Gramercy Park\"). Jersey warns Ali against dating a musician: she recalls falling for Ali's father, Davis, a piano player (\"Not Even the King\" / \"Teenage Love Affair\") but laments his continued broken promises and inability to keep plans. Ali continues to pursue Knuck, eventually sleeping with him at his apartment  (\"Un-Thinkable (I'm Ready)\"). She stumbles into the Ellington Room by accident, where Miss Liza Jane makes her sit down for a piano lesson, teaching her some basic music theory.\n\nAli rides the high of her relationship and her newfound love of music with the encouragement of Jessica, despite Tiny warning her of the danger (\"Girl on Fire\"). She invites Knuck over while Jersey is at work; Jersey returns home to find them asleep on the couch and angrily ejects Knuck from the apartment. While leaving, Knuck is shocked to learn that Ali is only seventeen. Jersey chases Ali as she follows Knuck down to the lobby, where he gets into a brief scuffle with the doorman Ray. Ali accuses Jersey of ruining her relationship because Jersey could not keep her own; Jersey slaps her in response. They are interrupted by the arrival of the police, whom Jersey called: however, seeing the scuffle they draw their weapons. Luckily, no one gets hurt, but Ali refuses to speak to her mother and retreats to the Ellington Room, where Liza Jane consoles her by pointing out the situation could have been much worse; she reflects on the racism she herself has experienced and urges Ali to continue learning to play so that she may continue a legacy of music (\"Perfect Way to Die\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nAli continues to refuse to speak with Jersey (\"Heartburn\"). When Jersey fails again to get through to Ali, she calls up Davis as a last resort (\"Love Looks Better\"). Ali tracks down Knuck at his paint job (\"Work on It\"), but is rebuffed: Knuck tells her the police continued to harass him after the arrest, forcing him to escape to Atlanta to stay with family for several weeks. Liza Jane privately reveals to Jersey she is terminally ill and likely does not have much longer to live, something she is keeping from Ali. When Ali admits sometimes she wishes Liza Jane was her mother instead, Liza Jane elects to end the lesson, urging Ali to appreciate the time she has with her mother (\"Authors of Forever\").\n\nDavis arrives at the apartment, where Jersey unloads her guilt over what she put Knuck, Ali, and the other residents through. Davis tries to offer his support, but mainly flirts with Jersey (\"Fallin\"). A tempted Jersey turns him down, and criticizes him for his absence. Ali falls asleep in the Ellington Room while looking for Liza Jane; when she wakes up she discovers Davis, who tries to bond with her by playing a song together (\"If I Ain't Got You\"). Ali is cheered up by spending time with her father, but soon realizes his unreliability when he hedges on when they can meet again. Jersey consoles Ali afterwards, and encourages her to talk to Knuck. She then tracks down Davis at his audition and warns him to stay away from Ali, refusing to let him hurt their daughter as he has hurt her (\"Pawn It All\"). Knuck reveals to Ali he is planning to move in with his family in Atlanta, due to having found community there (\"Like You'll Never See Me Again\"). The two part on amicable terms; though Ali is saddened that they have no chance of a relationship due to her youth and his moving, she finds solace in realizing she has made an adult decision for the first time. When she returns home, however, she discovers the normally music-laden building silent; she encounters Jersey who tearfully informs her of Miss Liza Jane's passing.\n\nThey attend the service held in the Ellington Room, where Ali refuses to engage with the other mourners. Davis arrives and offers a eulogy expressing gratitude for Liza Jane for helping his daughter, and plays a tune on the piano. Ali eventually joins in, leading the mourners in a song (\"Hallelujah/Like Water\"). Jersey takes a chance and invites Davis to have dinner with her and Ali the following Friday, but he fails to show up. Though disappointed, Ali commends her mother for trying her hardest, and the two resolve that they still have each other (\"No One\"). Ali tells the audience their relationship continues to be rocky, but they are on steadier ground. She admits sorrow over Knuck's departure and Miss Liza Jane's passing, but continues to pursue music and expresses fondness for her community in Hell's Kitchen (\"Empire State of Mind\").",

        "description": "Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark is a musical with music and lyrics by Bono and the Edge of Irish rock band U2 and a book by Julie Taymor , Glen Berger , and Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa . Based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man , the story incorporates elements of the 2002 film Spider-Man , the 2004 film Spider-Man 2 and the Greek myth of Arachne . It tells Spider-Man's origin story , his romance with Mary Jane Watson , and his battles with the Green Goblin . It includes highly technical stunts, such as aerial combat scenes and actors swinging from \"webs\".\n\nThe Broadway production was notorious for its many troubles. Several actors were injured performing stunts and the opening night was repeatedly delayed, causing some critics to review the \"unfinished\" production in protest. Following negative reviews, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark suspended performances for a month to retool the show. Aguirre-Sacasa, a longtime Spider-Man comics writer, was brought in to revise the story and book. The director, Julie Taymor, whose vision had driven the concept of the musical, was replaced by the creative consultant Philip William McKinley. By the time Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark officially opened on June 14, 2011, it had set the record for the longest preview period in Broadway history, with 182 performances.\n\nCritical reception of the opening was better than for the previews, but mixed, with praise for the visual effects but little enthusiasm for the book and score. Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark is the most expensive Broadway production in history, with a budget of $75 million. Julie Taymor contested reports of the budget on the BBC Radio 4 program 'This Cultural Life' claiming that the production cost was overstated and instead comparable to the Shrek musical . In the week ending January 1, 2012, it held the box office record for Broadway sales in one week, taking in $2.941 million over nine performances, until it was beaten by Wicked at the end of the year, with $2.947 million. The production closed on January 4, 2014, at a massive financial loss.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nAt Midtown High School in Queens, New York , local teenager Peter Parker gives a book report about Arachne , Goddess of the Weavers (\"The Myth of Arachne\"). As Peter gives his report, Arachne descends to the stage and tells the audience her story (\"Behold and Wonder\"). After class ends, Peter's enemy Flash Thompson and his friends gleefully torment the straight A student (\"Bullying by Numbers\"). Peter has a crush on his childhood friend Mary Jane Watson , but they both have unhappy lives (\"No More\"). Peter has lived with Uncle Ben and Aunt May ever since his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane crash when he was a child, while Mary Jane endures abuse from her alcoholic father.\n\nA few days later, Peter and his classmates go on a field trip to the genetics laboratory of scientist Norman Osborn and his wife Emily, who explain what they hope to accomplish with their genetic research (\"D.I.Y. World\"). While Peter takes pictures of the lab for the school newspaper, the Osborns lock down the lab as a dangerous genetically altered spider has escaped. While the students and scientists panic, the spider lowers itself onto Peter's shoulder and bites him (\"Venom\").\n\nPeter soon becomes aware that, as a result of the spider's bite, he has spider-like powers along with a muscular physique, 20/20 vision and the ability to emit web strings from his wrists. He uses his powers at school to defeat Flash and his friends in a fistfight (\"Bouncing Off the Walls\"). After seeing Flash give Mary Jane a ride, Peter decides to buy a car to impress her. He enters a wrestling tournament and wins the grand prize of $1,000. Peter returns home only to learn that Uncle Ben has been shot by a thief. Arachne, who has been watching over Peter, encourages him to use his gift to defend the innocent from evil (\"Rise Above\"). Peter vows to avenge Uncle Ben's death by using his powers to save the world and notes that \" with great power comes great responsibility \".\n\nPeter makes a costume and takes on the persona of \"Spider-Man\" (\"NY Debut\"). The Daily Bugle begins to publish articles about Spider-Man while Peter is hired by editor-in-chief J. Jonah Jameson as a freelance photojournalist . Meanwhile, Norman Osborn begins thinking that Spider-Man stole his research as the military organization Viper Worldwide presses him to accelerate his project (\"Pull the Trigger\"). Norman contemplates the dilemma with Emily while Peter shares his first romantic moment with Mary Jane (\"Picture This\"). Norman decides to experiment on himself, causing an electrical surge that results in Emily's accidental death. Norman goes insane and mutates into the \" Green Goblin \".\n\n### Act II\n\nThe Green Goblin comes up with a plan to genetically alter other humans as he did himself (\"A Freak Like Me Needs Company\"). Through his experiments on his former employees, he creates six villains: Carnage , Electro , Kraven the Hunter , Lizard , Swarm , and Swiss Miss. That night, Mary Jane tells Peter that her love for him has grown and he admits that the feeling is mutual (\"If the World Should End\"). The Goblin and his new alliance of criminals go on a rampage through New York (\"Sinistereo\"). Spider-Man quickly defeats the Sinister Six as the citizens of New York cheer him on (\"Spider-Man!\"), unaware that the Goblin has managed to escape. The Goblin arrives at the headquarters of the Daily Bugle and tells Jameson to print his plans of dominating the world through genetic mutation. The Goblin also tells Jameson that he gave Spider-Man life, making Jameson believe Spider-Man is in league with the Goblin. That night, Arachne comes to Peter in a vision and explains that she is his guardian, along with the reminder that being a hero is his inescapable destiny (\"Turn Off the Dark\").\n\nPeter wants to spend more time with Mary Jane after missing the opening night of her play and considers taking time off from fighting crime. Upset over Peter's constant excuses, Mary Jane suggests they take a break from their relationship (\"I Just Can't Walk Away (Say It Now)\"). Peter gives his costume to J. Jonah Jameson, telling him that Spider-Man has quit. He takes Mary Jane to a night club and impulsively proposes to her. While there, the Green Goblin intercepts the city's TV signals and sends a message to Spider-Man threatening his loved ones. Peter takes Mary Jane to his apartment and breaks off their relationship for good so that his enemies won't target her. After telling Mary Jane that he will always love her, Peter takes a walk and realizes that he needs to be a hero not only for Mary Jane but for the world (\"The Boy Falls From the Sky\"). Spider-Man recovers his costume from the Daily Bugle and goes after the Green Goblin.\n\nThe Green Goblin sits at a piano at the top of the Chrysler Building and boasts to the audience of his plan to destroy New York City (\"I'll Take Manhattan\"). Spider-Man arrives and engages the Goblin in combat, but before he can finish him, the Goblin reveals that he has Mary Jane, who now dangles from the Chrysler Building. As they battle, Spider-Man webs the Green Goblin to his piano. The Green Goblin, not realizing this, thrusts the piano over the side of the Chrysler Building, taking him down to his death. After Spider-Man saves Mary Jane, she tells him not to leave and reveals that she has guessed who he is. Peter removes his mask and they embrace. The two contemplate their new life together before sirens begin wailing and Spider-Man swings away (\"Finale: A New Dawn\").",

        "synopsis": "It is Spring, and Drake thinks about life on the farm. (\"A Poultry Tale\"). As he attempts to sneak away, Ida scolds him for neglecting their eggs that are about to hatch. Drake believes one huge egg is a turkey's egg, but Ida is doubtful. Ida expresses \"The Joy of Motherhood\" and is joined by her friend Maureen, when all of the \"normal\" eggs hatch. Drake takes the ducklings to learn to swim, leaving Ida to wait for the fifth egg to hatch (\"Different\" pre-reprise). It finally hatches to reveal Ugly. Ida is initially shocked but is overjoyed that the new arrival is not a turkey. As she teaches him to swim, she notices his amazing talent (\"Hold Your Head Up High\").\n\nWhen Drake and the ducklings return, they are aghast at Ugly's appearance and, along with Maureen, Henrietta, the Turkey, and everyone else, make fun of him, while the Cat admires what a great meal he would be (\"Look At Him\"). As Ugly tries and fails to \"quack,\" he realises he isn't the same as the others (\"Different\"). The Cat offers to be Ugly's friend and to treat him to lunch, which he happily accepts. Ugly tries to get Ida's permission, but she is too busy with the other ducklings. After Ugly leaves with the Cat, Ida realises Ugly is missing. Everyone splits up to look for him.\n\nIn his lair, the Cat is preparing to eat Ugly, who is unaware of the danger (\"Play with Your Food\"). Just as the Cat is about to strike, the children playing outside send a ball flying through the window, hitting the Cat and causing him to fall into the pot. Ugly thinks he is hiding and goes to find a hiding place of his own, but ends up getting \"Lost\". Back at the duckyard, no one can find Ugly, and they mourn him (\"The Elegy\"), but Ida refuses to believe he is dead. Jay Bird (or Maggie Pie), interrupts and begins to interview Ida for \"Britain's Most Feathered\". Ida laments about what it's like to lose one of your children (\"Every Tear a Mother Cries\"). Ida continues to search for Ugly, leaving her other four ducklings with Drake.\n\nMeanwhile, Ugly comes across two military geese, Greylag and Dot, and begs for their help. They and their \"squadron\" of geese decide to go on a reconnaissance mission to find Ugly's home (\"Wild Goose Chase\"). However, there is a shoot going on in the marsh, so the Cat sneaks in and offers to help out by telling them when the shoot is over, hoping that they will leave him alone with Ugly. Greylag sees through the Cat's plan and takes him along. The Geese and the Cat head off to the shoot, which is still going on, and get shot down. Ugly, who didn't go on the mission with them, realises that the Cat is evil and had lied. Ida sets off to find Ugly, and they both vow to find each other and be reunited. (\"Hold Your Head Up High\" Reprise).\n\nUgly wanders into a house and meets Queenie and Lowbutt, a domesticated cat and chicken. They too make fun of him not only for his looks but also for not being of \"their sort\" (\"It Takes All Sorts\"). When they turn on the TV, they see Ida and Jay Bird broadcasting a missing notice for Ugly. Ugly recognises his mother and Queenie goes to call the advertised number. Just then the doorbell rings, and the Cat enters, poorly disguised as Drake. Ugly sees through the disguise, but Lowbutt believes he is actually Ugly's father. But when Queenie comes back in, the Cat falls in love. Queenie also thinks he is a duck, but she too falls in love when he removes his disguise (\"Together\"). Lowbutt is dismayed, so she helps Ugly to escape, leaving the Cat to decide between his meal and Queenie. He chooses to go after Ugly, leaving Lowbutt to console Queenie.\n\nBack at the farmyard, Drake is forced into some responsibility, and, now that the ducklings are almost a year old, they are beginning to give Drake a hard time as teenagers. Ida, still searching for Ugly, comes across everyone that Ugly has met (\"The Collage\"). Meanwhile, Ugly finds Penny, a swan, caught in some fishing line and untangles her. Penny, knowing Ugly is a swan, invites him to migrate with her, but Ugly insists that he can't. As Penny flies away, Ugly realises he is in love with her (\"Now I've Seen You\"), but is sad because he believes she could never love someone as ugly as himself. Just then, a Bullfrog comes hopping by. Noticing his bad mood, he tells Ugly about how \"ugliness\" is just a matter of taste and that someone out there will always love you \"Warts and All\". The song cheers Ugly up, and the bullfrog leaves. Suddenly, a net drops on Ugly's head. A farmer has caught him for his family's Sunday roast . When the Farmer goes to get his knife, the Cat sneaks back onstage and offers a deal; he will lead Ugly back to the farm, but Ugly has to promise to be the Cat's lunch. Ugly agrees, and both of them head back to the farmyard.\n\nOn the way, the two get caught in a blizzard and freeze (\"The Blizzard\"). Ida unfortunately has gotten caught in it as well. Ida notices them and believes Ugly is dead. Penny and her family come to Ida and tell her to cry, that her tears of hope will save Ugly. Soon Ugly wakes up and realises he is not a duck, but a swan, then reunites with his mother (\"Transformation\"). Penny recognises that Ugly is the one who saved her earlier and the two confess their love to each other. The swans invite Ugly to come learn their ways. Although Ugly wants to stay with Ida, she insists that he go with the swans. As they fly off, Ida sings of how Ugly was different, but Ugly suddenly reappears with Penny, as they have decided to stay with Ida. Just before they leave, Ugly frees the Cat, who has remained frozen this entire time. As the Cat notices Ugly is not a duck but a swan, he goes insane before running away in defeat (\"Melting Moggy\").\n\nUgly, Penny and Ida return to the lake; everyone loves Ugly now that he is a swan. They ask for his forgiveness for making fun of him (\"Look At Him\" Reprise). Ugly happily accepts their apology and introduces Penny. Grace decides to relinquish the Red Band, now the Cygnet Ring, to Ugly, dubbing him \"the finest bird on the lake\".",

        "synopsis": "Differences from Shakespeare's plot include that the nature of the lovers' deaths is different, depending on the production. New characters such as Death (French, Belgian, Japanese, Netherlands, and Moscow productions only) and the Poet (French production only) appear for dramatic effect. Lady Capulet has a greatly increased role and in the case of the Hungarian version, has an affair with her servant. The role of Tybalt has changed slightly from being purely dark to a more pitiful character because of his growing up with the hate and a dark childhood, as well as an unrequited attraction to Juliet.\n\n### Synopsis\n\nA long-standing feud between the two leading families of the city of Verona, the Montagues and the Capulets, regularly erupts into violence on the city's streets. Irritated, the Prince of Verona decrees, on pain of death, the absolute prohibition on fighting in the city ( V\u00e9rone ). While Lady Capulet and Lady Montague denounce the violence of the two clans ( La haine ), Romeo (the sole heir of the Montagues) and Juliet (the daughter of the Capulets) are  hopelessly in search for love ( Un jour ).\n\nAt the Capulets, a ball is being held so that Juliet can meet Count Paris, who asked Lord Capulet for her hand ( La demande en mariage , Tu dois te marier ). In Verona, Romeo and his friends, Benvolio and Mercutio, hang about the streets ( Les rois du monde , La folie ). Romeo is afraid of... he doesn't really know, but he's afraid ( J'ai peur ). In the hope of distracting him, Benvolio and Mercutio, persuade him to accompany them, in disguise, to a ball being held at the house of the Capulets ( Le bal ). At his first sight of Juliet, the daughter of the Capulets, Romeo instantly falls in love with her, without knowing who she is ( L'amour heureux ). Tybalt recognize Romeo and informs Juliet's parents. Romeo and Juliet learn from the Nurse who they are ( Le bal 2 ). Tybalt, broken (he loves Juliet in secret), acknowledges that he is the son of hate and contempt ( C'est pas ma faute ).\n\nAfter the ball, Juliet takes refuge in her room and dreams of Romeo ( Le po\u00e8te ), who woos her at great personal risk in the Capulets' garden. They exchange lovers' vows and plan to marry in secret as soon as possible ( Le balcon ). Knowing that their families will never agree to their marriage, Romeo meets Friar Lawrence and asks him to marry them. He accepts hoping that this union will reconcile the two families ( Par amour ).\n\nIn the morning, Romeo meets his friends and tells the Nurse, whom everyone makes fun of ( Les beaux, les laids ), that Friar Lawrence will marry them the following afternoon. The Nurse, who deeply loves Juliet as her own daughter, announces the good news to Juliet ( Et voil\u00e0 qu'elle aime ). Finally, Romeo and Juliet are married ( Aimer ).\n\nThe next day, Benvolio and Mercutio meet Romeo: they accuse him of betrayal ( On dit dans la rue ). Out on the streets of Verona, Tybalt - unaware of his new blood tie to Romeo - searches for Romeo ( C'est le jour ) and when he finds him, challenges him to a fight, which Romeo refuses ( Le duel ). Mercutio takes up the challenge and is mortally wounded. Driven by guilt, grief, and youthful-hotheadedness, Romeo kills Tybalt ( Mort de Mercutio ). The two families, plunged into mourning, ask the Prince for revenge ( La vengeance ). Finally, he banishes Romeo from Verona and thinks about the political power ( Le pouvoir ). In her bedroom, Juliet learns the bad news from the Nurse. She is torn between the love for her cousin and for her husband. Romeo goes to Friar Lawrence's. He thinks banishment is worse than death ( Duo du d\u00e9sespoir ).\n\nRomeo and Juliet spend their wedding night together and Romeo makes his escape to Mantua ( Le chant de l'alouette ).  Shortly after her husband has left, Juliet is informed by her parents that she is to be married to Paris. She refuses and they threaten to disown her ( Demain ). Upset, Lord Capulet sings about the love he has for his daughter ( Avoir une fille ). In her room, Juliet asks why she has to obey ( Pourquoi ). In Mantua, Romeo thinks of Juliet. In desperation, she turns to Friar Lawrence, who devises an ingenious plan, which he hopes will ultimately bring a happy ending for both the lovers and their two families ( Sans elle ).\n\nJuliet appears to go along with the marriage plans but, in the night before the wedding, she takes the drug prepared by Friar Lawrence which makes her appear dead ( Le poison ). Juliet is duly laid in the family vault, hoping to wake up to find Romeo waiting for her. Unfortunately, The Friar's message telling Romeo of the plan somehow goes astray, and instead he hears only from Benvolio that his wife Juliet is dead ( Comment lui dire ).\n\nGrief-stricken, he breaks into the Capulet vault, finds what he believes to be the mortal remains of his beloved, and takes poison to be reunited with her in death ( Mort de Rom\u00e9o ). Soon afterwards, Juliet awakes to find her husband dead and she stabs herself with Romeo's dagger ( La mort de Juliette ). Friar Lawrence enters the vault and finds the two lovers dead. He complains to God ( J'sais plus ). When the whole story is told, the two devastated families agree henceforward to live in peace ( Coupables ).",

Charlie Brown discovers the letter is from a girl named Lila, who has been hospitalized for three weeks and has requested Snoopy\u2019s company. Charlie Brown and his friends are puzzled, unaware of Lila\u2019s identity or connection to Snoopy. They begin to miss Snoopy.\n\nSnoopy and Woodstock encounter multiple obstacles, including repeated \u201cNo Dogs Allowed\u201d signs on their journey to Lila. Clara, a young girl who's permitted to keep Snoopy, briefly captures and keeps them as pets. Snoopy and Woodstock escape and go camping, play football, and make music while preparing their meals.\n\nWhen they arrive at the hospital, they find that neither dogs nor birds are permitted. After an initial failed attempt, Snoopy evades security and sneaks into Lila's room. He provides her companionship and comfort, and she credits his visit with helping her recover.\n\nLinus inquires at the Daisy Hill Puppy Farm about Snoopy's origins and learns that Lila was Snoopy's original owner before Charlie Brown. Lila's family had returned Snoopy to the puppy farm while preparing to relocate. Charlie Brown faints upon hearing this.\n\nLila asks Snoopy to return home with her, but he initially decides to return to Charlie Brown. As he departs, he sees Lila watching tearfully from her hospital window. He rushes back and embraces her, which she interprets as wishing to live with her. Snoopy determines that he must first return to bid farewell to his friends.\n\nSnoopy writes a letter to Charlie Brown to inform him of his impending departure and distributes some of his possessions to his friends. The children organize a farewell party for Snoopy, each presenting him with a parting gift\u2014most of which are bones. Some of the party's attendants attempt somewhat to maintain a civil and upbeat demeanor, but even Lucy is unable to hold herself together for long. Several friends deliver speeches in Snoopy's honor. Though Charlie Brown is invited to make one as well, he is too emotional to speak or even make eye contact with Snoopy as he hands him his gift, and is only capable of emitting a pained, sorrowful wail. After Snoopy departs, Charlie Brown is too upset to eat or sleep.\n\nAt Lila's apartment complex, Snoopy sees a \"No Dogs Allowed\" sign and is pleased to have a justification for returning to Charlie Brown. Lila introduces Snoopy to her cat, whom Snoopy regards with reluctance. He points out the \u201cNo Dogs\u201d sign to Lila, who concedes that Snoopy cannot stay with her.\n\nSnoopy returns home, where the children erupt in joy and carry him back to his doghouse in celebration, where Snoopy types out formal requests for the return of the gifts he had distributed.

Darlene then takes us back to a simpler time, the 1960s, and the music of that period as well (\"Wait 'til My Bobby Gets Home\"). Enter Ellie Greenwich , a teenage girl living in Levittown, New York. She dreams of her own musical success, but is sidelined by her mother who wishes for her to pursue a degree in education. (\"A\u2026My Name Is Ellie\").

Ellie and her friends reflect on Ellie's first date with Jeff and what their future holds. (\"And Then He Kissed Me\") On their second date, Ellie believes her and Jeff are going all the way , but Jeff's intention was only to co-write music with her.

(\"Look Of Love\") Ellie, still in love with Jeff and heartbroken over the separation, refuses to let anybody know that the marriage dissolved. (\"Christmas (Baby, Please Come Home)\"). A few years have passed and Ellie is still writing music. She happens upon Jeff in the Brill Building one day when he arrives from Los Angeles on business.

        "synopsis": "For the past year, a dog named Spot has impersonated a boy named Scott and attended school with his master, fourth-grader Leonard Helperman . Spot desperately wants to become a real human boy, much to the chagrin of Leonard, who just wants a normal dog. Leonard's mother Mary Lou is invited to compete in the \"Teacher of the Year\" finals in Sunny Southern Florida , and granted use of the principal's RV to travel there under the condition that no dogs are allowed. Leonard sadly bids farewell to Spot as they leave him with a pet sitter.\n\nWatching a television talk show, Spot discovers a scientist from Southern Florida named Dr. Ivan Krank who claims he can turn animals into human beings. Determined to meet Krank and become a boy, Spot chases down the RV, disguises himself as Scott, and convinces Mrs. Helperman to allow him to travel with them.\n\nBack at home, the Helpermans' bird Pretty Boy and cat Mr. Jolly learn from a follow-up episode of the talk show that Krank cannot actually turn animals into people, but rather into awkward and grotesque hybrid creatures. Pretty Boy decides they must follow after Spot to warn him, assuring Mr. Jolly that they can be tough despite their size.\n\nArriving in Florida, Mrs. Helperman heads directly to the Teacher of the Year finals, leaving the boys alone, and Spot convinces Leonard to go with him to Krank's lab. Despite Leonard's apprehensions, Krank agrees to turn Spot human, gleefully anticipating the respect the scientific community has always denied him.\n\nSpot wakes up to find that he is indeed human, but because dogs age faster than humans , he is a fully grown man rather than a boy. Krank wants to capture and exhibit the \"dog-man\" around the world, but they break free. In need of a new wardrobe, \"Scott\" uses his dog senses to locate a lost dog and claim a cash reward, and he and Leonard enjoy a day on the town.\n\nScott and Leonard return to the RV to meet Mrs. Helperman, making up a story to explain the disappearance of Scott-the-boy and the appearance of Scott-the-man. Mrs. Helperman invites Scott in for coffee and soon begins to fall for him. Scott considers marrying Leonard's mother so they can all stay together, but Leonard refuses to allow it.

        "title": "Street Scene (opera)",
        "description": "Street Scene is an American opera by Kurt Weill (music), Langston Hughes (lyrics), and Elmer Rice ( book ). Written in 1946 and premiered in Philadelphia that year, Street Scene is based on the Pulitzer Prize -winning 1929 play of the same name by Rice.\n\nIt was Weill who referred to the piece as an \"American opera\", intending it as a groundbreaking synthesis of European traditional opera and American musical theater. He received the inaugural Tony Award for Best Original Score for his work, after the Broadway premiere in 1947. Considered far more an opera than a musical, Street Scene is regularly produced by professional opera companies and has never been revived on Broadway. Musically and culturally, even dramatically, the work inhabits the mid-ground between Weill's Threepenny Opera (1928) and Leonard Bernstein 's West Side Story (1957).\n\nThe score contains operatic arias and ensembles, some of them, such as Anna Maurrant's \"Somehow I Never Could Believe\" and Frank Maurrant's \"Let Things Be Like They Always Was\", with links and references to the style of Giacomo Puccini . It also has jazz and blues influences in \"I Got a Marble and a Star\" and \"Lonely House\" (see image). Some of the more Broadway-style musical numbers are \"Wrapped in a Ribbon and Tied in a Bow\", \"Wouldn't You Like to Be on Broadway?\" and \"Moon-faced, Starry-eyed\", an extended song-and-dance sequence. Benny Goodman and His Orchestra recorded \"Moon-Faced, Starry-Eyed\" with Johnny Mercer on the vocal in 1947. It was also recorded by the jazz vocal group The Hi-Lo's for their 1958 Columbia LP And All That Jazz .",
        "synopsis": "### Summary\n\nThe opera takes place on the doorstep of a tenement on the East Side of Manhattan on two brutally hot days in 1946. The story focuses on two plotlines: the romance between Rose Maurrant and her neighbor Sam Kaplan; and on the extramarital affair of Rose's mother, Anna, which is eventually discovered by Rose's irritable father, Frank. The show portrays the ordinary romances, squabbles and gossips of the neighbors, as the mounting tensions involving the Maurrant family eventually build into a tragedy of epic proportions.\n\n### Act 1\n\nAs the curtain rises, we are introduced to some of the residents of the apartment block where the action takes place. Emma Jones and Greta Fiorentino lament the incredible heatwave that is gripping New York (\"Ain't It Awful, the Heat?\"). They are joined by another neighbor Olga Olsen, who tells of the stress of dealing with her newborn baby and her husband Carl, and an old man, Abraham Kaplan, who sings of the murders and scandals in the press, whilst joining in with the opening number. Henry Davis, the janitor, enters from the basement and sings of his ambitions to greater things (\"I Got a Marble and a Star\"). Young Willie Maurrant enters and calls for his mother, who enters at the window and throws him a dime to buy a soda. The three women (Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Fiorentino and Mrs. Olsen) persuade Mrs. Maurrant to come downstairs and be sociable, and as she descends, they gossip about the rumour that Mrs. Maurrant and Steve Sankey, the milkman, have been having an affair (\"Get a Load of that\"). Mrs. Maurrant comes down to chat and Mrs. Olsen goes back down to her cellar apartment to tend to her baby. Sam Kaplan comes out of the house and asks after Mrs. Maurrant's daughter, Rose, but she has not got back from work yet. He leaves to go to the library.\n\nDaniel Buchanan enters, jittery; he is nervous because his wife is upstairs about to have a baby. He and the women sing of the perils of childbirth in a short arietta, \"When a Woman Has a Baby\". Just as he runs upstairs to tend to his wife, Mrs. Maurrant's husband Frank comes home. He mentions that he is going on a business trip to New Haven tomorrow, and argues with his wife about Rose not being home yet (\"She Shouldn't Be Staying out Nights\"). Fuming, he storms into the house, just as George Jones returns home from work and chats with the ladies for a while. Anna Maurrant sings an aria about the importance of putting your faith in a brighter tomorrow (\"Somehow I Never Could Believe\"). Steve Sankey enters and a tense scene ensues between him and the suspecting women. Almost immediately after he departs, Mrs. Maurrant heads off in the same direction, under the guise of going to look for her son. Mr. Jones, Mr. Olsen, Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Fiorentino sing more about the scandal (\"Whatcha Think of That\"). Mrs. Olsen runs in excited and says that she has just seen Sankey and Mrs. Maurrant standing close together around the back of a local warehouse.\n\nLippo Fiorentino returns home from work with an armful of ice cream cones for everybody. The two Fiorentinos, the two Olsens, Mr. Jones and Henry Davis sing a jubilant sextet praising ice cream (\"Ice Cream Sextet\"). Maurrant has been watching, and when his wife comes back he questions her about where she has been. She tells him she has been looking for Willie, and Maurrant and Abraham Kaplan argue about parenting, and later economics. Kaplan uses the example of the Hildebrand family who live upstairs, who are run by a struggling single mother who is unable to pay the rent, to illustrate his point. Maurrant and Kaplan's argument almost becomes physical, but the neighbors and Kaplan's granddaughter Shirley hold the two men back. Maurrant sings about how he longs for a return to traditional moral values in \"Let Things Be Like they Always Was\". Immediately after, Jennie Hildebrand and other high-school girls enter the street coming home from their graduation ceremony. The ensemble sings a jubilant celebration number, \"Wrapped in a Ribbon and Tied in a Bow\". Steve Sankey's entrance causes an abrupt end to the celebrations. After the awkward silence of the neighbors forces him to leave, Sam brings Willie Maurrant on in tears. Willie has been fighting with a local kid and Sam stepped in to break it up. Mr. Maurrant leaves to go to the local bar to have a drink, warning that there'll be trouble if Rose is not home by the time he gets back, whilst Mrs. Maurrant takes Willie upstairs. As soon as they leave, the neighbors all begin gossiping about the Maurrant family. Sam gets passionately upset, chiding the neighbors for gossiping so much behind their backs, and then storms off.\n\nAll the neighbors say goodnight and go to bed, except Mr. Jones, who goes to the bar to shoot some pool. Sam returns onstage and sings of his crippling loneliness (\"Lonely House\"). Sam goes into the house, then Rose enters with her boss, Harry Easter, who has walked her home. Easter attempts to charm Rose, taking her in his arms and kissing her. He then tries to win her over with a tempting song, promising her that if she were to run away with him he could get her a gig on Broadway (\"Wouldn't You Like to Be on Broadway?\"). Rose, however, sticks to her convictions, and sings a Cavatina about how she will always choose true love over showy promises (\"What Good Would the Moon Be?\"). Rose sees her father returning home and tells Easter to leave. Maurrant questions her about who she was talking to, and gets angry when she tells him that they had been out dancing. He goes upstairs to bed, furious. Buchanan rushes out of the house and asks Rose to go and phone the doctor, as his wife's baby is about to be born. He heads back upstairs, and as Rose is leaving, she passes young Mae Jones and her suitor, Dick McGann. The two have been out dancing and are flirting, and they sing a fast-paced jitterbug about their infatuation with one another (\"Moon-faced, Starry-eyed\"). After they dance on the sidewalk, they passionately run upstairs into the house, after saying a drunken good-night to Rose, who has returned from phoning the doctor.\n\nMae's brutish elder brother Vincent returns home, and begins harassing Rose. Sam sees him hassling her out of the window, and comes outside to confront him, however Vincent violently lays him out on the sidewalk. Vincent is about to continue his attack when his mother, Mrs. Jones, comes outside to see what the commotion is. He immediately seizes up and innocently goes upstairs at his mother's order. Sam and Rose are left alone, and Sam is embarrassed that he was humiliated by Vincent in front of Rose. Sam laments the terrible strife of living in the slums, but Rose calms him down by reminding him of a poem he once read her (\"Remember that I Care\"). Dr. Wilson arrives and goes upstairs to tend to Mrs. Buchanan, and Mr. Maurrant calls Rose and tells her to go to bed. Sam and Rose share a kiss on the sidewalk, and then Rose runs up to bed, just as Henry Davis comes upstairs and starts sweeping the stoop for the night (\"I Got a Marble and a Star (reprise)\"). Rose calls goodnight to Sam from the window and Sam is left alone on the midnight street as the curtain slowly falls to end Act 1.\n\n### Act 2\n\nScene 1: Daybreak, the next morning\n\nMr. Jones drunkenly returns home from the bar and reels into the stinky house. Dr. Wilson leaves the house, telling Buchanan to let his wife get plenty of rest, and Dick McGann and Mae Jones share a much less passionate goodbye in the cold light of day than their energetic exchanges the night before. Willie Maurrant, Charlie and Mary Hildebrand, Henry's daughter Grace, and other local children play an energetic game (\"Catch Me if You Can\"), which ends in a large scuffle. Rose calls for them to stop it from the window, whilst Sam comes outside and physically breaks the fight up. The children all disperse. Sam and Rose have a brief conversation, as Rose tells him that she has to go to the funeral of the head of her real estate firm this morning. Shirley comes outside and tells Sam to come in for breakfast, as Rose goes back inside to do the dishes. Buchanan comes outside and tells the Fiorentino's that he has had a little baby girl in the night. Mrs. Jones and Mrs. Maurrant enter, and Mrs. Jones asks her about Mrs. Buchanan, who Mrs. Maurrant has been looking after all night. Mrs. Jones leaves to walk her dog, and Mrs. Maurrant leaves to go to the grocery store. Rose and Mr. Maurrant come out of the house and Rose tries to persuade him to be nicer to her mother. Mrs. Maurrant returns and the three have a family argument about Mr. Maurrant's behaviour. Mrs. Maurrant asks him nonchalantly how long he will be gone on his business trip for, and Mr. Maurrant accuses her of having an affair, which she denies. He leaves in a rage, and Mrs. Maurrant and Rose lament his behaviour (\"There'll Be Trouble\"). Willie comes on and Rose chides him for looking scruffy. Willie and Rose have a verbal disagreement and Rose quickly storms into the house. Mrs. Maurrant tells him that that is no way to talk to his sister, and that she is relying on him to turn into a good man when he is older (\"A Boy Like You\"). Willie leaves for school and Mrs. Maurrant goes into the house, as Rose comes out. Shirley Kaplan comes out of the house and asks Rose why she spends so much time with Sam, when he should be concentrating on his work. Shirley leaves for work, and Vincent Jones comes out of the house and starts harassing Rose again, but promptly leaves as Sam comes out of the house. Rose mentions Easter's tempting offer of running away to Sam, and Sam gets upset, saying that she would be better off running away with him, and the two sing of their intention to run away together (\"We'll Go Away Together\"). Easter arrives to walk Rose to the funeral, and the two leave. Sam goes into the house, as Sankey appears. Mrs. Maurrant appears at her window and tells him to come upstairs, as Mr. Maurrant has gone on his business trip and Rose will be at the funeral all morning. As Sankey hurries upstairs he passes Sam coming out of the house, who looks up at the window and sees Mrs. Maurrant pulling the shades shut. Sam sits on the stoop and reads a book, as James Henry, a city-marshall, and Fred Cullen, his assistant, appear. They call Henry Davis up and tell him that they are here to dispossess the Hildebrand family, and that since she has made no arrangements to have the furniture taken away, they will have to dump it on the sidewalk. Henry goes back into the cellar as the two men enter the house. Mr. Maurrant returns, having changed his mind about the business trip. He sees the shades pulled shut and becomes furious. Sam pleads with him not to enter the house but he pushes him aside and runs upstairs. Mrs. Maurrant is heard screaming, and then two gunshots. Sankey appears at the window in terror, he tries to escape but Maurrant pulls him back inside and shoots him. Panic ensues, as Maurrant exits the house, covered in blood, and points his revolver at the crowd of gatherers in order to make his escape. Policemen, paramedics, concerned neighbors flood the scene. Rose returns from the funeral and sees the concerned crowd. Sam tries to keep her back but she cannot be restrained. The ensemble sings a tragic chorus number about the killing, \"The Woman Who Lived up There\". Mrs. Maurrant's body is brought out of the house on a stretcher and taken to the hospital and the citizens rush after the ambulance, as Rose, quietly crying in Sam's arms, follows. The curtain slowly falls as the two city-marshalls continue bringing the Hildebrand furniture out onto the sidewalk.\n\nScene 2: Mid-afternoon, the same day\n\nTwo young nursemaids appear at the house and sing about the scandal of the murder that has already spread around the city, as they try to quiet the children they are looking after (\"Lullaby\"). As the nursemaids leave, Rose enters, dressed in black. She asks Officer Murphy, the policeman who is still in her apartment, if they have found her father yet, and he tells her that they have not. Sam enters and tells Rose that he has taken Willie from school round to her aunt's house. Shirley enters and expresses her condolences to Rose, and the two of them go up to Rose's apartment together, as Rose is afraid to go up alone. Sam tells his grandfather that the police are going to make him testify against Maurrant, when two shots are heard in the distance. Buchanan and Olsen run on and tell Sam and Rose (who has run out of the house, alerted by the noise) that the police have found her father hiding in the basement of a house down the street. Two policemen bring on Maurrant, who is covered in blood and dirt. The officers are taking him away when he begs for one minute with his daughter, which they grant him. He and Rose talk about the murder, as the crowd looks on (\"He Loved Her Too\"). The officers take Maurrant off, and Rose and Sam are left alone onstage. Rose starts to enter the house when Sam asks what she is going to do. She tells him she will go away, but when he says that he will go with her as they discussed that morning, Rose says she has to go off alone. Sam finally confesses to Rose that he is in love with her, and that his life is nothing without her. Rose says that her parents have proved that two people do not belong together, and she says goodbye to Sam (\"Don't Forget the Lilac Bush\"). Shirley comes out of the house and hands Rose a suitcase full of her things. Rose starts walking off, then returns and swiftly kisses Sam, but he breaks away and goes abruptly into the house. Rose stands looking after him, then picks up her bag and walks off. Mrs. Fiorentino, Mrs. Olsen and Mrs. Jones appear and immediately begin gossiping about Rose and Easter hanging around on the street late last night (\"Ain't It Awful, the Heat? (reprise)\"), as they once again lament the unbearable heat and the curtain slowly falls.",

        "title": "Willy Wonka (musical)",
        "description": "Roald Dahl's Willy Wonka , also known simply as Willy Wonka , is a musical with music and lyrics by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley and a book by Bricusse and Timothy Allen McDonald. It is based on the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl . The musical was commissioned by Music Theatre International and is licensed for performance by amateur theatre groups.",
        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nWilly Wonka introduces himself to the audience and summons his Oompa-Loompa workers, announcing that he is retiring and he must choose a new successor when he does (\" Pure Imagination \" / \"The Golden Age of Chocolate\"). Wonka, acting as narrator, introduces the impoverished Bucket family: Mr. and Mrs. Bucket, their young son Charlie, and Charlie's four bedridden grandparents, Grandpa George, Grandma Georgina, Grandpa Joe, and Grandma Josephine. Grandpa Joe assures Charlie that he is destined to work for Wonka making candy, just like he did when he was younger. However, Wonka fired all his workers years ago after one of his candy recipes had been stolen and sold to his competitors and locked the gates of his factory forever. Mysteriously, however, the factory has continued to produce candy. However, nobody ever goes in and nobody ever comes out.\n\nA group of children gather outside Charlie's house, each clutching a nickel to buy a Wonka bar from the candy shop (\" The Candy Man \"). Charlie is the only child too poor to buy any candy, but the candy shop owner treats him to a lollipop and a copy of yesterday's newspaper. Charlie takes the paper home, and the Buckets learn from it that Wonka has announced a contest where five lucky children will go on a tour of his factory and get a lifetime supply of chocolate at the end if they find one of five Golden Tickets hidden in Wonka Bars.\n\nThe first ticket is found in Frankfurt , Germany by Augustus Gloop, an obese, gluttonous German boy (\"I Eat More!\"). The second ticket is found in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil , by an extremely spoiled girl named Veruca Salt. Her wealthy father, a macadamia nut magnate, had purchased hundreds of thousands of the candy bars and put his entire factory workforce to work searching for the ticket. As the search continues, Mr. Bucket loses his job at the toothpaste factory. Charlie encourages him not to give up hope (\"Think Positive\"). On Charlie's birthday, his family gives him a Wonka Bar for a present. Everyone manages to suppress their disappointment when Charlie unwraps the bar and finds no Golden Ticket.\n\nThe third ticket is found in Snellville, Georgia , by Violet Beauregarde, an abrasive girl who is constantly chewing gum. The fourth ticket is found in Television City , California, by Mike Teavee, a boy who seems more interested in television, video games, and cell phones than touring Wonka's factory (\"I See it All on TV\"). That night, before Charlie goes to bed, Grandpa Joe reveals that he has secretly purchased another Wonka Bar for Charlie. They open the bar together, but it contains only chocolate. The Buckets tell Charlie not to be discouraged (\"Cheer Up, Charlie\").\n\nAs winter approaches, the Buckets' situation is becoming increasingly desperate. Charlie is helping the candy shop owner pack his wares when he finds a silver dollar on the ground. He assumes that it must belong to the shop owner and tries to return it, but the owner tells Charlie to bring it home to his family. He also gives Charlie a Wonka Bar as a reward for his honesty. Charlie buys another Wonka Bar to share with his family. He unwraps the bar and finds the last ticket. He runs home to his family and reads the ticket aloud, saying that the tour is tomorrow and he can only bring one family member with him to the factory. Charlie chooses Grandpa Joe to accompany him on the factory tour, prompting Joe to get out of the bed for the first time in years. (\"(I've) Got a Golden Ticket\").\n\n### Act Two\n\nThe five winners and their chaperones are gathered at the factory gates where Wonka makes a spectacular entrance (\"Pure Imagination\" (reprise)). Wonka greets each child (apart from Charlie, each one is insufferable in his or her own way). Wonka forces everyone to sign an elaborate and cryptic contract before beginning the tour. The tour finally begins, and Wonka describes a dizzying array of fabulous chambers and exotic rooms, each devoted to the creation of various sweets and treats (\"In This Room Here\").\n\nWonka leads the tour group through a chamber in which the walls and ceiling appear to be closing in around them, and they appear in the Chocolate Room. Wonka introduces his workers, the Oompa-Loompas. Augustus sneezes into the chocolate river and is sucked into a large pipe. Wonka, with little apparent concern, directs the Oompa-Loompas to take Mrs. Gloop to the Strawberry-Dipping Room and retrieve Augustus. The Oompa-Loompas share a moral message about the dangers of gluttony (\"Oompa-Loompa One\").\n\nWonka and the remaining guests board a pink candy boat. Veruca Salt demands that her father buy her both the boat and one of the Oompa-Loompas. Salt attempts to buy them from Wonka, but Wonka is unimpressed. The boat ride then turns into a psychedelic nightmare as Wonka navigates them through what appears to be a tour of the darker aspects of human imagination, complete with frightening projected images (\"There's No Knowing\"). Wonka laughs maniacally and the others scream with horror until the boat abruptly vanishes and the party finds themselves in Wonka's Inventing Room.\n\nIn the Inventing Room, Wonka reveals one of his creations. A three-course meal in a piece of gum. Heedless of Wonka's half-hearted warnings that the gum is not yet perfected, Violet is unable to resist it (\"Chew It\") and blows up into a blueberry and is taken to the Juicing Room to be squeezed before she explodes. The Oompa-Loompas share a warning about the evils of excessive gum-chewing (\"Oompa-Loompa Two\").\n\nWonka and the remaining guests proceed to the Fizzy Lifting Drink Room, which is filled with bubbles. Wonka informs everyone that the drink will cause the imbiber to float, but forbids anyone to partake. Charlie and Grandpa Joe linger behind after the others leave, and the Oompa-Loompas tempt them to sample the drink. They do so, and immediately rise into the air (\"Flying\"). They soon find that they're in danger of being sucked into a giant fan on the roof of the room. However, they discover that burping reverses the effects of the drink, and, via a series of belches, they are able to descend back to the ground (\"Burping Song\").\n\nCharlie and Grandpa Joe rejoin the others in the Nut Room, where a team of squirrels is busy sorting good nuts from bad nuts. Veruca immediately demands a squirrel, and launches into an extended spoiled tantrum (\"I Want it Now\"). She is deemed a \"Bad Nut\" and falls down one of the sorting shoots, pursued immediately by her father. The Oompa-Loompas share a moral about the ills of spoiling children (\"Oompa-Loompa Three\"). \nWonka and the dwindling group proceed to the Choco-Vision Room where he is currently developing an experimental process for transmitting chocolate via television. He explains how to activate the experimental machinery but warns everyone not to do so. Mike immediately activates the equipment and transports himself via television signal. This results in his being shrunk to tiny size. Wonka directs that he be taken to the taffy-pulling machine and stretched out. The Oompa-Loompas warn of the perils of excessive television viewing (\"Oompa-Loompa Four\").\n\nWith only Charlie and Grandpa Joe remaining, Wonka abruptly announces that the tour is over. He pronounces that the day has been \"a total waste of time and chocolate.\" Before going, Charlie confesses that he and Grandpa Joe tasted the Fizzy-Lifting Drinks, and states that he therefore does not deserve the lifetime supply of chocolate he was promised. He apologizes to Wonka and thanks him for the tour. Wonka stops Charlie from leaving and announces that the entire competition was devised with the goal of finding his successor, and that Charlie's behavior and performance prove that he should take over the factory. Wonka then takes them for a ride in the Great Glass Elevator (\"Flying\", reprise).\n\nAugustus, Violet, Veruca and Mike appear, restored to their former selves, and join the Oompa-Loompas in praising the virtue of honesty (\"Oompa-Loompa Five\"). Wonka informs Charlie that his entire family is welcome to come and live at the factory. Charlie is delighted to take on his new role as Wonka's handpicked successor (\"Finale\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn 1933, right before the end of Prohibition , Chicago speakeasy performer Sweet Sue is arrested in a raid (\"What Are You Thirsty For?\"). After being bailed out of jail, Sue decides to form an all-female band that will tour the western U.S., playing its final engagement in San Diego . Meanwhile, the club's saxophonist Joe and bass player Jerry, desperately in need of a paycheck, seeks out a job with Spats Colombo, the proprietor of the Cheetah Club and a powerful gangster. Colombo's hiring manager is impressed by Joe and Jerry's musical abilities, but only offers to hire Joe; the manager is prejudiced against Black people and therefore refuses to hire Jerry. Joe and Jerry explain that Jerry's parents raised Joe after his own outlaw parents abandoned him, and as such, they come as a package deal (\"You Can't Have Me (If You Don't Have Him)\"). Colombo, impressed by their tap dancing act, \"The Tip-Tap Twins\", agrees to hire them both.\n\nThat evening, Colombo receives a tip from FBI Agent Mulligan that he will be arrested imminently if he doesn't turn state's evidence . Suspecting he has been betrayed, Colombo calls Toothpick Charlie and two of his associates into his office and has them shot. At this moment, Joe and Jerry walk in and witness the murder. Fleeing from Colombo\u2019s goons, the pair find themselves in a women's dressing room. Joe makes a plan: he and Jerry will disguise themselves as women and join Sweet Sue's band to get to San Diego, then flee to Mexico . Jerry is doubtful that Joe's plan will work, but seeing no alternative, he goes along with the plan. (\"Vamp!\")\n\nThe next day, Joe and Jerry arrive at the train station as the band is departing, posing as two music students named Josephine and Daphne. Sweet Sue hires them to replace the original sax and bass player, whose instruments were dumped in the river by Joe and Jerry. The last to arrive is the band's singer, Sugar Kane (\"I'm California Bound\"). On the train, Sugar confesses to Josephine and Daphne that she is joining the all-female band because of her weakness for male musicians, particularly saxophone players (\"A Darker Shade of Blue\").\n\nAs the show travels west, Josephine, Daphne and Sugar develop a new version of the Tip-Tap Twins act, \"The Tip-Tap Trio.\" (\"Take It Up A Step\") Joe, who struggles to fit in as Josephine, marvels at Jerry\u2019s ease in behaving femininely as he leads the girls in telling off a greedy bar manager (\"Zee Bap\"). Sugar and Josephine grow closer, and Sugar shares her childhood dreams of movie stardom (\"At the Old Majestic Nickel Matinee\"). Joe begins to fall for Sugar. Meanwhile, Colombo recognizes the Tip-Tap Trio as Joe and Jerry's act.\n\nThe band arrives at the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego. The hotel's owner, Osgood Fielding III, an eccentric millionaire in search of love, takes an immediate interest in Daphne (\"Poor Little Millionaire\"). Joe insists to Jerry that they flee to Mexico immediately, but Jerry doesn't want to leave the band yet, feeling more at home as Daphne than he ever has. Joe attempts to escape alone by stealing the luggage of Austrian screenwriter Kip von der Plotz, but bumps into Sugar. Impersonating Kip, he woos her, and she invites him to see her perform that evening. When Kip shows up in place of Josephine that night, Sugar and Daphne perform the act as a duo. Daphne angrily eyes \"Kip\" from the stage while Osgood admires her. Colombo arrives in town, with Agent Mulligan hot on his tail (\"Some Like It Hot\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe performance ends, and Kip invites Sugar out after the show. Sweet Sue storms into Josephine and Daphne's room, demanding to know why Josephine missed the performance. Still dressed as Kip from the shoulders down but covered by a blanket, Josephine explains that she was waylaid by food poisoning . Osgood visits Daphne, and Josephine convinces him to take Daphne out so \"Kip\" can use his yacht without Osgood knowing. Osgood convinces a reluctant Daphne to come with him to Mexico, and Daphne receives a makeover from the other girls (\"Let's Be Bad\"). On the yacht, Sugar falls in love with Kip and teaches him how to dance, fantasizing about the movies they\u2019d make together (\"Let's Dance the World Away\").\n\nIn Mexico, Osgood explains to Daphne that his father, Osgood Fielding II, was disowned by Osgood I for falling in love with a Mexican barmaid, Osgood's mother. Though Osgood II regained his fortune by inventing root beer , it left Osgood III with a feeling of a dual identity, his Mexican name being Pedro Francisco Alvarez. Daphne is inspired by his allegorical story about a caterpillar becoming a butterfly , and Osgood proposes (\"Fly, Mariposa, Fly\").\n\nReturning early the next morning, Daphne tells Joe that she is both Jerry and Daphne and that she is engaged to Osgood (\"You Could've Knocked Me Over With a Feather\"). Daphne also encourages Joe to be honest with himself. Realizing that Sugar can never love someone she doesn't know, Joe resolves to be a better friend to Daphne and tell Sugar the truth (\"He Lied When He Said Hello\"). Sweet Sue introduces the band to their new investor, Colombo, and later walks in on Joe out of disguise. They explain the whole story, and she agrees to keep their secret until the end of the show, at which point they will flee to Mexico. Sue also encourages Joe to let Sugar down easy without endangering her life.\n\nJosephine informs Sugar that Kip left a note breaking up with her . Heartbroken and with her dream in tatters, Sugar nevertheless performs (\"Ride Out the Storm\"). Colombo and his associates recognize the trio's dancing and Joe unmasks himself, stunning Sugar. The gangsters and the FBI chase the trio through the hotel. Eventually, Agent Mulligan, dressed as Josephine, is able to corner and arrest Colombo (\"Tip-Tap Trouble\"). Joe testifies against Colombo without implicating Daphne.\n\nSugar is furious at Joe's multiple deceptions, but she comes to realize that she did have real affection for Josephine and Kip and does indeed love Joe.

        "title": "Jersey Boys",
        "description": "Jersey Boys is a jukebox musical with a book by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice . It is presented in a documentary -style format that dramatizes the formation, success and breakup of the 1960s rock 'n' roll group the Four Seasons . The musical is structured as four \"seasons\", each narrated by a different member of the band who gives his own perspective on its history and music. Songs include \" Big Girls Don't Cry \", \" Sherry \", \" December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night) \", \" My Eyes Adored You \", \" Stay \", \" Can't Take My Eyes Off You \", \" Walk Like A Man \", \" Who Loves You \", \" Working My Way Back to You \" and \" Rag Doll \".\n\nThe musical premiered at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2004 and ran on Broadway from 2005 to 2017. Since its debut it has been on two North American national tours and two national tours of the UK and Ireland. The show has been produced in London's West End , Amstetten , Las Vegas, Chicago, Toronto, Melbourne and other Australian cities, Singapore, South Africa, the Netherlands, Japan, Dubai, and China. Jersey Boys won four 2006 Tony Awards , including Best Musical, and the 2009 Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Musical .\n\nThe musical spawned a film adaptation in 2014 .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\n\" Ces soir\u00e9es-l\u00e0 \" is performed. Tommy DeVito introduces himself and explains that the song, a number-one hit in France in 2000, is an adaptation of \" December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night) \", a song his group, The Four Seasons, originated. He begins to tell the band's story, explaining that each of the four members has his own version, but that they all begin on a streetcorner in Belleville, New Jersey , in the early 1950s (\" Silhouettes \").\n\nTommy is a member of the cover group \" The Variety Trio \" with his brother Nick DeVito and friend Nick Massi (\"You're the Apple of My Eye\"). They bring on Frankie Castelluccio (\"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\"), whom Tommy takes under his wing. The DeVito brothers are sent to Rahway Prison for a robbery (\" Earth Angel \"), leaving Frankie in the care of Massi, who works with him on vocal technique (\" A Sunday Kind of Love \") until Massi is himself taken to Rahway for a parole violation. Once Tommy is released, he rejoins Frankie, reluctantly setting Frankie up with Mary Delgado, who convinces Frankie to change his last name (which he had intended to change to \"Valley\") to the more Italian \"Valli;\" Mary and Frankie soon marry. A year later, Frankie falls prey to a fake murder scam, which Tommy defuses by calling his boss, mobster Gyp DeCarlo; Frankie is pressured into singing a song he had not done since age 15 (\"My Mother's Eyes\") and pleases DeCarlo, who offers a \"claim check\" for any future favor. Tommy constantly changes the group's name, lineup and style in an effort to keep up with fads, playing in small clubs to almost no success; one particular incident has the trio adding comedian Hank Majewski, whose monkey act (\"I Go Ape\") ends in disaster. One day, while running a pin-setting scam at a bowling alley, Tommy's co-conspirator Joe Pesci introduces the group to a singer-songwriter from Bergenfield who he thinks will be a great fit: Bob Gaudio.\n\nBob takes over the narration, telling the audience that he already had a hit single with \" Short Shorts \" and not to believe Tommy plucked him from obscurity. Bob goes with Joe to see the band perform, and is immediately impressed by Frankie's voice on \" Moody's Mood for Love \". In an on-the-spot audition, Bob plays his song \"Cry for Me\" with the band and agrees to join if he is granted equal partnership and gets to keep his songwriting rights, to which Tommy (at Frankie and Nick's prodding) grudgingly agrees. One weekend, Bob takes Frankie to the Brill Building and secures a session musician contract with Bob Crewe (\"Backup Sessions\"). Crewe insists that the band, upset at the poor pay and not being able to record their own material, has an \"identity crisis\" and needs to make a firm decision on a name, which they take from the same alley where Tommy was running his scam (leading the owner to chase them off when the band tries to audition): the Four Seasons.\n\nCrewe schedules the group's first true recording session, and minutes before it begins, Bob writes their breakthrough hit: \" Sherry \", which explodes in popularity after a disc jockey named Barry Belson plays the song repeatedly . Bob's fears of again being relegated to one-hit wonder status are eased when \" Big Girls Don't Cry \" and \" Walk Like a Man \" follow \"Sherry\" to the top and establish their audience as the young American working class. With the band's newfound success, Bob cuts Frankie in on his songwriting royalties, while Nick takes Bob under his wing, helping him buy a new Cadillac and setting him up with a woman at a Christmas party, to whom Bob loses his virginity (\" December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night) \"). The band takes on a new opening act, the New Jersey girl group The Angels (\" My Boyfriend's Back \"), who become the band's paramours; meanwhile, Tommy has racked up a personal debt to the loan sharks in the tens of thousands of dollars. Frankie's constant touring and his wife Mary's alcoholism eventually lead them to divorce (\" My Eyes Adored You \"). The band survives the British Invasion (\" Dawn (Go Away) \"), and Bob begins looking toward the future when loan shark Norm Waxman confronts Tommy and the band after a concert to collect Tommy's unpaid debt of $150,000 (\"Walk Like a Man (reprise)\").\n\n### Act II\n\nNick, taking over as narrator, backtracks the story to cover some incidents Bob had overlooked, explaining that Bob never forgave Tommy after an unpaid hotel bill landed the quartet in jail after an Ohio concert appearance (\" Big Man in Town \") and Frankie lost respect for Tommy after Tommy attempted to make a pass at Frankie's new girlfriend, Lorraine; in revenge, Tommy escalated his gambling even further until Waxman calls in the debt. Frankie redeems his claim check with DeCarlo (\" Beggin' \") to resolve Tommy's debts. At a basement meeting with the Seasons, Waxman and DeCarlo, Nick, Frankie and Bob each call Tommy out on his faults, nearly leading to fistcuffs. Bob suggests the remaining trio buy out Tommy's share to pay the debt (now at $662,000 after a vigorish and the band's taxes that Tommy also never paid are added), with Waxman insisting Tommy be placed in Las Vegas under the mob's watch as collateral ; Frankie agrees to it and overrules Nick's opposition. Nick, who had earlier expressed private dismay when finding out about Frankie and Bob's side deal, makes his frustrations known to the remaining duo and abruptly quits (\" Stay \"), explaining that fame had taken a severe toll on his family life and that he needed to return home.\n\nFrankie takes over narration (\" Let's Hang On! \"), admitting he had tolerated Tommy's embezzling out of loyalty, but that he was hurt and baffled by Nick's departure (\" Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me) \"). Frankie and Bob hire replacements to keep the band a quartet, fellow New Jersey natives Charlie Calello and Joe Long , but Frankie balks when Bob wants to hire a replacement for himself and a new drummer so he can move into a background role; they compromise, as Bob agrees to stay and Frankie takes on a solo side project to make more money. Back in New Jersey, Frankie's daughter Francine has run away to the city, prompting renewed fighting between Frankie, Mary and Francine; when Frankie asks Lorraine to take Francine in, she refuses and breaks up with him (\" Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby, Goodbye) \"). As the band embarks on a grueling tour to cover the debt, they strike their next hit \" C'mon Marianne \" but find resistance with Frankie's first solo record; Crewe teaches Bob some industry tricks to leverage \"C'Mon Marianne\" and make \" Can't Take My Eyes Off You \" a huge hit. Along with the success of \" Working My Way Back to You \", Frankie and Bob finally pay off Tommy's debts, and Frankie's life is peaceful for the next several years until Francine suddenly dies from a drug overdose (\" Fallen Angel \").\n\nCrewe introduces a reunited Four Seasons at their Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1990 (\" Rag Doll \"); at the reunion, Tommy mentions his new life after settling in Las Vegas and invites Frankie, who looks forward to a second chance at fatherhood with three young sons, to a party in Nick's suite, which Frankie ultimately cannot bring himself to join. Each band member closes with a monologue explaining their lives at the time Jersey Boys was written: Tommy works for Joe Pesci and was welcomed back to Belleville as its Man of the Year; Bob has married and retired to Nashville, Tennessee while stying in touch with Frankie regarding the band's business affairs; Nick stayed in New Jersey with his children, occasionally sitting in with Frankie when the band played there, until he died on Christmas Eve in 2000; and Frankie continues to tour, reflecting that the band's streetcorner days were his favorite and that he continues \"chasing the music, trying to get home\" (\" Who Loves You \").",

A touring production began in late 2013 through the South and Midwest. A soundtrack was released featuring country , folk , and rock musicians.\n\nThe story is a Southern Gothic tale of two brothers who hate each other and are forced by their father to spend time in a haunted cabin, where they are visited by the ghosts of dead brothers who also hated each other.",
        "synopsis": "Describing the plot, Mellencamp said, \"I can tell what it's not going to be like: It won't be ' Jack and Diane ' meets Cujo . He's [King] already written the story\u2014it's very beautiful, more like The Green Mile . It's an American story about an American family. Some of the characters are 100 years old, some are 15. So that will give me the opportunity to write for each character in a different style. I ain't writing a bunch of rock songs.\"\n\nIn a later interview he said, \"[It's about] two brothers; they're 19 years old or 20, maybe 18 or 21, who are very competitive and dislike each other immensely. The father takes them to the family vacation place, a cabin that the boys hadn't been to since they were kids. What has happened is that the father had two older brothers who hated each other and killed each other in that cabin. There's a confederacy of ghosts who also live in this house. The older [dead] brothers are there, and they speak to the audience, and they sing to the audience. That's all I want to say, except through this family vacation, many things are learned about the family, and many interesting songs are sung.\"\n\nThe official production synopsis reads: \"In the tiny town of Lake Belle Reve, Mississippi in 1967, a terrible tragedy took the lives of two brothers and a beautiful young girl. During the next forty years, the events of that night became the stuff of local legend. But legend is often just another word for lie. Joe McCandless knows what really happened; he saw it all. The question is whether or not he can bring himself to tell the truth in time to save his own troubled sons, and whether the ghosts left behind by an act of violence will help him\u2014or tear the McCandless family apart forever.\"",

Other directors that are claimed to have made uncredited contributions to the film are Merrill Pye , Norman Taurog , and Charles Walters . It stars many MGM leading talents, including Fred Astaire , Lucille Ball , Lucille Bremer , Fanny Brice (the only member of the ensemble who was a star of the original Follies), Judy Garland , Kathryn Grayson , Lena Horne , Gene Kelly , James Melton , Victor Moore , William Powell , Red Skelton , and Esther Williams .\n\nProducer Arthur Freed wanted to create a film along the lines of the Ziegfeld Follies Broadway shows, and so the film is composed of a sequence of unrelated lavish musical numbers and comedy sketches. Some of them, such as Pay the Two Dollars , originated in George White's Scandals . Filmed in 1944 and 1945, it was released in 1946 to considerable critical and box-office success.\n\nThe film was entered into the 1947 Cannes Film Festival .",
        "synopsis": "The movie opens with the camera panning over a Heaven somewhere beyond the sky. The residences of great showmen gone to their eternal reward are shown: Shakespeare , whose home looks like the Globe Theater ; P.T.Barnum , whose residence in the afterlife resembles a circus Big Top; and Florenz Ziegfeld , whose home's entrance is reminiscent of the theater where he staged the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway.\n\nTalking to the audience, Ziegfeld guides the viewers along a wall with three-dimensional paintings or shadow boxes containing dolls that look like the stars he cast in his Follies over the years. The film dissolves into a stop-motion puppet sequence as Ziegfeld provides a voice-over of the opening of one of his shows.\n\nFollowing this, he steps out onto a balcony, musing how he wishes he could stage just one more Follies, with current and past stars in the cast. A Higher Power causes a cigar-sized crayon and a sheet of parchment to appear, and Ziegfeld begins to write. As he does so, the skits and performance numbers appear on the screen.",

At the same time, Eadie is preparing a dance number for the college's annual Greek festival. All of these time conflicts cause her grades to slip, so she pressures Pamela Parker, a classmate, into doing her schoolwork for her.  A series of hijinks where Eadie's double life is almost discovered by the dean of the college (Dean Flint) leads her to hand Tommy her resignation from the burlesque bar.\nTommy convinces Eadie to perform one last time at a hotel. Catching wind of this, Eadie's jealous and jilted former co-dancer (Rose Allure) arranges for the police to raid the performance. The raid leads to both Eadie and Dean Flint being implicated in participation with the lewd event, and this almost has them expelled from their respective positions in the college. Rose confesses to Tommy that she set up the raid, and so Tommy disguises himself as the head of the Athens Art Theater, \"Professor Nozoros.\" He uses this pretense to defend both the dean and Eadie to the board of director of Glen Moor, by saying that they were at the burlesque performance to perform research for the Greek festival.

Fanny and her confidant Bobby Moore are now out of work since Florenz Ziegfeld is not available to produce a new musical show. During a meeting with Bernard Baruch , her financial advisor, she meets his former secretary Billy Rose. When Fanny and Bobby go into nightclubs looking for material to \"borrow\", they hear a torch song in \"More Than You Know\" that was written by Rose. Although irritated by his pushy nature in trying to sell the song to her, Fanny soon records the song at a studio before being shocked to read in the newspaper that she will star in a show to be mounted by Rose called Crazy Quilt.\n\nThe show ends up getting $50,000 from Buck Bolton when Rose promises to cast Bolton's mistress Norma Butler as one of the stars. Despite having a big number for Fanny in \u201cI Found A Million Dollar Baby In A Five And Ten Cents Store\u201d, opening night proves to be a disaster in terms of collapsing sets and more. Fanny considers leaving the production but stays when hearing that Billy borrowed money from mobsters that would kill him if he can't make the money back. The two work together to scale down the show. The improved show opens in New York to applause and great reviews before Fanny sees Nicky backstage with a ring on his finger from a rich woman, to whom he's now married. Billy, ready to travel to Fort Worth, Texas for a new show, offers to marry Fanny beforehand. She accepts only to find that Billy was bluffing about borrowing money from the mob to keep her close.\n\nThe wedding party finds Billy treated roughly by Fanny's society friends before the honeymoon in Texas turns to bickering between the newlyweds. During the next few years their careers are so busy that they only talk to each other when they telephone their publicist at the same time. Billy does a show called Aquacade , featuring Eleanor Holm , a 1932 Olympic swim gold medalist as the star. Later on, Fanny encounters Bobby Moore and Norma Butler in Los Angeles and sees Nicky on the field of a polo game in Beverly Hills and feels that her friends tricked her. She calls Billy, but he cannot leave his Aquacade show. While Fanny and Nicky reminisce about old times, Fanny notes that Nicky hasn't asked about their daughter Frances, whom he hasn't seen in six years. Fanny travels to Cleveland only to find Billy in bed with Eleanor. She goes to the train station where Billy arrives to apologize. She states that her love for Nicky was gone for good while blaming herself for Billy's infidelity. She then asks him to leave her alone to wait for her train.\n\nYears pass and in the 1940s Fanny is starring in The Baby Snooks Show on radio while Billy works as a successful writer of popular songs and plays.

In the United States, it was nominated for five Academy Awards , including Best Foreign-Language Film , Best Original Screenplay (Demy), Best Original Score (Demy and Legrand), and Best Original Song for the film's main theme, \" I Will Wait for You \".

Scott Fitzgerald .\n\nWhen the project was first announced in 2021, the initial press release quoted Welch, best known as lead singer for Florence + the Machine , as saying, \"This book has haunted me for a large part of my life. It contains some of my favourite lines in literature. Musicals were my first love, and I feel a deep connection to Fitzgerald\u2019s broken romanticism.\"",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nNick Carraway, a young man from Minnesota traumatized from his time in World War I , arrives in the industrializing New York City as its working-class inhabitants sing of the labor that has gone into its development (\"Welcome to the New World\"). Nick meets the old-money Buchanans \u2013 his cousin Daisy and her husband Tom \u2013 and their friend, amateur golfer Jordan Baker. During the interaction Jordan mentions Nick's wealthy neighbor Gatsby, shocking Daisy. Tom takes a call from his mistress Myrtle Wilson to Daisy's indignation; she sings about her unhappiness beneath her perfect facade (\"Golden Girl\"). Myrtle's husband George runs an unsuccessful garage in the Valley of Ashes; the death of their child to Spanish flu years prior has driven a wedge in their relationship (\"Valley of Ashes\"). Tom takes Myrtle  to an iniquitous party in Manhattan where Myrtle feels alive, but she angers Tom by mentioning Daisy (\"Shakin Off The Dust\"). At the party, Nick sleeps with the photographer Mr. McKee, and afterwards wonders at the possibilities of the city; Daisy and Myrtle also contemplate their lots in life (\"New York Symphony\").\n\nNick receives an invitation to one of Gatsby's parties. Jordan is in attendance and enjoys the throng of people (\"One Heart Beat\"). Nick befriends the mysterious Gatsby (\"Deathless Song\"). Gatsby takes Nick to lunch, where Gatsby's business associate Meyer Wolfsheim tells Nick of Gatsby's rags-to-riches story (\"Feels Like Hell\"). Gatsby reveals that he would like to be reacquainted with Nick's cousin Daisy. Nick informs Jordan of this, admitting he is charmed by Gatsby (\"A Smile Like That Is Rare\"). In turn, Jordan tells Nick of Gatsby and Daisy's passionate affair while the former was stationed at Camp Taylor (\"Month of Love\"). Daisy did not hear from Gatsby after the latter's deployment and eventually became engaged to Tom. She received a letter from Gatsby on the morning of her wedding and attempted to call it off, but was convinced to marry Tom (\"I've Changed My Mind\"). Nick reintroduces Gatsby and Daisy at tea (\"Pouring Down\"). Despite the initial awkwardness, the two manage to reconnect after Gatsby brings Daisy and Nick to his mansion. An exhilarated Gatsby privately declares his intent to not be forgotten, and to be a man worthy of Daisy (\"Mr. Nobody from Nowhere\").\n\n### Act II\n\nGatsby invites Tom, Daisy, Nick and Jordan to another of his lavish parties (\"Just A Little Party\"). Tom is taken aback by the extravagance and confused at how Daisy and Gatsby know each other. Myrtle is also working the party and rekindles her affair with Tom. Daisy is also considering the possibility of leaving Tom for Gatsby (\"Welcome to the New World (Reprise)\"). After the party, Myrtle is frustrated by Tom's actions but intends to hold her own (\"Driving My Way\"). Daisy and Gatsby continue seeing each other, as do Tom and Myrtle (\"What Is This Worship\").\n\nGatsby pressures Daisy to reveal their relationship to Tom and divorce him. On a particularly hot day, tensions run high among Tom, Daisy, Gatsby, Nick and Jordan, and they reluctantly agree to go to a hotel suite (\"What Will We Do With Ourselves?\"). Meanwhile, George discovers Myrtle's affair and begs her to remain with him. Myrtle tries to flee but George locks her in the house (\"What Of Love, What Of God\").  Tom reveals that Gatsby is a bootlegger and a criminal, to Daisy's horror; though she readily admits that she no longer loves Tom, Gatsby demands that she say she never loved him. Daisy realizes that Gatsby's romanticization of her is akin to her family and Tom's treatment, and asserts her agency by demanding to drive Gatsby's signature Rolls-Royce back home (\"The Dream Fought On\"). Myrtle manages to escape the house and runs into the street, but is hit by the car and killed; eyewitnesses identify the Rolls-Royce. Tom is distraught by Myrtle's death and tells George Gatsby is the owner of the car. Nick is appalled at Jordan's blas\u00e9 attitude towards the accident and disavows her company.\n\nAt home, Daisy and Tom argue about the incident. Daisy angrily says that she knowingly ran Myrtle over to spite Tom; Tom assures her that they could stay married and maintain their good name, though this would mean Daisy is no different from him (\"The Damage That You Do\"). Nick tries to convince Gatsby to flee the country, but Gatsby steadfastedly waits for Daisy (\"Vigil\"). Gatsby and George separately lament how American society has molded them (\"America, She Breaks\"). George shoots Gatsby dead before committing suicide.\n\nLater, the only attendees at Gatsby's funeral are Nick, a drunken party guest, and Gatsby's father, a Native American man who remains proud of his son despite their estrangement (\"Pouring Down (Reprise)\"). Wolfsheim tells Nick that he mourned Gatsby but could not afford to remain associated with him. Lamenting their situation and resolving to do better in the future, Nick departs New York City, but not before visiting Gatsby's abandoned mansion one more time (\"We Beat On\").",

        "synopsis": "Orphaned teenager Dorothy Gale lives on a farm in Kansas with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry and dog Toto, but feels misunderstood (\"Nobody Understands Me\"). The unpleasant Miss Gulch threatens to call the sheriff after Toto bites her leg. Dorothy wants to escape to a nicer place, somewhere (\" Over the Rainbow \"). She runs away from the farm and meets Professor Marvel, who tells her all about (\"Wonders of the World\"). They are interrupted by a twister , and Dorothy runs home for shelter. Inside the farmhouse, she bangs her head on the bedside. The house is blown away by the storm.\n\nLanding in Oz, Dorothy's house flattens the Wicked Witch of the East. Glinda , the Good Witch of the North, greets Dorothy and tells her where she is. Glinda calls for the Munchkins to come out.  These little people , overjoyed at the demise of their wicked tormentor, welcome Dorothy and Toto (\"Munchkinland Sequence\"). Glinda presents Dorothy with the magic ruby slippers that belonged to the dead witch. This enrages the witch's sister, the Wicked Witch of the West . Glinda tells Dorothy that the Wizard of Oz might be able to help her return home, and how to find him. Dorothy sets off toward the Emerald City to speak to the great Oz (\"Follow the Yellow Brick Road\").\n\nOn her way, she meets the Scarecrow , who feels inadequate with a head full of only stuffing (\" If I Only Had A Brain \"). Dorothy invites him to travel with her, hoping the Wizard can help him (\"We're Off to See the Wizard\"). They soon meet the Tin Man , who is unhappy with his empty tin chest (\" If I Only Had a Heart \") and invite him to join them. The Wicked Witch of the West threatens to light the Scarecrow on fire unless Dorothy gives her the ruby slippers; Dorothy refuses. In the dark forest, they encounter a very unhappy Lion , afraid of his own tail (\" If I Only Had the Nerve \"). He too joins the group on the road to the Emerald City.\n\nEmerging into the light, the friends encounter another obstacle. The Wicked Witch has cast a spell creating a huge field of poppies that puts Dorothy and the Lion to sleep. Glinda counters with a snowfall that nullifies the poison, so the friends may continue on their journey (\"We're Outta the Woods\"). Arriving at the Emerald City, Dorothy and company persuade the gatekeeper to admit them. They are welcomed with open arms and are groomed in preparation for a meeting with the Wizard (\" The Merry Old Land of Oz \"). The Wicked Witch flies down into the city with more threats, still angry that she doesn't have the ruby slippers. The four friends and Toto go into the Wizard's chamber. The great Oz appears as a frightening, disembodied head and says he will grant the group their wishes if they do something for him first. He demands: they must bring him the broomstick of the Witch of the West (\"Bring Me the Broomstick\").\n\nIn a forest on the way to the castle of the Wicked Witch of the West, the group tries to figure out how to steal the broomstick (\"We Went to See the Wizard\"). They hide from a group of the Witch's Winkies (\"March of the Winkies\"). Meanwhile, in her castle, the Witch sends her flying monkeys to capture Dorothy and Toto and bring them to the castle (\"Red Shoes Blues\"). She imprisons Dorothy and tells her to give up the slippers within the hour or die (\"Red Shoes Blues\" (Reprise)). Dorothy wishes more than ever that she was back at home and cries (\"Over the Rainbow\" (Reprise)). The Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion consider how to rescue her from the Witch's castle (\"If We Only Had a Plan\"). They disguise themselves as Winkies and sneak into the castle (\"March of the Winkies\" (Reprise)). They find the Witch and Dorothy. When the Witch tries to attack the Scarecrow, a Winkie hands Dorothy a bucket of water, which she throws over the Witch, melting her. The Winkies are thrilled to be free of the wicked witch, and the quartet return to Emerald City with the broomstick to be greeted by a large celebration of the demise of the Witch, including the people of Emerald City, the Munchkins and the Winkies (\"Hail-Hail! The Witch Is Dead\").\n\nDorothy and her friends go to see the Wizard with the broomstick. Toto reveals that the Wizard's fearsome visage is an illusion; he is just an ordinary man. Still, he gives the Scarecrow, Tin Man and Lion tokens of the brains, heart and courage that they already had inside of them (\"You Went to See the Wizard\"). He tells Dorothy that he himself will take her to Kansas in his hot air balloon, appointing the Scarecrow as prime minister of Oz, with the Tin Man and Lion as other ministers. Just before the balloon flies off, Toto runs into the crowd, and Dorothy retrieves him, missing her ride; she is seemingly stranded in Oz (\"Farewell to Oz\"). Glinda appears to tell her that she and Toto had the power to return home all along (\"Already Home\"). After saying goodbye to her friends, Dorothy taps her heels together three times, chanting \"There's no place like home\".\n\nBack in Kansas, Aunt Em and Uncle Henry tell Dorothy that she hit her head and had been unconscious for days. Dorothy insists her adventure in Oz was real, not a dream, but she is very grateful to be home. As Aunt Em and Uncle Henry leave her alone in her bedroom to rest, a gust of wind blows open her cupboard door, revealing the ruby slippers (\"Finale\").",

        "description": "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is a 1900 children's novel written by American author L. Frank Baum . Since its first publication in 1900, it has been adapted many times by L. Frank Baum and others: for film, television, theatre, books, comics, games, and other media.\n\nBaum was responsible for many early adaptations, including the 1902 musical The Wizard of Oz ,  which was an enormous success on Broadway . The casting of comedians Fred Stone as the Scarecrow and David C. Montgomery as the Tin Woodman was especially praised. Baum featured the two characters in his second Oz book , The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904), with the hopes of turning that into a stage play as well, with Stone and Montgomery in the lead roles. When the two actors declined to participate, Baum rewrote the story as The Woggle-Bug in 1905, which was a critical and commercial failure.\n\nFollowing this, Baum was responsible for several more adaptations of the Oz series. His 1906 multimedia presentation, The Fairylogue and Radio-Plays , toured for two months. A further musical, The Tik-Tok Man of Oz , was staged in 1913. Baum also began a short-lived film company, The Oz Manufacturing Company, and released three short films, beginning with The Patchwork Girl of Oz in 1914.\n\nThe most celebrated adaptation of the Oz books is the 1939 feature-length musical starring Judy Garland , which has been hailed as the most-seen film in history. Other notable film adaptations include The Wiz (1978), Return to Oz (1985), and Oz the Great and Powerful (2013). Another acclaimed production is the 2003 Broadway and West End musical Wicked , based on the 1995 revisionist novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire . The musical itself has since been adapted into a successful two-part film .",

The plot has elements of melodrama but lacks the swashbuckling style common to Romberg's other works.",
        "synopsis": "### Prologue\n\nPrince Karl Franz is heir to the (fictitious) German kingdom of Karlsberg. He has grown up fatherless, under rather gloomy military conditions of castle life (\"By Our Bearing So Sedate\"). He has been educated by tutors, in particular, kindly Doctor Engel, who has taught him the songs of his alma mater , the venerable University of Heidelberg (\"Golden Days\"). Karl Franz has been promised in marriage, since childhood, to the Princess Margaret (Johanna in some versions), but he has never met her. His grandfather, King Ferdinand, sends him to the university incognito, to live as an ordinary student, and improve his social skills. Karl Franz sets off under the watchful eye of Doctor Engel, accompanied by his snooty valet Lutz, who has his own assistant, Hubert.\n\n### Act 1\n\nAt Heidelberg, Herr Ruder keeps the rustic Inn of Three Gold Apples (\"Garlands Bright\"). His beautiful niece Kathie waits tables in the inn's beer-garden. The inn is very popular with the students, who go there to drink and sing (\"Drink! Drink! Drink!\"). Karl Franz, the finicky Lutz and Hubert arrive for the spring term and take rooms at the Three Gold Apples, to the delight of Engel and the disgust of Lutz (\"Entrance of the Prince in Heidelberg\"). Karl falls in love, almost at first sight, with Kathie, who returns his affection (\"Deep in My Heart, Dear\"). But he is a royal heir, and she is a commoner.\n\nKarl Franz also makes friends with three students, Detlef, Lucas and von Asterberg, and shares the camaraderie of student life, with nights of enthusiastic drinking and singing. He joins their student corps (\"Finale act 1\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nAs the term passes, Karl Franz and his friends continue to enjoy student life (\"Farmer Jacob Lay-a-Snoring\", \"Students' Life\"). By the end of the term, Karl Franz and Kathie are deeply in love.\n\nBut then Karl Franz receives a surprise visit from Princess Margaret and her mother. They bring news that the king is ill and commands the prince to return home for the ceremony of betrothal to the princess. After they leave, Karl Franz and Kathie consider eloping to Paris. But Doctor Engel and Count Von Mark (the prime minister of Karlsberg) remind the prince of his duty to his kingdom. Karl Franz reluctantly agrees to obey the king's command. He promises Kathie that he will return soon (\"Finale act 2\").\n\n### Act 3\n\nBack in Karlsberg, two years pass, with Karl Franz unable to return to Heidelberg. His grandfather has died, and Karl Franz is now King. His life is bound up in court ceremony (\"Opening act 3\"). Princess Margaret has also had a secret relationship with another man, Captain Tarnitz (\"Just We Two\"). But as King, Karl Franz must honor the betrothal to Margaret (\"Gavotte\"). Margaret knows that Karl Franz has long pined for an old love, and she has heard rumors that in Heidelberg, he fell in love with a tavernkeeper's niece.\n\nWord arrives from Heidelberg that Doctor Engel has died there. Karl Franz is persuaded to visit Heidelberg for a brief reunion with his old friends, and he hopes to see Kathie again (\"What Memories/Finale act 3\").\n\n### Act 4\n\nPrincess Margaret goes to Heidelberg first, and secretly visits Kathie. Margaret persuades her that for the good of the kingdom, she must break off with Karl Franz. They agree that Kathie will tell Karl Franz she is in love with another man and is going to marry him. Karl Franz will then finally be free to accept Margaret, who has come to love him. Meanwhile, the students of Heidelberg continue their merry ways (\"Let Us Sing a Song\", \"To the Inn We're Marching, \"Overhead the Moon is Beaming \", \"Come Boys\").\n\nKarl Franz arrives, meets his old friends and visits Kathie. True to her promise, she tells him of her fictitious new love and plans to marry. Karl Franz resolves to marry Margaret without further delay, but Kathie will always be his true love (\"Deep in My Heart Dear (reprise)\").",

After stealing a loaf of bread for his sister's starving child, Valjean is imprisoned for 19 years and released in 1815. When a bishop inspires him with a tremendous act of mercy, Valjean breaks his parole and starts his life anew and in disguise. He becomes wealthy and adopts an orphan, Cosette.

The characters are swept into a revolutionary period in France, where a group of young idealists attempts to overthrow the government at a street barricade in Paris.\n\nThe French musical premiered in Paris in 1980 with direction by Robert Hossein . Its English-language adaptation, with lyrics by Herbert Kretzmer , produced by Cameron Mackintosh and directed by Trevor Nunn and John Caird , has been running in London since October 1985, making it the longest-running musical in the West End and the second longest-running musical in the world after the original off-Broadway run of The Fantasticks .

Marked by his yellow ticket of leave (\"On Parole\"), Valjean is shunned and cannot find decent work until the Bishop of Digne offers him shelter. Valjean steals the Bishop's silver, but the Bishop pretends to have given it to him and also gives him a pair of silver candlesticks (\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"). Valjean vows to start an honest life (\"Valjean's Soliloquy (What Have I Done?)\"). He tears up his ticket, breaking parole.\n\n### Act I\n\nBy 1823, Valjean is living disguised as Monsieur Madeleine, a factory owner and the mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer . Fantine , a single mother working at Valjean's factory, is fired after a disagreement with the lustful foreman and sinks into poverty (\"At the End of the Day\"; \" I Dreamed a Dream \"), selling her locket and hair, and becoming a prostitute (\"Lovely Ladies\"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Javert, now a police inspector, arrests her. Valjean intervenes and takes her to a hospital (\"Fantine's Arrest\").\n\nWhen Valjean rescues a man pinned by a runaway cart, Javert, who has pursued him over the years, suspects his true identity. Learning an innocent man is about to be jailed in his place, Valjean confesses (\"Who Am I?\"). At the hospital, Fantine dies after Valjean promises to rescue her daughter Cosette from the thieving Th\u00e9nardiers , innkeepers who are paid to raise her (\"Fantine's Death (Come to Me)\"). Valjean escapes Javert (\"The Confrontation\"). In Montfermeil , the Th\u00e9nardiers use Cosette as a servant, treating her cruelly, while extorting money from Fantine (\"Castle on a Cloud\"; \"Master of the House\"). Valjean pays them 1,500 francs to release Cosette (\"The Bargain\") and takes her to Paris (\"The Waltz of Treachery\").\n\nIn 1832 Paris, unrest grows with the impending death of the merciful General Lamarque . Student revolutionaries Marius Pontmercy and Enjolras prepare for an uprising. The Th\u00e9nardiers, who have lost their inn and now lead a gang of street criminals, plot scams. Their daughter \u00c9ponine befriends the streetwise urchin Gavroche (\"Look Down\"). She secretly loves Marius, but he falls instantly for Cosette when he meets her with Valjean, whom the Th\u00e9nardiers attempt to rob (\"The Robbery\"). Valjean is recognized, but he and Cosette escape; Javert vows to recapture him (\"Stars\"). Marius persuades \u00c9ponine to help him find Cosette (\"\u00c9ponine\u2019s Errand\").\n\nAs Enjolras rallies the students (\"The ABC Caf\u00e9/Red and Black\"), Marius pines for Cosette. News of Lamarque\u2019s death sparks plans for revolution (\" Do You Hear the People Sing? \"). Cosette confronts Valjean about his secrets (\"In My Life\"). \u00c9ponine finds Cosette, and Marius and Cosette confess their love (\"A Heart Full of Love\"). Th\u00e9nardier and his gang arrive to rob Valjean's house but are foiled by \u00c9ponine\u2019s warning (\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\"). Believing Javert has found him, Valjean plans to flee with Cosette. On the eve of the 1832 Paris Uprising , Enjolras exhorts all of Paris to join the revolution. \u00c9ponine acknowledges in anguish that Marius will never love her. Javert plans to spy on, while the students and rebels steel themselves for battle (\" One Day More \").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe students build a barricade; Marius discovers that \u00c9ponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels (\"Building the Barricade\"). To keep her safe, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette (\" On My Own \"). Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. The French army arrives, demanding surrender (\"At the Barricade\"). Javert, disguised as a rebel, is exposed as a spy by young Gavroche (\"Little People\"). Wounded during the fighting, \u00c9ponine dies in Marius\u2019s arms, confessing her love (\"A Little Fall of Rain (Eponine's Death)\").\n\nValjean arrives disguised as a soldier, hoping to protect Marius (\"Night of Anguish\"). He saves Enjolras from a soldier. Valjean releases Javert instead of executing him, shaking Javert\u2019s rigid view of God and justice (\"The First Attack\"). As dawn approaches, the students prepare for attack (\"Drink with Me\"). Valjean prays for Marius's safety, offering God his own life (\"Bring Him Home\"). Enjolras realizes the people of Paris have not risen up but resolves to fight on (\"Dawn of Anguish\"). The army attacks; Gavroche is killed (\"The Second Attack (Death of Gavroche)\"), and all the students but Marius die. Valjean carries a gravely wounded Marius through the sewers and collapses (\"The Final Battle\"). Th\u00e9nardier, looting bodies, comes upon the unconscious Valjean and Marius, taking a ring from the latter and fleeing (\"Dog Eats Dog\"). At the sewer's exit, Valjean finds Javert waiting; he begs Javert for time to bring Marius to a doctor. Javert, unable to reconcile Valjean\u2019s mercy with his worldview, kills himself (\"Javert\u2019s Suicide\").\n\nParis mourns the fallen students (\"Turning\"). Marius grieves his friends and wonders who saved him (\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\"). Valjean blesses Marius and Cosette\u2019s marriage (\"Every Day\") but tells Marius he is an escaped convict and must leave to protect Cosette (\"Valjean\u2019s Confession\"). At their wedding (\"Wedding Chorale\"), the Th\u00e9nardiers attempt to blackmail Marius, who realizes Valjean carried him from the barricades (\"Beggars at the Feast\"). Marius and Cosette rush to find Valjean.\n\n### Epilogue\n\nAt a convent, Valjean awaits death. Fantine\u2019s spirit assures him of forgiveness. Cosette and Marius arrive in time to bid farewell. Valjean thanks God for seeing Cosette grown and happy (\"Valjean\u2019s Death\"). He entrusts her with his past and tells her the truth about her mother. Guided by the spirits of Fantine and \u00c9ponine, who remind him that \"to love another person is to see the face of God\", he dies at peace, joining the souls of the fallen in a hopeful vision of freedom (\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" (reprise)\").",

        "description": "Much Ado , Bernard J. Taylor 's musical version of Shakespeare 's Much Ado About Nothing , was recorded as a concept album in 1995, featuring Paul McGann , Peter Karrie and other West End stars.  It received its world premiere at Stratford-on-Avon in 1996. It was partly inspired by the Kenneth Branagh film version.  The most recent production was in Budapest , Hungary , opening in June 2007.\n\nTerry Wardrope, critic for the European musicals magazine Words and Music , wrote: \"The usual fine cast once again give full throat to a grand selection of songs. One of the strongest facets of Mr Taylor's musical talents I have found is his ability to write music in the style befitting the age his work is set, as MUCH ADO so admirably demonstrates. Paul McGann's singing voice adds style. and panache to his solo numbers (If I Could Write A Sonnet and The Strange Affliction Called Love) as well as a pleasing accompaniment to the redoubtable Claire Moore In Disdain\" and Then Kill For Me. Of course, as always Claire Moore gives a breathtaking performance with (among others) I'll Never Marry and How Can This Be, but then that lady can do no wrong in my book. It's another impressive piece from Bernard Taylor, reinforcing my impression that he is one of the finest British musical talents we have.\"\n\nMike Gibb, editor of Masquerade , the British musicals review magazine, wrote: \"It proves to be yet another fine slab of musical writing, full of invention and, as with all BJT offerings, dripping with melody. It also succeeds in capturing the mood of the period courtesy of a medieval English feel amongst the diverse musical influences. Paul McGann and Simon Burke must have been delighted with the quality of the material they were offered with the likes of I'll Never Love Again and If I Could Write A Sonnet - both grade 'A' Taylor ballads - gentle, flowing, melodious.\"",

The music has been lost; it may or may not have been written by Kay Swift. New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson called it \"the most stunning dance number [with the Tommy Atkins Sextet] attired in costumes of original color schemes, against quiet and expansive backgrounds\".

        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nCarroll \"Toddy\" Todd is tenuously employed as the resident performer at Henri Labisse's Left Bank gay club, Chez Lui. Toddy and Les Boys entertain the small but appreciative audience ( Paris By Night ). Toddy insults a group of customers which includes his ex-boyfriend Richard. Labisse threatens to fire him. A penniless English soprano, Victoria Grant, auditions unsuccessfully for Labisse. Toddy tries to help, but Labisse rejects her and fires him. Toddy befriends Victoria, and offers her shelter from the wet wintry night in his tiny apartment. They become instant buddies and confidantes. Toddy wishes he were a woman, like Victoria, while Victoria believes that there are far more advantages to being a man ( If I Were a Man ).\n\nRichard, the ex-boyfriend, arrives at Toddy's unexpectedly to collect his things. Victoria is by now wearing his hat and pajamas. Richard mistakenly thinks she is Toddy's new boyfriend and insults Toddy. Victoria punches Richard and kicks him out. Seeing that Richard believed Victoria to be a man, Toddy is struck by inspiration: Victoria could gain fame by disguising herself as a male female impersonator. Over Victoria's objections, he dreams up the persona of Count Victor Grazinsky \u2013 a gay Polish aristocrat and Toddy's new lover ( Trust Me ). Toddy drags the reluctant Victoria to meet Andre Cassell, Paris's leading impresario, who is dubious about \"Count Victor Grazinsky\" until he hears \"him\" hit a glass-shattering high G-flat. \"Victor\" is in business.\n\nLe Jazz Hot! introduces Victor to Paris caf\u00e9 society. His show-stopping performance at once makes him the toast of Gay Paree. The only doubter of Victor's authenticity is a dashing American nightclub owner, King Marchan, visiting Paris with his brassy girlfriend Norma and his loyal bodyguard Squash. Norma mocks King for being attracted to a male impersonator, but King is determined to prove Victor is a woman. At Cassell's opening night party for Victor, King invites Victor to tango with Norma, hoping to prove his point ( The Tango ), but Victoria successfully avoids detection.\n\nBy an unwelcome coincidence, King and Norma and Squash find themselves in the adjoining hotel suite to the newly successful Toddy and Victor. Norma tries to seduce King ( Paris Makes Me Horny ) but she succeeds only in making him impotent. Next door, Victoria bemoans to Toddy that in King she thinks she has finally found the man of her dreams, but here she is trying to convince him that she is a man, too. ( Crazy World ).\n\n### Act 2\n\nVictor continues to take Paris audiences by storm ( Louis Says ). Norma complains to Victor and Toddy that King is shipping her back to Chicago because he fancies Victor. King confronts his doubts about himself and Victor ( King's Dilemma ). He invites Victor and Toddy to dinner to try and find out. After dinner they visit Chez Lui, where Labisse also has his suspicions that Victor is a woman. He invites her/him to sing. Victor and Toddy oblige ( You and Me ). Richard's group arrives noisily in mid-song. Victor trips Richard and starts a major brawl in the club. The police arrive to break it up. Outside the club, King says he doesn't care if Victor is a man, and kisses him. Victoria admits she's not a man. King says he still doesn't care, and kisses her again ( Paris By Night (Reprise) ).\n\nBack in the hotel, Squash barges into King's bedroom and finds King and Victor in bed together: He apologizes profusely. King tries to explain. Squash admires King for coming out of the closet, and stuns his boss by revealing that he, too, is gay. Victor and King examine their potential problems if they are perceived publicly as two men. It won't work. ( Almost a Love Song ).\n\nBack in Chicago, Norma is performing in a night club ( Chicago, Illinois ). She informs King's gangster partner, Sal Andretti, that King has dumped her for another man \u2013 and is living with \"a gay Polish fairy.\" Sal is aghast, and says they're all going to Europe. Two weeks later, Toddy and Squash have become happy partners. Not so for King and Victoria, unable to be seen together in public ( Living in the Shadows ). Victoria tells Toddy she doesn't want to be a man anymore. Toddy understands. Neither does he. Sal and the spurned Norma arrive in Paris. King admits he loves \"Victor\", keeping the secret. Sal, disgusted, ends their business relationship. Victoria reveals herself to Norma as a woman. Norma is horrified. Labisse witnesses this moment of naked truth. Victoria is horrified. Toddy tells her not to worry. \"Trust me!\" Dissolve to Victor's farewell appearance ( Victor/Victoria ). Labisse tries to expose him/her as a fraud. Toddy, thrilled to be back in drag, replaces Victoria in a blink, to thwart Labisse and leave the way clear for a happy ending for our two loving couples -King and Victoria, and Toddy and Squash.",

The attack starts with a music-proof glass globe that imprisons the band. The Blue Meanies fire projectiles and drop apples (a reference to the Beatles' then-new company Apple Corps ) that render Pepperland's residents immobile as statues, and drain the entire countryside of colour.\n\nIn the last minutes before his capture, Pepperland's elderly Lord High Mayor sends Young Fred to get help. The Apple Bonkers \"bonk\" the Mayor with several large apples as Fred takes off in the Yellow Submarine (\" Yellow Submarine \"). He travels to Liverpool (\" Eleanor Rigby \"), where he follows a depressed Ringo to \"The Pier\", a building on the top of a hill, and persuades him to return to Pepperland with him. Ringo collects his mates John , George , and Paul . The four decide to help Young Fred, and journey with him back to Pepperland in the submarine (\" All Together Now \"). They pass the Sea of Time (\" When I'm Sixty-Four \"), the Sea of Science (\" Only A Northern Song \"), and the Sea of Monsters, where Ringo presses the forbidden panic button, and gets swept out of the submarine. John, Paul and George manage to save Ringo with a rescue button, bringing him back before a vacuum creature sucks away the whole Sea of Monsters and itself, leaving the group in Sea of Nothing. Crash landing, they meet Jeremy Hillary Boob Ph.D., a short and studious creature (\" Nowhere Man \"). The Boob repairs the submarine's tiny motor, and Ringo invites him to join them. They arrive at the Foothills of the Headlands (\" Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds \"), where they are accidentally separated from the submarine and Fred. They then find themselves in the Sea of Holes, where Jeremy is kidnapped by a Blue Meanie, and Ringo picks up the hole that Jeremy was previously stuck in and puts it in his pocket. Then when he steps on a green hole, it turns into the Sea of Green, which brings the group to Pepperland.\n\nReuniting with Young Fred and reviving the apple-bonked Lord Mayor, they look upon Pepperland's now-miserable, grey landscape. The Beatles dress up as Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, steal some instruments, and rally the land to rebellion (\" Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band \" and \" With A Little Help From My Friends \"). The Chief Blue Meanie retaliates by sending out the Dreadful Flying Glove, which John defeats (\" All You Need Is Love \"). Pepperland is restored to colour as its residents revive and flowers re-bloom. Ringo uses the hole in his pocket to release the Lonely Hearts Club Band, and they join the Beatles in combating the Meanies' multi-headed dog (\" Hey Bulldog \"). Ringo then rescues Jeremy, who performs some \"transformation magic\" on the Chief Blue Meanie, causing the Meanie to bloom roses and sadly concede defeat. John extends an offer of friendship, and the Chief Blue Meanie has a change of heart and accepts, confessing that he is related to the Bluebird of Happiness . The Beatles, the Blue Meanies and the Pepperlandians then celebrate their new peace and love (\" It's All Too Much \").\n\nThe film ends with a segment featuring the real Beatles, who playfully show their souvenirs from their journey: George has the submarine's motor, Paul has \"a little 'love',\" and Ringo has \"half a hole\" in his pocket (having apparently given the other half to Jeremy, though Paul recommends to \" fix it to keep his mind from wondering \"). John, looking through a telescope, tells the group, and the audience, that \"newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre\" and that everyone will need to sing to ensure the audience escapes.

A theatre spokeswoman issued an apology and said that subsequent performances would not contain the word. A 2017 prompt book for a production of Shrek Jr. , a shortened version of the show for children's theater, contains a revised lyric which removes the slur. However, in 2018, when several students in Maryland went on a field trip to a performance of the full musical at a local high school, they complained that the slur appeared in the song. A subsequent controversy emerged when a parent who also complained about the slur was fired from her job at the Maryland State Education Association, with the organization saying that her statements represented a conflict of interest.",

        "description": "Hoy no me puedo levantar ( Today I Can't Get up ) is a Spanish jukebox musical , with music and lyrics by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Cano and Nacho Cano , former members of the band Mecano . Based on 32 of the band's greatest hits and named after their first single , the musical centers on a pair of impoverished musicians trying to be part of La Movida Madrile\u00f1a , after the fall of Francisco Franco 's dictatorship. Through an analysis of the 1980s, the musical portrays the condition of these boys trying to survive in Madrid , under the shadow of drugs and AIDS . The musical ran for four seasons in Madrid 's Rialto Theatre (former Movistar Theatre ) and for three seasons in Mexico City's Centro Cultural Telmex and Teatro Aldama. It was produced by Drive in Spain and OCESA Teatro in Mexico.",
        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nThe play is set on Madrid in 1981 and revolves around Mario, a guy from a small town who wants to move to the city following the dream of creating his own band (\"Hoy no me puedo levantar\"). He and his best friend, Colate, are prepared to move out, but Colate's girlfriend, Ana, doesn't want him to leave. After Mario promises that he will take care of Colate, she finally agrees and they set off to Madrid (\"Quiero vivir en la ciudad\"). I\n\nIn Madrid, they go to many bars but are not allowed to play at any. They arrive at El 33 , where they get jobs as waiters in order to earn the money that they badly need to survive and buy instruments. They find out that there will be a band contest, and the winner will be able to record an album. Afterwards, they go to another bar to find more members for their band; there they meet Panchi and Guillermo (\"Hoy no me puedo levantar (reprise)\"/\"No hay marcha en Nueva York\").\n\nBack in El 33 , Guillermo tries to create a new look for the band with the help of some gay stylists (\"Maquillaje\") and Mario meets a girl named Maria, whom he falls in love with. Later he confesses his love, but she is not interested in him (\"Por la cara\"). Guillermo introduces them to Patricia and, thanks to Panchi, they discover drugs and start smoking marijuana (\"Hawaii-Bombay\"). Panchi introduces Colate to Churchi, a very popular drug dealer in Madrid, and they start using cocaine . Ana goes to Madrid to visit Colate but is disappointed when she finds him drugged, with many people sleeping in the same room, and decides to leave (\"Qu\u00e9date en Madrid\").\n\nAnselmo, the owner of El 33 , teaches Mario buler\u00edas to conquer Maria (\"Una Rosa es Una Rosa\") but she still refuses. Maria tells Patricia about the infidelities of men and proposes they become lesbians , but later says this was a joke (\"Mujer contra Mujer\"). After Panchi interrupts the scene, Maria is troubled because she thinks Mario is just going to hurt her (\"L\u00eda\").\n\nColate spends all the money they have been saving to buy their instruments on drugs, and he tells the band members it was stolen from him. Anselmo decides to pay for the instruments and be the manager of the band, so they change their name from Luna to Rul\u00e9 (\"Me col\u00e9 en una fiesta\"). Rul\u00e9 gets to the final of the contest and they win (\"No controles\"). Afterwards the band members celebrate. At the party, Churchi gives Colate a bag with heroin as a gift for his success. Mario and Maria have a fight, but in the end Maria gives in and they start going out (\"Medley 1\").\n\n### Act Two\n\nSome years have passed, and Rul\u00e9's album has been a big hit. While Colate and Panchi smoke marijuana on the roof of El 33 they fantasize about Dal\u00ed and Laika (\"'Eungenio' Salvador Dal\u00ed/Laika\"). Afterwards, Anselmo, Mario and Guillermo find them and tell them they are going to produce the theme of a TV show (\"Aire\"). Colate goes back to his apartment and has a drug overdose (\"Perdido en mi habitaci\u00f3n\").\n\nSome months later they all get together in El 33 to celebrate that their single \"Aire\" is a number one hit. Maria doesn't stay long because she has to work the next day and leaves, but she forgets her purse. When she returns she finds Mario making out with another girl, gets mad, and leaves. Mario writes a song for her, but Maria is offended by the song and they break up (\"Cruz de Navajas\").\n\nMario goes to find Colate, but he is not at his apartment. When he is about to leave, Colate walks in with a bag of heroin in his hand. Mario tries to convince him to stop using drugs, and the two get into a fight (\"Barco a Venus\"). Mario decides to become a solo artist and leaves the band (\"El uno, el dos y el tres\").\n\nFour years after the band won the contest, Maria shows up in El 33 looking for Mario, but he is not there. She and Anselmo talk about Mario's career and are depressed (\"El 7 de septiembre\"). When Maria is leaving, Mario walks in and spend the night together (\" Hijo de la Luna \").\n\nOn New Year's Eve of 1987, Maria, Anselmo, Colate, Panchi and Guillermo get together to celebrate (\"Un a\u00f1o mas\"). Colate is very skinny and weak and leaves the party early. Colate goes to find Mario in his new apartment, but Mario refuses to talk to him and throws him out. The audience learns that Colate has AIDS and he wanted to say goodbye to Mario. Colate phones Ana, who is now pregnant and married, and says goodbye; afterwards Colate hangs himself in his apartment (\"El fallo positivo\"). Panchi finds Colate's body and cries. Mario hears the news from Colate and feels very guilty and lonely (\"Me cuesta tanto olvidarte\").\n\nMario goes to the cemetery , where he finds all his old friends. After they leave, Mario stays behind and Colate's ghost appears to him (\"No es serio este cementerio\"). He tells Mario to go back to Madrid and form the band with Anselmo, instead of him, and get Maria back. Mario does this and goes back to El 33 to meet Maria (\"La fuerza del destino\" / \"Vivimos siempre juntos\" / Medley 2).",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn June 1992, the cast members are preparing for rehearsals for Jackson's upcoming Dangerous World Tour; the first show in Munich , Germany is in two days. Rob, their manager, tells them to get into their places and warm up. Jackson arrives and watches the process, which leads to the opening number (\" Beat It \").\n\nAs Jackson shares his newest ideas with Rob, Rachel arrives with her cameraman, Alejandro, in hopes of getting an interview with Jackson. He sits with Rachel and recounts some of the terrors he suffered as a child and some of the memorable times when Berry Gordy played his family's hits on his Motown label. Jackson also discusses his collaboration with Quincy Jones and recording his albums Off the Wall , Thriller and Bad with Jones.\n\nRob and Nick escort Jackson to the press conference at Radio City Music Hall , where he presents his tour and hopes to raise $100 million for the Heal the World Foundation by Christmas 1993 (\" Earth Song \" / \" They Don\u2019t Care About Us \").\n\n### Act II\n\nJackson proposes new ideas for the tour (\" Billie Jean \"/\" Smooth Criminal \"), which Rob and Dave tell him are impractical and that they cannot afford it. Jackson recounts the horrific accident in 1984 when a spark ignited his hair in the making of an advertisement for Pepsi . After listening to Rob's negative feedback, Jackson reminds him of something Quincy said to him, \"Keep the faith. Don't let nobody take you down\".\n\nAs the rehearsal continues, Jackson tells Rachel how the songs open up to him. During a break, a commotion breaks out. Rob tries to keep Rachel away from Jackson and doesn't want her near him, but Jackson manages to find her by disguising himself as a cleaner. He explains to her that the disguise is the only way he can be seen in public, which leads to him singing \" Human Nature \". After the rehearsal, Jackson explains to Rachel how emotional he feels about being loved by fans and about being teased in the newspapers. He tries to blame everything sad and unusual about himself on others (especially the press) but takes sole credit for his good deeds and success.\n\nAs Rob comes to check up on him, Jackson recalls when he played at the Apollo Theater with the Jackson 5 and how he wasn't nervous. Rob tells Jackson that everything they created would be remembered for decades, but the latter replies by asking \"Is it perfect?\" (\" Man in the Mirror \"). Jackson appears on stage, prepared to start the first show of the Dangerous Tour, (\" Jam (Reprise)\", \" Black or White \" / \" Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' (Reprise)\".",

        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nThe setting is Sweden , around the turn of the 20th century. One by one, the Quintet \u2013 five singers who comment like a Greek chorus throughout the show \u2013 enter, tuning up. Gradually, their vocalizing becomes an overture blending fragments of \"Remember,\" \"Soon,\" and \"The Glamorous Life.\" The other characters enter waltzing , each uncomfortable with their partner (\"Night Waltz\"). After they drift back off, the aging and sardonic Madame Armfeldt, a wealthy former courtesan , and her solemn granddaughter, Fredrika, enter. Madame Armfeldt tells the child that the summer night \"smiles\" three times: first on the young, second on fools, and third on the old. Fredrika vows to watch the smiles occur.\n\nMiddle-aged, successful lawyer Fredrik Egerman has recently married an 18-year-old trophy wife , Anne, a naive girl who loves Fredrik but is not attracted to him. The two have been married for eleven months, and Anne still protects her virginity . Upon coming home from work, Fredrik surprises Anne with tickets to a play, starring Desiree Armfeldt, a glamorous actress whom Anne greatly admires. Anne giddily fantasizes about what it would be like to be as beautiful and beloved as Desiree, and starts talking at Fredrik about her day. Fredrik, distracted by his lust, considers various ways he might seduce his wife but ultimately rules each one out and elects to take a nap instead (\"Now\"). Meanwhile, his son Henrik, a seminary student a year older than his stepmother, is frustrated and ignored (\"Later\"). Anne promises her husband that shortly she will consent to have sex even though she can't help recoiling at his touch (\"Soon\"), and all three of them lament at once. The number concludes with Fredrik sighing Desiree's name in his sleep, which Anne overhears. Anne's maidservant Petra, an experienced and forthright girl, slightly older than the teen herself, offers her worldly but crass advice.\n\nDesiree Armfeldt, although once prominent, is now a fading flower clinging onto what's left of her past fame. Desiree tours in small, obscure towns with her theatre troupe. Madam Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, has taken over the care of Desiree's daughter Fredrika. Fredrika misses her mother, but Desiree continually delays seeing her, preferring, somewhat ironically, her life on tour (\"The Glamorous Life\"). As Fredrik and Anne take their seats at Desiree's play, Anne's previous excitement quickly devolves into anxiety, suspicious that Fredrik and Desiree have a romantic history that he never disclosed to her. The play begins and Desiree immediately notices Fredrik in the audience, and the Quintet reveals their shared memories and passionate relationship (\"Remember\"). Desiree, ironically playing a sexually irresistible countess, exchanges amorous glances with Fredrik and delivers her lines in an overtly suggestive tone, confirming Anne's suspicions as true. Anne, upset and overwhelmed, demands that Fredrik take her home. Meanwhile, Petra tries to seduce a nervous and petulant Henrik.\n\nThat night, as Fredrik remembers his past with Desiree, he sneaks out to see her. The two have a happy but strained reunion, reflecting on their new lives. Desiree sarcastically boasts of her own adultery, as she has been seeing the married dragoon , Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. Following, Fredrik tries to explain how much he loves Anne, fending off Desiree's interjecting quips, but he ultimately reveals his sexual frustration (\"You Must Meet My Wife\"). Upon learning that Fredrik has gone for eleven months without sex, she agrees to accommodate him as a favor for an old friend.\n\nMadam Armfeldt offers advice to young Fredrika. The elderly woman reflects poignantly on her own checkered past and wonders what happened to prior refined styles of living (\"Liaisons\"). In Desiree's apartment, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm proclaims his unannounced arrival in his usual booming tones. Fredrik and Desiree fool the Count with an innocent explanation for their disheveled appearance, but he is still suspicious. He boasts of his many duels and the various wounds he has suffered before demonstrating his skills in knife-throwing. Fredrik responds sarcastically, causing the dragoon to dislike him immediately. Carl-Magnus returns to his wife, Countess Charlotte. Charlotte knows of her husband's infidelity, but Carl-Magnus is too absorbed in his suspicions of Desiree to talk to her (\"In Praise of Women\"). When she persuades him to blurt out the whole story, a twist is revealed\u2014Charlotte's little sister is a schoolfriend of Anne's.\n\nCharlotte visits Anne and describes Fredrik's tryst with Desiree. Anne is shocked and saddened, but Charlotte explains that such is the lot of a wife, and love brings pain (\"Every Day a Little Death\"). Meanwhile, Desiree asks Madam Armfeldt to host a party for Fredrik, Anne, and Henrik. Madam Armfeldt reluctantly agrees and sends out a personal invitation; its receipt sends Anne into a frenzy, imagining Desiree further seducing Fredrik at the estate. Anne does not want to accept the invitation, but Charlotte convinces her to do so to heighten the contrast between the older Desiree and the young and beautiful teenager. Charlotte relates this to the Count, who (much to her chagrin) decides to visit the Armfeldts, uninvited, as well. Carl-Magnus plans to challenge Fredrik to a duel , while Charlotte hopes to seduce the lawyer to make her husband jealous and end his philandering. The act ends as all characters head to Madam Armfeldt's estate (\"A Weekend in the Country\").\n\n### Act Two\n\nMadam Armfeldt's country estate is bathed in the golden glow of perpetual summer sunset at this high latitude (\"Night Waltz One and Two\"). Everyone arrives, each with their own amorous purposes and desires\u2014even Petra, who catches the eye of Armfeldt's fetching manservant , Frid. The women begin to quarrel with one another. Fredrik is astonished to learn the name of Desiree's daughter. Henrik meets Fredrika, and confesses to her he deeply loves Anne. Meanwhile, in the garden, Fredrik and Carl-Magnus reflect on the difficulty of being annoyed with Desiree, contrasting her immoral actions with her physical beauty (\"It Would Have Been Wonderful\"). Dinner is served, and the female Quintet singers comment on the characters\u2019 suspense regarding the coming meal (\"Perpetual Anticipation\").\n\nAt dinner, Charlotte attempts to flirt with Fredrik and trades insults with Desiree. Soon, everyone is shouting and scolding everyone else, except for Henrik, who finally speaks up. He accuses the whole company of being amoral , and flees the scene. Stunned, everyone reflects on the situation and wanders away. Fredrika tells Anne of Henrik's secret love and the two dash off searching for him. Meanwhile, Desiree meets Fredrik and asks if he still wants to be \"rescued\" from his life. Fredrik answers honestly that he loves Desiree but cannot bring himself to hurt Anne. Regretful and hurt, Desiree can only reflect on the nature of her life and relationship with Fredrik (\" Send In the Clowns \"). Anne finds Henrik, who is attempting to commit suicide. The clumsy boy cannot complete the task, and Anne tells him she loves him, too. The pair begins to kiss, which leads to Anne's first sexual encounter. Meanwhile, not far away, Frid sleeps in Petra's lap. The maid imagines advantageous marriages but concludes that in the meantime, \"a girl ought to celebrate what passes by\" (\"The Miller's Son\"). Charlotte confesses her plan to Fredrik, and both watch Henrik and Anne, happy together, run away to start their new life. The two commiserate on a bench. Carl-Magnus, preparing to sleep with Desiree, sees this and jealously challenges Fredrik to Russian Roulette ; Fredrik nervously misfires and merely grazes his own ear. Feeling victorious, Carl-Magnus reaffirms his love for Charlotte, finally granting her wish.\n\nAfter the Count and Countess leave, Fredrika and Madam Armfeldt discuss the recent chaotic turns of events. The elderly woman asks Fredrika a surprising question: \"What is it all for?\" Fredrika thinks about this and decides that love, for all of its frustrations, \"must be worth it.\" Madam Armfeldt is surprised, ruefully noting that she rejected love for material wealth at Fredrika's age. She praises her granddaughter and remembers true love's fleeting nature.\n\nFredrik finally confesses his love for Desiree, acknowledging that Fredrika is his daughter, and the two promise to start a new life together (\"Send in the Clowns\" (Reprise)). Madam Armfeldt sits alone with Fredrika, who tells her grandmother that she has watched carefully but still has not seen the night smile. Madam Armfeldt laughs and points out that the night has indeed smiled twice: first on Henrik and Anne, the young, and second on Desiree and Fredrik, the fools. As the two wait for the \"third smile... on the old\", it occurs: Madam Armfeldt closes her eyes and dies peacefully with Fredrika beside her (\"Last Waltz\").",

After their night on the town, Bibi begs Jacques to \"Please Stay\".\n\nWhen Bibi takes Grandpere's \"naughty\" pictures to school and is discovered, his stern father Philippe forces him to apologize to his school-mates. Bibi is embarrassed and upset and tries to cajole Jacques into taking him away when he leaves. Although Jacques at first agrees, thinking that Bibi will be a companion, he quickly realizes that this would not be good for Bibi.\n\nMeanwhile, Jacques finds it difficult to commit to his former sweetheart Laurie (\"I Don't Remember You\").  The couple finally realize that they have opposite ideas about life and the future (\"Seeing Things\"), with Laurie understanding that Jacques is emotionally a boy, like her students. Grandpere, Jacques and Bibi playfully sing an ode to \"A Certain Girl\".

        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\n3,300 years ago, under the reign of Egyptian Pharaoh Seti I , the Hebrews were an enslaved race, forced to work mercilessly to meet the demands of Seti's growing empire. Since the increasing population of the Hebrews threatened the Egyptians, the pharaoh handed down an edict sentencing all newborn Hebrew sons to death. The baby Moses , born of Jochebed and Amram , was set adrift on the Nile in a basket, so that his life might be saved. He was found by the daughter of Seti, the childless Princess Bithia , who believed Moses was sent to her by the gods.\n\nMoses was adopted by Seti and raised in the pharaoh's court as a brother to the young prince, Ramses . When the brothers grew to young men, Seti announced that Ramses would become the next pharaoh. Moses would be his second in command , the architect of his cities, and his lifetime chief counselor. Both brothers fervently wished to marry the young princess, Nefertari . Ramses' position as pharaoh forced Nefertari to take him and give up her secret hope of being with Moses, the only man she ever loved.\n\nAs time passed, Moses began to question the enslavement of the Hebrews. After witnessing an Egyptian guard abusing a Hebrew, Moses became enraged at the injustices the slaves were suffering, and impulsively killed the guard. During his murder trial, Moses' real sister Miriam revealed to Moses that he was actually the son of Jochebed, a Hebrew slave. Moses was banished to the desert and fled to Midian, where he met and married Zipporah , the daughter of the Midianite priest .\n\nOne day in the wilderness, Moses saw a bush that was burning but was not consumed by the flames . From it came the voice of God , instructing him to return to Egypt and demand that Ramses free the Hebrew slaves. Moses, armed only with his shepherd's staff but inspired by the power of God, undertook the mission to lead the Hebrews to \"a promised land , a land overflowing with milk and honey\". Moses returned to Egypt to confront the pharaoh.\n\nBack in Egypt, the brutality of Ramses' treatment of the slaves only strengthened Moses' resolve. Ramses was overjoyed at the return of his brother until Moses told him that he must let the Hebrews go, explaining to him that no man has the right to enslave another man. Enraged by Moses' plea, Ramses threatened to kill the slaves. In response, Moses unleashed ten plagues on the Kingdom of the Pharaoh; the last one resulted in the death of Ramses\u2019 own son . Devastated, Ramses finally freed the slaves.\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe Hebrews hastily began their trek into the desert, where they wandered, fed by manna and guided by pillars of smoke and fire . Driven by vengeance and Nefertari's goading, Ramses sent his armies to overtake the escaped slaves. The Hebrews, trapped on high cliffs overlooking the Red Sea , began to panic, but Moses urged them to have faith. As he raised his staff, the sea parted , opening a pathway for their escape. The Egyptian soldiers tried to follow, but the sea closed, drowning them.\n\nWandering in the desert, the Hebrews became discontented and afraid. Moses left the group at the base of Mt. Sinai while he ascended to the peak to seek God's help. There he received The Ten Commandments , a basic law of human conduct. He brought the commandments back to his people, only to find that they had descended into idolatry and sin . Enraged and disappointed, he broke the law tablets and threatened that God would punish the Hebrews. The people repented, accepted the new law, and thus prepared to enter The Promised Land.",

        "title": "Rebecca (musical)",
        "description": "Rebecca is a musical adaptation of the 1938 novel of the same name by Daphne du Maurier . It was composed by Sylvester Levay with German book and lyrics by Michael Kunze . The plot, which adheres closely to the original novel, revolves around wealthy Maxim DeWinter, his na\u00efve new wife, called \"I\" (\"Ich\" in the German version), and Mrs. Danvers, the manipulative housekeeper of DeWinter's Cornish estate Manderley. Mrs. Danvers resents the new wife's intrusion and persuades her that she is an unworthy replacement for DeWinter's first wife, the glamorous and mysterious Rebecca, who perished in a drowning accident. The new Mrs. DeWinter struggles to find her identity and take control of her life among the shadows left by Rebecca.\n\nThe musical premiered on 28 September 2006 at the Raimund Theater in Vienna , Austria, where it ran for three years. Subsequent productions have been mounted in Finland, Korea, Japan and elsewhere in Europe. The first English-language production, in a translation by Christopher Hampton and Kunze, began on 4 September and ended on 18 November 2023 at the Charing Cross Theatre in London.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nA young English woman, \"I\", dreams of her husband's family manor, Manderley, a burned ruin (\"Ich hab getr\u00e4umt von Manderley\"). She reflects on the events that set Manderley's ruin into motion. In a hotel in Monte Carlo years earlier, in April 1926, she is employed as a traveling companion by a wealthy American, Mrs. Van Hopper (\"Du wirst niemals eine Lady\"). The widowed aristocrat Maxim de Winter arrives at the hotel; he initially treats the young woman coolly but later explains to her that his actual aversion was to Mrs. Van Hopper. As the two become increasingly friendly, the hotel guests speculate about the nature of their relationship, their differences in age and class, and Maxim's devotion to his late wife, Rebecca (\"Er verlor unerwartet seine Frau, Rebecca\"). In the hills near Monte Carlo, Maxim and the young woman share a kiss; she is distraught when Mrs. Van Hopper informs her that they will be returning to New York but resolves to find joy and strength in her memories of Maxim (\"Zeit in einer Flasche\"). Maxim witnesses her private outpouring of emotion, and he proposes marriage. Disregarding Mrs. Van Hopper's warnings that she cannot live up to her predecessor, she elopes with Maxim (\"Zauberhaft nat\u00fcrlich\").\n\nAs the servants of Manderley welcome Maxim and his bride from their honeymoon, they speculate about their new mistress and the cold greeting afforded to her by the haughty head housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (\"Die neue Mrs. de Winter\"). While tending to Rebecca's orchids, Mrs. Danvers privately laments the loss of her beautiful, elegant and mysterious mistress (\"Sie ergibt sich nicht\"); when Mrs. de Winter accidentally intrudes upon her, Mrs. Danvers intimidates the young woman by showing her Rebecca's extensive social calendar. Mrs. de Winter's introduction to Maxim's sister Beatrice and brother-in-law Giles goes well (\"Die lieben Verwandten\"), but Mrs. Danvers provokes an argument between the newlyweds (\"Bist du gl\u00fccklich \u2013 Bist du b\u00f6se\"), who each reflect privately about how they are seeking solace in each other (\"Hilf mir durch die Nacht\"). At her house, Beatrice reflects on her affection for her brother and how he has changed in the past year (\"Was ist nur los mit ihm\"). Rebecca's cousin Jack Favell comes to Manderley as a guest; although he and Mrs. Danvers share a private understanding of Rebecca's inner life, his entitlement to Rebecca's possessions and insistence that she loved him upsets Mrs. Danvers (\"Sie war gewohnt geliebt zu werden\"). Upon encountering Favell, Mrs. de Winter is persuaded to keep the knowledge of his presence at Manderley from Maxim. In preparation for an upcoming masked ball, Mrs. Danvers suggests that Mrs. de Winter wear a ball gown in homage to a portrait of one of Maxim's ancestors; although her overt hostility to the young woman subsides, she continues to reverently describe Maxim's first wife and even her belongings (\"Rebecca\").\n\nBen, an intellectually disabled man, meets Mrs. de Winter in the Manderley boat house (\"Sie's fort\") and compares her favorably to Rebecca, describing her predecessor as vindictive and cruel. Upon learning that his wife is at the boathouse, Maxim flies into an inexplicable fury and expresses his anger that Rebecca's absence continues to cast a shadow over his marriage (\"Gott, warum\"). When Mrs. de Winter voices her insecurities to Frank Crawley, the manager of the estate and Maxim's best friend, he reassures her that she doesn't need to try to emulate Rebecca's social accomplishments (\"Ehrlichkeit und vertrauen\"). At the ball (\"Der Ball von Manderley\"), Mrs. Van Hopper performs (\"I'm an American Woman\"). As Mrs. de Winter changes into the ball gown suggested by Mrs. Danvers, she hopes that she will impress both the guests and Maxim (\"Heut' nacht verzauber' ich die Welt\"), but as she descends the staircase to the party, the guests look on in horror; the dress Mrs. de Winter is wearing is the same one Rebecca had worn at last year's ball. Maxim bursts into a rage, his bride flees the ball in tears, and Mrs. Danvers looks on malevolently.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe following evening, Mrs. de Winter attempts to explain herself (\"Und das, und das, und das\"), only to be menaced by Mrs. Danvers (\"Tu nicht, was sie emp\u00f6rt!\" ... \"Nur ein schritt\"). At the seaside, the people of Cornwall find the wreck of Rebecca's sailing boat with her body inside the cabin (\"Strandgut\"). Mrs. de Winter encounters Ben and a disheveled Maxim, who had gone to help the sailors; Maxim explains to his wife that Rebecca was a deceitful person who manipulated him into marriage and had multiple affairs. When Maxim confronted Rebecca about her incestuous affair with Jack Favell, an altercation ensued in which Maxim pushed Rebecca, causing her to suffer a concussion and die; in a panic, he took her body to the boat and scuttled it (\"Kein L\u00e4chenln war je so kalt\"). Maxim is suspected of having killed Rebecca, and his implausible alibi leads to an official investigation of his involvement in her murder. Mrs. de Winter comforts a terrified Beatrice, who remarks on her sister-in-law's strength and courage (Die St\u00e4rker Einer Frau). A newly confident Mrs. de Winter redecorates Manderley to her own tastes, brushing aside the furious comments of a shocked Mrs. Danvers (\"Mrs. de Winter bin Ich\").\n\nAt a preliminary hearing, Maxim responds poorly to a line of questioning by the local coroner. Mrs. de Winter faints, prompting Maxim and his supporters' return to Manderley. Jack Favell arrives in their wake and is welcomed into the library by Mrs. Danvers (\"Eine Hand w\u00e4scht die andre\"); he attempts to blackmail Maxim with a letter from Rebecca, expressing her love for Favell and fear of Maxim. Mrs. Danvers provides Rebecca's diary, which reveals that she had seen a doctor on the day she died. Favell speculates that Rebecca was pregnant with his child, and that Maxim killed her in a jealous rage. Mrs. de Winter travels to London to visit the doctor Rebecca had seen, while Maxim is ordered to stay at Manderley until the truth is ascertained. The servants and Mrs. Danvers comment on the situation (\"Sie fuhr'n um acht\"). Maxim receives a phone call from his wife, overheard by Mrs. Danvers; Mrs. de Winter explains that Rebecca was suffering from terminal cancer and likely provoked Maxim to murder her so she could avert the slow and painful death she dreaded.\n\nNow cleared of all charges, Maxim meets his wife at the train station in Cornwall, and they reunite passionately (\"Jenseits der Nacht\"). As they approach Manderley, they see a red glow in the distance and realize that the manor has been set on fire by Mrs. Danvers to destroy the evidence against her.  As the servants attempt to extinguish the blaze (\"Manderley in Flammen\"), Mrs. Danvers stands atop the grand staircase, holding Rebecca's nightgown and setting the handrails on fire. The de Winters arrive in time to help evacuate Manderley, but the house collapses and Mrs. Danvers perishes.\n\nMrs. de Winter walks dreamily in darkness, reflecting on how she has grown from her experiences (\"Ich hab getraumt von Manderley\" (reprise)); the shadows of Manderley now have faces, and her fears have vanished. Under a bright blue sky, Maxim holds his hand out to his wife, and they kiss.",

        "title": "Lady and the Tramp",
        "description": "Lady and the Tramp is a 1955 American animated musical romantic comedy film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Film Distribution . Based on Ward Greene 's 1945 Cosmopolitan magazine story \"Happy Dan, the Cynical Dog\", it was directed by Hamilton Luske , Clyde Geronimi , and Wilfred Jackson . The film features the voices of Peggy Lee , Barbara Luddy , Larry Roberts , Bill Thompson , Bill Baucom, Stan Freberg , Verna Felton , Alan Reed , George Givot , Dallas McKennon , and Lee Millar. The film follows Lady, the pampered Cocker Spaniel , as she grows from puppy to adult, deals with changes in her family, and meets and falls in love with the homeless mutt Tramp.\n\nThe inspiration for Lady and the Tramp originated in 1925 when Walt Disney presented his wife Lillian with a chow puppy in a hatbox. In 1937, Joe Grant , a storyboard artist, pitched to Disney an original idea as inspired by his English Springer Spaniel . Throughout the 1940s, the project underwent numerous story revisions, but it was shelved due to Disney's production of several package films . Grant left the Disney studios in 1949.\n\nIn 1952, Disney placed the project back into active development, and the final story was revised by Erdman Penner and Joe Rinaldi. The film's art direction was supervised by Claude Coats , who took inspiration from gingerbread architecture . Peggy Lee and Sonny Burke wrote the film's original songs, while Oliver Wallace composed the instrumental musical score. During production, Disney decided Lady and the Tramp would be the first animated film to be filmed in the CinemaScope widescreen film process. It was also Disney's first animated film to be distributed by their Buena Vista division following their split from RKO Radio Pictures .\n\nLady and the Tramp was released in theaters on June 22, 1955, and achieved box office success. While it initially received mixed reviews from critics, the film's critical reception has grown more favorable over time, and it is now regarded as one of the greatest animated films of all time . The film launched a long-running Disney comic strip featuring Scamp . A direct-to-video sequel, titled Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure , was released in 2001. A live-action/CGI hybrid remake premiered in 2019 as a launch title for the Disney+ streaming service. In 2023, Lady and the Tramp was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"",
        "synopsis": "In 1909, in a small town, \"Jim Dear\" gives his wife \"Darling\" a cocker spaniel puppy as a Christmas present. The puppy, named Lady, grows up pampered by her doting owners, and befriends her neighbors' dogs Jock (a Scottie ) and Trusty (an elderly Bloodhound ). Meanwhile, across town, a stray terrier -mix named Tramp spends his days wandering the streets, feeding on scraps and handouts, and causing trouble for the local dogcatcher .\n\nFleeing the angry dogcatcher after freeing his friends, Peg the Pekingese and Bull the Bulldog , Tramp finds himself in Lady's neighborhood. He overhears a distraught Lady conversing with Jock and Trusty about her owners' suddenly distant behavior towards her. When Jock and Trusty deduce this is because Darling is pregnant , Tramp inserts himself into the conversation as the \"voice of experience\", and warns Lady that \"when a baby moves in, a dog moves out\". Annoyed, Jock drives him from the yard. Tramp's words cause Lady to fret throughout Darling's pregnancy, but when the baby boy arrives, she is allowed to meet and bond with him, dispelling her fears.\n\nLater, Jim Dear and Darling take a short trip, leaving the house, Lady, and the baby in the care of Jim Dear's aunt Sarah, who brings along her two Siamese cats , Si and Am. Sarah dislikes dogs, and prohibits Lady from seeing the baby; later, the cats destroy the house and pin the deed on Lady by pretending she injured them. Sarah takes Lady to the pet shop and has a muzzle put on her; Lady panics and flees into the street, where she is pursued by three savage dogs, until Tramp intervenes to protect her.\n\nTramp takes Lady to the zoo to have the muzzle removed by a beaver ; he then shows Lady his owner-free lifestyle, and they explore the town. The kindly proprietor of Tony's Restaurant gives them a spaghetti dinner to share, before they end the evening with a walk in the park.\nThe next day, Tramp tries to convince Lady to live \"footloose and collar free\" with him; despite liking Tramp, she decides her duty is to watch over the baby. As Tramp escorts Lady home, he stops to chase some chickens; the dogcatcher pursues them both, but only Lady is caught. At the pound , she meets Peg, Bull, and some other strays, who all know Tramp. They reveal he has had many girlfriends in the past, and claim that females are his weakness.\n\nSarah comes to claim Lady, and chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away. Jock and Trusty propose that Lady should marry and come live with one of them, to escape the abuse, but she gently refuses them. When Tramp arrives to apologize to Lady, she berates him for his many girlfriends and sends him away, too. Afterwards, Lady notices a large rat sneaking into the house through the baby's bedroom window. Her attempts to alert Sarah fail, but Tramp hears her barking, returns, and enters the house himself to save the baby. Lady breaks her chain and follows soon after. Tramp is wounded in the battle with the rat, but manages to kill it behind a curtain. During the struggle, the baby's crib overturns, and he begins to cry; Sarah comes to investigate, and assumes the dogs attacked the baby.\n\nJim Dear and Darling return home to find that Sarah has locked Lady in the cellar and handed Tramp over to the dogcatcher to be euthanized. Disbelieving Sarah's story, Jim Dear frees Lady, who immediately shows them the dead rat. Overhearing the truth, Jock and Trusty pursue the dogcatcher's cart and try to stop it; the horses spook, causing the cart to crash. Jim Dear and Darling arrive with Lady to rescue Tramp, but Trusty is badly injured in the wreck.\n\nLater, at Christmastime, Tramp has become an official part of the family, and he and Lady have four little puppies of their own. Jock and a mostly healed Trusty visit the family; the puppies now provide Trusty a new audience for his old stories, but he has forgotten them, much to his and everyone else's amusement.",

        "synopsis": "In the Golden Gate Restaurant in San Francisco in 1927, tired and harassed young waitress Cleo commiserates with her friend. Cleo's feet hurt (\"Ooh My Feet\") and her friend has had to fend off the cashier's advances (\"I Know How It Is\"). As they clean up (\"Seven Million Crumbs\"), Cleo's friend finds a jeweled tie pin and a note addressed to the friend as \"Rosabella\", written in odd broken English (\"I Don't Know (The Letter)\"). She decides to answer, thinking of the possibilities (\"Somebody, Somewhere\").\n\nIn Napa , the mailman has a letter for Tony Esposito, who has been enjoying a \"mail order love affair\" for the past four months. Tony, a large and hearty older Italian immigrant and a successful grape farmer, happily shows the crowd the picture of his \"girlfriend\" (\"The Most Happy Fella\"). Meek farmhand Herman expresses admiration of his boss's initiative in pursuing Rosabella (\" Standing on the Corner \"). But as Tony prepares to send his own picture in return, his sister Marie points out that he is too old and unattractive for a beautiful young woman like Rosabella, and he accepts that she is probably right. At that moment Joe, the young, handsome and nomadic farm foreman, arrives to tell Tony that he plans to leave town and travel somewhere else (\"Joey, Joey, Joey\"). Tony sees his opportunity and asks Joe for a photograph as a memento, then sends it as his own to his beloved (\"Rosabella\").\n\nSeveral weeks later, Rosabella has agreed to come to Napa and marry Tony (\"Abbondanza\"), but as he prepares to leave for the bus station to collect her, imagining their future together (\"Plenty Bambini\"), he discovers to his horror that Joe has remained in town longer than planned to attend the wedding (\"Spozalizio\"). Rosabella arrives at the farm with the postman (\"Special Delivery,\" \"Benvenuta\") and meets Joe (\"Aren't You Glad?\"), only to discover that he is not Tony. Upset at the subterfuge, she starts to leave. However, Tony has been injured in a truck accident en route to the bus station, and he pleads with Rosabella to stay and marry him immediately in case he does not live. She relents (\"No Home, No Job\") and they marry. Joe, who now must stay to run the ranch during Tony's convalescence, is upset but tries to comfort her (\"Don't Cry\"), and in a moment of mutual weakness they embrace.\n\nA week later (\"Fresno Beauties\"), Joe and Rosabella regret their indiscretion (\"Cold and Dead\"), and at the encouragement of Tony's doctor (\"Love and Kindness\"), the newlywed couple makes a fresh start (\"Happy to Make Your Acquaintance\"). Cleo arrives in Napa, revealing that Tony has sent for her and offered her a job to keep Rosabella company, and she immediately takes a dislike to Marie (\"I Don't Like This Dame\") but hits it off with fellow Texan Herman (\"Big D\"). As time passes, Tony and Rosabella grow closer, Marie feels increasingly lonely, and Joe longs to travel again (\"How Beautiful the Days\"). Marie tries to convince Tony that the age difference between him and Rosabella is too great (\"Young People\"), and he believes her even though Rosabella herself indicates otherwise (\"Warm All Over\"). Cleo and Herman also grow closer, though she is frustrated by his passive, compliant nature (\"I Like Everybody\"). She urges Rosabella to tell Tony of her feelings, as Tony is treating her like a child rather than a wife (\"I Love Him/I Know How it Is\"). Tony, overjoyed by Rosabella's expression of love (\"Like a Woman Loves a Man\"), discards his cane (\"My Heart Is So Full of You\"). Later Rosabella collapses at a party (\"Hoedown\"), and the doctor tells her she is pregnant (with Joe's child). She is upset by this news, and Cleo rushes her away before she can tell the still-overjoyed Tony (\"Mamma, Mamma\").\n\nIn Tony's barn a short time later, Cleo hints to Herman that she may be leaving (\"Goodbye, Darlin'\") but he remains unbelievingly cheerful, to her frustration. As the preparations for the wedding party are taking place, the doctor asks the community to leave the couple alone for a little while (\"Song of a Summer Night\"). Rosabella tells Tony she is pregnant (\"Please Let Me Tell You\"). Tony rejects her in a rage when she reveals that Joe is the father. She and Cleo leave to return to San Francisco, but when Tony learns that Joe is leaving as well, he concludes that they are leaving together and rushes to the bus station with a gun to confront them. When he discovers that Joe has already left (\"Tell Tony and Rosabella Goodbye for Me\"), however, he resolves to forgive her (\"She Gonna Come Home Wit' Me\"). Marie begs her brother to let her go (\"Nobody's Ever Gonna Love You\") and snatches away his cane to prevent him from leaving, but Cleo attacks her and grabs it back. Brutish farmhand Pasquale intervenes in the struggle, and Herman finally finds the nerve to stand up for her by striking Pasquale (\"I Made a Fist\"). Tony convinces Rosabella to return to their home, where they will tell their friends and the townspeople Tony is the father.  Reunited with Rosabella and soon to be a father, Tony affirms that he truly is \"the most happy fella.\"  (\"Finale\").",

        "title": "Gigi (musical)",
        "description": "Gigi is a musical with a book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe . It is based on the 1944 novella Gigi by Colette and 1958 hit musical film of the same name.  The story concerns Gigi, a free-spirited teenaged girl living in Paris at the turn of the 20th century.  She is being groomed as a courtesan in her family's tradition. Before she is deemed ready for her social debut, she encounters the bon vivant bachelor Gaston Lachaille, whom she captivates as she is transformed into a charmingly poised young lady.\n\nThe original Broadway production, produced by Edwin Lester in 1973, ran for a disappointing 103 performances but won the Tony Award for Best Score.  A West End production played in 1985.\n\nA new production of the musical starring Vanessa Hudgens , adapted by Heidi Thomas and directed by Eric D. Schaeffer , premiered at the Kennedy Center (Washington, DC) in January 2015, and ran on Broadway from April 8 to June 21, 2015 at the Neil Simon Theatre .",
        "synopsis": "Honor\u00e9 Lachaille explains that in turn-of-the-20th-century Paris, marriage is not the only option. His nephew Gaston is a rich bon vivant, much like his uncle. But Gaston is bored with the high life and his series of mistresses. The one thing he truly enjoys is spending time with an old friend of his uncle, Madame Alvarez, whom he calls Mamita, and especially her granddaughter, the precocious, carefree Gilberte or \"Gigi\".  Gaston's Uncle Honor\u00e9 was involved romantically with Mamita, although advancing age has confused their recollections of the past.\n\nMadame Alvarez sends Gigi to her Aunt Alicia's to learn to be a high-society courtesan in their family's tradition. Gigi is initially a very poor student, as she does not understand the reasons behind her education and finds Parisians' obsession with making love inexplicable. She does, however, enjoy spending time with Gaston, whom she treats as an older brother.  Alicia is unhappy to discover that Gaston took Gigi and Madame Alvarez on holiday, as her sister had not consulted her.  She insists that Gigi's education must increase dramatically if she is to catch a prize such as Gaston. Mamita is shocked, but sees the advantages it could bring Gigi and so goes along with the plan - though neither tells Gigi of their scheming. Gigi is miserable in her lessons, but puts up with them as a necessary evil, though she still seems awkward and bumbling to her perfectionist aunt.\n\nGaston visits and is shocked to see Gigi in an alluring white gown. He tells her she looks ridiculous and storms out, but returns later and apologizes, offering to make it up by taking her to dinner. Mamita refuses, telling Gaston that, with his reputation, a young girl seen in his company might be labelled in such a way as could damage her future. Gaston is enraged again, storms out, and wanders the streets of Paris in a fury.\n\nGaston realises that he has fallen in love with Gigi. He returns to Mamita and strikes a business arrangement to take Gigi as his mistress, promising to provide the girl with luxury and kindness. He visits Gigi later, but she tells him she does not wish to become someone's mistress; she wants more for herself than to be passed between men, only desired until they grow tired of her and she is moved on to another. Gaston is horrified at this portrayal of the life he wishes to give her, and leaves stunned. Later, however, Gigi contacts him; when Gaston returns, Gigi says she would \"rather be miserable with [him] than without [him].\"\n\nLater that night Gigi emerges from her room prepared to accept her fate and take up her role as Gaston's mistress. For the first time, she appears as a woman, not a young girl. Gaston is enchanted when he picks Gigi up to take her to dinner at Maxim's, a popular Paris restaurant. Gigi's awkwardness is gone and she seems perfectly at ease. Nevertheless, patrons' stares make Gaston uncomfortable as he realises Gigi's interpretation of things may have been accurate after all.  He discovers that his love for her makes the idea of her as his mistress an unbearable one. Angered by Honor\u00e9's comments, Gaston leaves the party with Gigi in tow, taking her home without explanation. A weeping Gigi begs to know what she has done to offend him, but Gaston does not answer until he arrives at Mamita's and humbly asks for Gigi's hand in marriage.",

        "description": "Maggie May is a musical with a book by Alun Owen and music and lyrics by Lionel Bart .  Based on \"Maggie May\" , a traditional ballad about a Liverpool prostitute, it deals with trade union ethics and disputes among Irish-Catholic dockers in Liverpool, centring on the life of streetwalker Margaret Mary Duffy and her sweetheart, a freewheeling sailor.\n\nThe show includes bittersweet ballads , robust chorus numbers, and even some rock 'n' roll , making it one of the most musically diverse British scores of the 1960s. Steven Suskin, in reviewing a newly released CD, wrote: the show begins with a \"rather weird folk-ballad\", and has \"a couple of gentle lullaby-like ballads...raucous production numbers... a tongue-twister, set to an almost violent waltz\", along with a distinctive version of the title song \"which mixes a sailor's chanty with \u2014 what, Dixieland?\".",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nPatrick Casey is a young sailor from a Catholic Liverpool-Irish family. His father was a famous trades union leader, who was killed during a strike. Patrick rejects his father's advice in order to live a life of exploration and adventure as an ocean going seaman. Back in Liverpool, his childhood sweetheart, Margaret Duffy, has become a popular dockland prostitute known as Maggie May. All the sailors are devoted to her because of her generous nature; however she is still in love with Patrick, and calls all her clients \"Casey\".\n\nPatrick returns to Liverpool to work on the docks, and is greeted by the other dock workers. He tells a tale about his visit to an African country, where he was expected to participate in a militia to put down demonstrations by exploited African workers, but refused. The other dockers see him as a potential leader in their struggles, but he refuses to become involved and attempts to revive his relationship with Maggie.\n\n### Act II\n\nAs Maggie starts to hope for a new life with Patrick, she discovers he has been drawn into plans for a dock strike, leading to an argument between them. To get back at Patrick, Maggie becomes involved with Willie Morgan, a corrupt local deal-maker. Patrick discovers that a shipment at the docks comprises weapons for police in apartheid South Africa. He and other workers decide to sabotage the weapons. Maggie breaks with Willie, and she and Patrick commit to each other. The sabotage plan is betrayed and Patrick is killed in a fight over the weapons. Maggie is left devastated and with no option but to continue working as a prostitute.",

        "description": "Lend Me A Tenor is a musical with book and Lyrics by Peter Sham and music by Brad Carroll. The musical is based on the 1986 play of the same name by Ken Ludwig . There are several notable changes from the play turning it into a full-on musical comedy. Changes include major plot revisions between Tito Merrelli (opera star) and Saunders (opera director), eliminating Frank the Bellhop (one of the lead roles in the play), adding the role of Bernie, the stage manager, expanding the role of Julia into a musical trio of Saunders' three ex-wives, upping the mistaken identity farce from two to the magic number of three and making every character more three-dimensional than the original play. Perhaps the most important change the musical made to the play is the substitution of the opera within the musical, from Otello to Pagliacci ; this change removes questionable elements from Ludwig's play, raising the hilarity to three men running around as opera clowns (Canios) rather than dressed as Otellos. Mr. Ludwig has gone on to appropriate Sham & Carroll's substitution idea in a subsequent revision of his play.",

        "title": "Trial by Jury",
        "description": "Trial by Jury is a comic opera in one act, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert .  It was first produced on 25 March 1875, at London's Royalty Theatre , where it initially ran for 131\u00a0performances and was considered a hit, receiving critical praise and outrunning its popular companion piece, Jacques Offenbach 's La P\u00e9richole .  The story concerns a \" breach of promise of marriage\" lawsuit in which the judge and legal system are the objects of lighthearted satire .  Gilbert based the libretto of Trial by Jury on an operetta parody that he had written in 1868.\n\nThe opera premiered more than three years after Gilbert and Sullivan 's only previous collaboration, Thespis , an 1871\u201372 Christmas season entertainment. In the intervening years, both the author and the composer were busy with separate projects. Beginning in 1873, Gilbert tried several times to get the opera produced before the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte suggested that he collaborate on it with Sullivan. Sullivan was pleased with the piece and promptly wrote the music.\n\nAs with most Gilbert and Sullivan operas, the plot of Trial by Jury is ludicrous, but the characters behave as if the events were perfectly reasonable.  This narrative technique blunts some of the pointed barbs aimed at hypocrisy, especially of those in authority, and the sometimes base motives of supposedly respectable people and institutions.  These themes became favourites of Gilbert through the rest of his collaborations with Sullivan.  Critics and audiences praised how well Sullivan's witty and good-humoured music complemented Gilbert's satire. The success of Trial by Jury launched the famous series of 13\u00a0collaborative works between Gilbert and Sullivan that came to be known as the Savoy Operas .\n\nAfter its original production in 1875, Trial by Jury toured widely in Britain and elsewhere and was frequently revived and recorded. It also became popular for benefit performances. The work continues to be frequently played, especially as a companion piece to other short Gilbert and Sullivan operas or other works.  According to the theatre scholar Kurt G\u00e4nzl , it is \"probably the most successful British one-act operetta of all time\".",
        "synopsis": "It is 10 a.m. at the Court of the Exchequer , where a jury and the public assemble to hear a case of breach of promise of marriage.\n\nThe Usher advises the jury to listen to the broken-hearted Plaintiff's case, adding that they \"needn't mind\" what the \"ruffianly defendant\" has to say. He notes, for the record, that \"From bias free of every kind, this trial must be tried!\" The Defendant (Edwin) arrives, and the jurymen greet him with hostility, even though, as he points out, they have as yet no idea of the merits of his case. He candidly tells them that he jilted the Plaintiff because she became a \"bore intense\" to him, and he then quickly took up with another woman. The jurymen recall their own wayward youth, but as they are now respectable gentlemen they have no sympathy for the Defendant.\n\nThe Judge enters with great pomp and describes how he rose to his position\u00a0\u2013 by courting a rich attorney's \"elderly, ugly daughter\". The rich attorney then aided his prospective son-in-law's legal career until the Judge \"became as rich as the Gurneys \" and \"threw over\" the daughter. The jury and public are delighted with the Judge, although he has just admitted to the same wrong of which the Defendant is accused.\n\nThe jury is sworn in, and the Plaintiff (Angelina) is summoned. She is preceded into the courtroom by her bridesmaids, one of whom catches the eye of the Judge. However, when Angelina herself arrives in full wedding dress, she instantly captures the heart of both Judge and jury. The Counsel for the Plaintiff makes a moving speech detailing Edwin's betrayal. Angelina feigns distress and staggers, first into the arms of the Foreman of the Jury, and then of the Judge. Edwin counters, explaining that his change of heart is only natural:\n\nHe offers to marry both the Plaintiff and his new love, if that would satisfy everyone. The Judge at first finds this \"a reasonable proposition\", but the Counsel argues that from the days of James II , it has been \"a rather serious crime / To marry two wives at a time\"; he labels the crime not \" bigamy \", but rather \" burglary \". Perplexed, everyone in court ponders the \"nice dilemma\" in a parody of Italian opera ensembles.\n\nAngelina desperately embraces Edwin, demonstrating the depth of her love, and bemoans her loss \u2013 all in evidence of the large amount of damages that the jury should require Edwin to pay. Edwin, in turn, says he is a smoker, a drunkard, and a bully (when tipsy), and that the Plaintiff could not have endured him even for a day; thus the damages should be small. The Judge suggests making Edwin tipsy to see if he would really \"thrash and kick\" Angelina, but everyone else (except Edwin) objects to this experiment. Impatient at the lack of progress, the Judge resolves the case by offering to marry Angelina himself. This is found quite satisfactory and the proceedings are concluded with \"joy unbounded\".",

After the performance has wrapped, an interviewer asks Betty a question that makes her reflect: \"Who is the real Betty Boop?\" Betty replies, \"Whoever you want me to be!\" At Betty\u2019s house, Grampy is cooking dinner in one of his great inventions. Another of Grampy's inventions is a teleporter to the real world. Betty wishes to go there, but Grampy refuses to send her. After Grampy falls asleep, Betty wishes for a world where no one would recognize her (\"Ordinary Day\"). Betty uses Grampy's invention to travel to the real world and ends up at New York Comic Con .\n\nShe meets Dwayne, commenting on his bright blue eyes. Betty, confused by all the colors, starts to learn about them (\"In Color\"). She next meets and befriends Trisha, a Betty Boop superfan, dressed in Betty's style. Betty is surprised that people know her and finds that she is as famous here as at home. Betty takes on the name Betsy Crampwhiler to disguise her true identity. Back in ToonTown, Grampy discovers that Betty is gone and has used his invention. He laments about what will happen to ToonTown without Betty (\"Get Her Back!\"). Grampy and Pudgy, Betty's dog, use the invention to follow Betty to the real world to search for her.\n\nAt Trisha's house, Betty reunites with Dwayne, who lives with Trisha. Betty reveals that she is a jazz singer, and Dwayne demonstrates that he is a jazz musician (\"I Speak Jazz\"). Meanwhile, Raymond Demarest is running for mayor of New York with his slogan, \"You can Do Do it!\" In Trisha's room, Betty asks why Trisha likes Betty so much. Trisha says that she wishes she could be as confident as Betty (\"Portrait of Betty\"). Betty then confides that she is the real Betty Boop, not Betsy.\n\nAlternating between ToonTown and New York, the Director, Oscar Delacorte, his Assistant, Clarence, and Dwayne explain that Betty (Dwayne still knows her as Betsy) is the sunlight in their lives (\"Sunlight\"). Betty and Trisha meet Dwayne at the red steps in Times Square ; Dwayne shares the story of his life in New York (\"My New York\"). Grampy reunites with Valentina, a NASA scientist with whom he had a romance.

When Betty shocks everyone with how much she sounds and looks like Betty Boop, they chant \"That's Betty Boop!\" and Betty says she is right where she wants to be (\"Where I Wanna Be!\").\n\nAct Two\n\nAfter Betty has revealed that she is alive and in New York, she wishes she had kept it to herself. The people in ToonTown hope she will come back to them (\"Where is Betty\"). Raymond uses Betty as his campaign manager but refuses to let her speak (\"Where is Betty\" (reprise)). At Nelly\u2019s, Dwayne laments that he loves Betty so much, but she is not a real person (\"She Knocks Me Out\"). Trisha thinks she is not good enough and has to dress up as Boop to feel confident.

At Raymond's office, Raymond hits on Betty and tries to take advantage of her, so she hits him in the face with a lamp (\"Take It to the Next Level\").

In the musical, Lempicka must establish a new life for herself and her family in Paris after escaping the 1917 Russian Revolution . The musical features music by Matt Gould, lyrics by Carson Kreitzer , with a book by Gould and Kreitzer from an original concept by Kreitzer.\n\nThe show opened on Broadway at the Longacre Theatre on April 14, 2024 and closed on May 19, 2024 following 41 performances.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nLempicka opens with an older version of Tamara de Lempicka muttering to herself while painting in 1970s California. She describes her woes of loving two people at once and reminisces on her life, asking \"How did I wind up here?\" The screen behind Tamara opens up and she changes to become a younger version of herself (Poland, 1918) (\"Unseen\"). Tamara is in a wedding dress, painting, as we are introduced to her mother and then Tadeusz Lempicki, a Polish aristocrat and the man she will be marrying. Tadeusz\u2019s father mentions his distaste for Tamara, whose late father was Jewish.\n\nAfter the wedding, Tadeusz is arrested for plotting with the Tsar as the Russian Revolution is underway. Tamara is able to convince two guards to let her through to her husband by paying them with expensive jewelry, but the third guard is not moved and insists that Tamara give him her body to use for the night. Tamara gives in and frees Tadeusz (\"Our Time\"). Now, Tamara and Tadeusz are on a train to Paris, Tamara hopes that their daughter, Kizette, will never have to experience their hardships, as Tadeusz ponders how his wife got him out (\"Starting Over\").\n\nWhen they arrive, Tamara comments that Paris is the \"ugliest beautiful city\" she's ever seen. Tadeusz continues asking how she got him out, but Tamara does not tell him. Tamara encourages her husband to get a job, because they have no remaining money, jewels, or political influence to help them survive in Paris, but Tadeusz is insulted by her suggestion that he take a bank job or, worse, that she look for work herself. Eventually, Tamara sees a painter selling his work and decides that she could make a living by painting. She attempts to create a still life painting of \"Three Madeleines\" before eating them all and deciding she should stick to human subjects. Tamara attempts to sell art to the Baron and the Baroness, the former of who recommends she goes to see Filippo Tommaso Marinetti to teach her art. Marinetti asks Tamara to show him something he hasn't seen before. Then, the scene switches to Tamara painting in her home, with Kizette, now a child, and Tadeusz dancing, the Baron shows up and she sells two paintings. Armistice is declared and Tamara sees her chance with painting in Paris (\"Paris\").\n\nTamara is with Marinetti in his studio as he reprimands her paintings of nude women. Tamara argues that it is her job as a painter to capture life as it is, with all its imperfections, while Marinetti argues that \"a painting is not a woman... a painting is a flat surface, covered with paint,\" and that she, as the painter, should endeavor to paint perfection to way it cannot exist in the real world - \u201cwe do not control the world, we control one flat rectangle of canvas at a time\u201d (\"Plan and Design\"). Outside, a car drives in with Rafaela, the \u201csongbird of the streets,\u201d on top. She sings about how love is like roulette and not worth it, and Tamara wonders who she is, before Rafaela and her friend Suzy Solidor run away when the police arrive (\"Don't Bet Your Heart\"). Tamara is inspired, and sets out to paint Rafaela, saying that she \"won't rest 'til [she has] her.. portrait\" (\"I Will Paint Her\").\n\nTamara is exhibiting at her first group show, to much criticism. where Marinetti is once again annoyed of all the repetitive art that Tamara and the other artists have created. He sings about Futurism and a distaste for humanity, claiming that only machines can acquire perfection (\"Perfection\"). Tamara then asks if she can paint Rafaela, promising her immortality as an image. Then, Tadeusz walks in before applying for his first job, reflecting on his new life and everything he's lost. He isn't sure how to be strong enough for his wife (\"Wake Up\").\n\nTamara returns several times to the Dead Rat Cafe in search of Rafaela. Then, she is at home painting as Kizette tries to get her mother to pay attention to her instead of her easel for once (\"Mama Look at Me\"). Tamara asks Kizette to call her \"Ch\u00e9rie\" instead of \"Mama.\" The scene shifts back to the Dead Rat, where Tamara has finally found Rafaela again. Tamara discusses her vision for the painting, and they discuss their pasts; Rafaela\u2019s as a prostitute on the fringe of society and Tamara once again thinking about how she traded her body for her husband\u2019s life. The two share a charged moment of chemistry, when Rafaela helps Tamara smoke from her opium pipe by blowing the smoke into her mouth. Suzy warns Rafaela about being seen acting this way with Tamara in public, and fantasizes about the future when she will open her own club where they can finally be themselves. Rafaela sings a song for the patrons of the club, flirting with the men but looking only at Tamara (\u201cThe Most Beautiful Bracelet\u201d). After leaving the club, the two kiss, and spend the night in Tamara\u2019s studio. Tamara paints Rafaela as she sleeps (\u201cWoman Is\u201d).\n\n### Act 2\n\nTamara shows her portrait of Rafaela to the Baron and Baroness, and signs it as \u201cLempicka\u201d instead of the male version of her surname that she had previously used. Marinetti sings about Paris being immovable after World War I , that the stock market crashes will not disturb them, and that there will never be another Great War. Chilling images of World War II are projected behind him as the song becomes more frenzied and time spins forward to 1933. The Baroness worries about Adolf Hitler \u2019s rising power and wonders if her husband, who is of Jewish origin, will be safe. Tamara, whose father was also Jewish, plans for any emergency that would require her family to need to leave the country. Meanwhile, she is said to be taking over Paris with her artwork (\"Pari Will Always Be Pari\").\n\nTadeusz returns home to see his wife painting, and they discuss not being a normal couple and the fact that they are both seeing other women. Tadeusz compares Tamara to the \u201c New Woman ,\u201d the feminist ideal taking over Europe. He jokes that his life would be easier if he found a new woman who would act demure and do whatever he wanted, but concludes that he doesn\u2019t need anything as long as he is with a woman who loves him, and he hopes that Tamara can still be that woman. He also mentions being offered a job in Warsaw , and asks Tamara to move back to Poland with him. (\"The New Woman\"). Tamara and Rafaela go to Suzy's new lesbian club, The Monocle. Suzy sings about the beauty of women, and many in the room talk to and commission Tamara due to her newfound fame (\"Women\").\n\nRafaela tells Tamara that she wants to go to one of her art shows, which Tamara forbids because she doesn't want anyone to know about them being lovers. Tamara gives Rafaela a  bracelet and professes her love. Rafaela sings about her backstory and about how she might stay with a lover for once, juxtaposing her previous assertion that \"love is for fools.\" (\u201cStay\u201d). When Rafaela is alone, Kizette enters the studio and manipulates Rafaela into seeing Tamara at the International Exposition. Tamara relates herself to her painting of Adam and Eve.\n\nRafaela walks into the exposition, and Kizette drags Tadeusz there as well. Tadeusz and Rafaela see each other and discuss Tamara's view of both of them; Tadeusz says he is sure Tamara will stay with him, saying that \u201cshe needs me on her arm to get away with painting you,\u201d while Rafaela says she is the only one who can make her feel alive (\"What She Sees\"). They both confront Tamara, and the Baron and Baroness show up, along with Marinetti \u2014 he reveals that he has joined the Italian Fascists , who have adopted Futurism as their official art movement. The Baron and Baroness leave due to this news, and Marinetti cautions Tamara about being seen in public with Rafaela, telling her that her chance at greatness will shatter if news comes out about her being queer. He says that Paris will not be Paris for long. Tamara reflects on what might happen if she has to leave, and that she wants to be able to paint what is real rather than what is perfection (\"Here It Comes\").\n\nTadeusz confronts Tamara and tells her to choose between him and Rafaela. Tamara says she has always fought for everything but he hasn\u2019t.  Tadeusz says that she doesn't think about what he wants, and mentions that he met a woman named Irene. Tamara breaks down and tells him what she did to rescue him from the Russian prison. The scene changes to Rafaela, who attempts to give her bracelet back to Tamara. She says that she doesn't want to be hidden from the world, and asks Tamara to leave Tadeusz to be with her, but Tamara refuses, so Rafaela leaves. Tamara goes back to Tadeusz, but he says it's too late. Marinetti and the Blackshirts arrest Suzy and everybody in The Monocle, and the club is destroyed (\"Speed\").\n\nThe Baroness visits Tamara in her studio, where she finds that a devastated Tamara has injured herself by cutting her wrist. The Baroness says that she has just been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and doctors have told her she has two more months left to live. She asks that Tamara go to live with the Baron, and commissions a portrait of herself so that the Baron may always remember her (\"Just This Way\"). Tamara, Kizette, and the Baron move to Los Angeles , California. Tamara once again reminisces about her new life where she doesn't paint and doesn't exhibit anymore, and nobody seems to know who she is. She mentions how she has outlived everyone, mentioning both the Baron\u2019s passing (\"In The Blasted California Sun\").\n\nTamara imagines a vision of Rafaela, who tells her she will never know what truly happened to her after their relationship ended. When she asks Rafaela what her life was for with everything and everyone she loved now gone, Rafaela says that the \"sleek, powerful\" women Tamara painted long ago are now \"taking over the world.\" Some time later, her artwork is rediscovered in Paris, celebrated, and auctioned off for millions of dollars. The myriad women Tamara painted pass her by, and she realizes that by representing them as unique and diverse, she has fulfilled her vision of the future. Tamara looks out towards the audience, singing that \"We do not control the world. We control one flat rectangle of canvas at a time\" (\"Finale\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nA fictional medieval kingdom in 15th-century Europe is ruled by the devious Queen Aggravain and the mute King Sextimus the Silent. King Sextimus suffers from a curse cast by a witch that can only be reversed \"when the mouse devours the hawk.\" The Minstrel sings of the Princess and the Pea (\"Many Moons Ago\"), but reveals the story to be fake, though he knows the true tale because he was there when it happened. The princess in the story is not the first princess tested to see if she is worthy of marrying Prince Dauntless the Drab\u2014she is the thirteenth princess. The day the Minstrel arrives at court, the Queen, alongside her confidant, the Wizard, is testing Princess #12 with an unfair quiz. To the Queen's delight, the princess misses the last question: \"What was the middle name of the daughter-in-law of the best friend of the blacksmith who forged the sword that killed the Beast ?\" and is given a rubber chicken by Sir Studley. The populace of the castle complains about an unjust law levied by Queen Aggravain: \"Throughout the land no one may wed, 'till Dauntless shares his wedding bed.\"  However, every petitioning princess is sent away after failing unfair tests devised by the Queen. It seems that no one is good enough to marry Prince Dauntless (\"An Opening for a Princess\").\n\nThe crisis escalates when the leading knight of the realm, Sir Harry, discovers that his girlfriend, Lady Larken, is pregnant . Though Lady Larken says that she will run away so he will never have to face embarrassment and the loss of his station, Sir Harry decides that he will set out to find a princess himself (\"In a Little While\"). He petitions the Queen who immediately says no, but when Dauntless manages to speak up and beg, she gives in.\n\nThe Minstrel tells the audience that in the original story, the princess arrived at the castle on a stormy night (\"Many Moons Ago - Reprise\"), but in the true story, it was not night at all\u2014and the princess only looked as though she went through a storm. Princess Winnifred the Woebegone, a brash and unrefined princess from the Marshlands , was so eager to arrive that she swam the castle moat. She immediately charms Dauntless, Studley, and the knights and most of the kingdom (\"Shy\"). However, she also earns the utter loathing of the evil Queen, who vows to stop her.\n\nThe King discovers Larken's pregnancy and pantomimes this to his confidants, the Minstrel and the Jester. He tells them not to say a word, but they both are more worried about the King letting it slip, because even though he is mute, he can still communicate (\"The Minstrel, the Jester, and I\"). Later, the Queen, assisted by the Wizard, designs a test for Winnifred based on something they are sure she doesn\u2019t have at all\u2014sensitivity. They will place a tiny pea beneath twenty thick downy mattresses. If Winnifred is unable to sleep due to the pea, then she will be sensitive enough to marry Dauntless (\"Sensitivity\").\n\nMeanwhile, Winnifred tells Dauntless and the ladies in waiting about her home in the swamp (\"The Swamps of Home\") and meets the King, and they immediately like each other. Then, after spilling a purple vase filled with fresh new baby's breath, Winnifred is caught cleaning the mess by Lady Larken who mistakes her for a chambermaid . Soon Harry gets mad at Larken for her mistake and they get in a fight. Larken vows that she will run far far away where she will never see him again.\n\nThe King, the Minstrel and the Jester catch Larken trying to run away, and they try to stop her but in the end decide to help her escape to Normandy (\"Normandy\"). Later that night, the Queen throws a ball so Winnifred can dance the most exhausting dance in the world: \"The Spanish Panic\".  The Queen hopes that Winnifred will tire herself, but the plan fails. Winnifred is the last one standing as everyone collapses from exhaustion at the dance's climax. She asks Dauntless to try to give her a clue as to what the test might be, but he's not sure. He brings out a huge barbell that one of the princesses was asked to lift, but even he cannot lift it. Winnifred does easily and Dauntless admits that he loves her. Winnifred mentions that her nickname is Fred and Dauntless sings of his love for her as she practices numerous tasks she might have to do for the test, including singing, dancing, wrestling, acting, playing the Minstrel's lute , pantomiming and drinking herself unconscious (\"Song of Love\").\n\n### Act II\n\nLater that night, the Queen leads the knights and ladies as they carry the twenty mattresses to Fred's room (\"Quiet\"), and she catches the Minstrel, the Jester, the King, and Larken (disguised in Dauntless' clothes) running away. The Minstrel tries to protect Larken by saying he was escaping with Larken against her will. The Queen declares that the Minstrel will be banished by daybreak. Fred and Dauntless study for the test, and Fred convinces Larken to fix things with Harry. Larken leaves to find Harry, Dauntless bids Fred goodnight, and now she is left alone. While studying a fairy tale, she complains about how other fairy tale princesses had it easy and how she wants to live happily ever after (\"Happily Ever After\").  King Sextimus has a man to man talk  with Dauntless about the birds and the bees completely in pantomime (\"Man to Man Talk\"). The Jester and Minstrel trick the Wizard into telling them of the test and the Jester reminisces about his father's dancing days (\"Very Soft Shoes\").\n\nSir Harry and Lady Larken run into each other and they confess that their love is stronger than ever (\"Yesterday I Loved You\"). When Fred is finally ready for bed, the Queen tries to make her even more sleepy by attempting to hypnotize her with a hypnotic mirror, burning poppy and mandragora incense, forcing her to drink a sleeping draught, and finally bringing in the Nightingale of Samarkand to sing her to sleep (\"Nightingale Lullaby\"), but Winnifred is kept wide awake. It seems that there is some \"lump\" under the mattresses that is keeping her from relaxing. She starts counting sheep.\n\nThe next morning, Dauntless dresses in his finest to see Winnifred pass the test, but the Queen tells him to his great disappointment that the test has already happened and what it was. She says that since Winnifred has not yet emerged from her room, she must still be sleeping and therefore has failed. Dauntless is heartbroken until Winnifred drowsily stumbles into the throne room while still counting sheep; she hasn't slept a wink. Everyone is ecstatic that Winnifred has passed but the Queen insists that Dauntless should not throw himself away on Winnifred.  Dauntless has had enough of his mother's attempts to control his life and finally yells, \"I told you to shut up !\".  The curse on King Sextimus is lifted (the \"mouse\", Dauntless, has metaphorically devoured the \"hawk\", Queen Aggravain). Aggravain discovers that she cannot talk and the King can, so Dauntless and Winnifred are free to be married. The King forces the Queen to hop, skip, and jump around the room to everyone's amusement, and with this, she is forced to step down.\n\nFinally the real reason why Winnifred passed the test is revealed: after learning about the test, the King, Minstrel, and Jester stuffed the mattresses full of weapons, jousting equipment, and other sharp items.  All the items are removed by the Jester in the finale (\"Finale\"). After the items are removed, Winnifred still has trouble sleeping until Dauntless takes the pea out from under the mattresses; she then falls asleep almost immediately, proving that she was indeed a true princess. Everyone, in classic fairy-tale tradition, lives happily ever after.",

        "synopsis": "This synopsis is based on the 2008 UK Tour version.\n\n### Act 1\n\nCamden lad Joe Casey arrives to his house, later joined by his best friends Emmo and Lewis, his girlfriend Sarah, and her best friends Billie and Angie, where a party has been organised by his mother, Kath, for his sixteenth birthday (\"Our House\"). After the party, wanting to impress Sarah, Joe breaks into a building site to show her his street, Casey Street, from above. When the police arrive, Joe convinces Sarah to run away and is left with the decision of whether to run away or give himself up. The story splits into two paths revealed by the ghost of Joe's dead criminal dad: the right path where Joe gives himself up, and the wrong path where he runs away (\"Simple Equation\").\n\nOn the wrong path, Joe escapes the police but is berated by Sarah, and looked down upon by Dad. Joe, Emmo and Lewis drown their sorrows at the pub (\"My Girl\"). When Joe wakes up, he encounters Reecey, the school hardman, who offers Joe an opportunity to leave school and get involved with a \"business idea\" he has (\"Baggy Trousers\"). On the right path, the judge sentences Joe to go to a young offender institution . Joe is subsequently branded an embarrassment by neighbours and family members. Upon his release, Joe tries to get a job, but all of his interviews fail when he reveals that he is a young offender (\"Embarrassment\").\n\nOn the wrong path, Joe accepts Reecey's offer to work for him and they run a scam alarm company. Emmo and Lewis disapprove of Joe and Reecey's business, but are eventually convinced the business is a good idea when they experience some of the perks of Joe's lavish lifestyle (\"Embarrassment \u2013 Reprise (Encouragement Version)\"). On the right path, Joe has gotten a humiliating job wearing a sign pointing to a golf shop. Reecey offers to let Joe borrow one of his stolen cars, which Joe declines but it also gives him an idea; he rents a low quality car which Billie and Angie laugh at but Sarah loves (\"Driving in my Car\"). Sarah thanks Joe and invites him to a charity ball and offers to pay for a dinner jacket. He declines and Sarah is devastated (\"My Girl - Reprise (Ballad Version)\").\n\nOn the wrong path, Joe has started a building business, as well as a limousine business for Emmo and Lewis. Joe, Emmo and Lewis go out for drinks, and their waiter is Sarah, who they have not seen since school. Sarah criticises Joe's selfishness and his decision to run away from the building site when he asks about the charity ball, but confirms that he can come if he wants to. On the right path, Reecey approaches Joe as he walks home from work and convinces him to attempt to burgle a house (\"Simple Equation - Reprise\").\n\nOn the wrong path, Billie, Angie, Sarah, and her new friend Callum are at the charity ball. Joe arrives at the ball with a large donation, and he and Sarah dance (\"The Return of the Los Palmas 7\"). On the right path, Joe and Reecey are caught by the police, and each blames the other for the crime (\"Shut Up\"). Emmo and Lewis call Sarah, who arrives with Callum. The situation escalates, with Joe eventually punching Callum and a policeman. Joe says he wishes he had never met Sarah, causing her to storm off. Joe is sent back to prison. Meanwhile, on the wrong path, Joe and Sarah share a kiss, having rekindled their relationship (\"Tomorrow's (Just Another Day)/The Sun and the Rain\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nOn the wrong path, Joe and Sarah are on a gondola, on their way to get married in Las Vegas (\"Night Boat To Cairo\"). While there, Joe encounters Mr Pressman, who gives Joe his business card. Joe and Sarah get married and a paradise wedding party ensues (\"Wings of a Dove\"). On the right path, Joe is released from prison, but doesn't go home. Kath is worried for him, as she now has two family members who went to prison and never came home (\"One Better Day\"). Mr Pressman meets with Kath to try and convince her to move out of 25 Casey Street so he can build it up; she refuses. Joe overhears Pressman's plans to get rid of number 25, and is now determined to track down Mr Pressman with a new mission: save 25 Casey Street (\"Rise and Fall\").\n\nOn both paths, Joe arrives at Mr Pressman's office (\"House of Fun\"). On the wrong path, Mr Pressman explains to Joe his plan to vacate and build up 25 Casey Street. Joe agrees to get Kath out of the house. On the right path, Joe enters Mr Pressman's office to argue against his plans, but Pressman doesn't pay attention to Joe.\n\nOn the wrong path, while at dinner, Joe reveals his plans to move Kath out of Casey Street and rebuild it as Casey Boulevard. Lewis disagrees with Joe and leaves dinner. Joe looks to Sarah for support, but she also disagrees with him. Joe angrily leaves and Sarah laments on her feelings about Joe, remembering the night he ran away from the police. Meanwhile, Joe tells Mr Pressman he doesn't want to work on Casey Street anymore (\"NW5\"). On the right path, Joe looks for a lawyer, revealed to be Sarah, now engaged to Callum (\"Embarrassment - Reprise (Law Firm)\"). Joe decides he should find a different lawyer and leaves. Sarah realises she misses him and wants him back.\n\nOn the wrong path, Joe is waiting for Mr Pressman's demolition expert, who is revealed to be Reecey. Joe tells Reecey to break into 25 Casey Street while Kath is out (\"Simple Equation \u2013 Reprise\"). On the right path, Sarah finds Joe sleeping in the now disheveled Morris Minor and they discuss Joe's while thinking about how much they miss each other. She reveals that 25 Casey Street was gifted to the Casey family. Joe praises her investigative skills and they hug, more in love than ever (\"It Must Be Love\"). Sarah also reveals she didn't get married. Secretly elated, Joe decides to go home to his mother. On the wrong path, Emmo and Lewis tell Joe that Kath didn't get in the limousine because she wanted to wait for Joe. Realising she'll still be home when Reecey breaks in, Joe runs home (\"The Sun and the Rain\").\n\nOn both paths, Reecey sets fire to 25 Casey Street, and both Joes arrive as the house is burning down. On the right path, Kath is safe, much to the relief of Joe. On the wrong path, Kath dies in the fire. At her funeral, Lewis blames Joe for her death and one by one, the others leave. Joe is charged with arson and manslaughter after Reecey names him as an accomplice.\n\nOn the right path, Joe and Sarah get married. Joe talks with Kath, where he says he now understands his dad's situation better. He says he wishes he'd done things differently, to which his dad says that as long as he's with the people he loves, he's done the right thing. For a brief moment, Joe and Dad can finally hear each other. They share a touching moment as Dad leaves. Joe returns to the group for the wedding photo and the party ensues. Suddenly, Joe is thrust back to the night of the party and eventual break in. However, instead of breaking into the building site, he kisses Sarah before taking her out dancing (\"Our House \u2013 Reprise\").",

        "description": "Passion is a one-act musical , with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and a book by James Lapine . The story is adapted from Ettore Scola 's 1981 film Passione d'Amore , and its source material, Iginio Ugo Tarchetti 's 1869 novel Fosca . Central themes include love, sex, obsession, illness, passion, and the nature of beauty and power. Passion is notable as one of the few projects that Sondheim himself conceived, along with Sweeney Todd and Road Show .\n\nSet in Risorgimento -era Italy, the plot concerns a young soldier and the changes in him brought about by the obsessive love of Fosca, his Colonel's homely, ailing cousin.",
        "synopsis": "The musical is usually presented in one act. An intermission was added only for the London production.\n\n### Act I\n\nIn Milan in 1863, two lovers are at the height of ecstasy (\"Happiness\"). The handsome captain, Giorgio, breaks their reverie by telling Clara that he is being transferred to a provincial military outpost . In the next scene, Giorgio is in the mess hall at the army camp with Colonel Ricci, the unit's commanding officer, and Dr. Tambourri, its physician. He thinks longingly of Clara (\"First Letter\") and she thinks longingly of him (\"Second Letter\"). Giorgio's thoughts are interrupted by a bloodcurdling scream. The Colonel tells him not to worry; it's just Fosca, his sick cousin. Giorgio offers to lend her some of his books.\n\nAs he begins to adjust to the tedium of life at the outpost, the sensitive Giorgio feels increasingly out of place amongst the other men (\"Third Letter\"). He starts becoming friendly with the Doctor, who says Fosca has a nervous disorder. She frequently collapses into seizures, exposing her suffering and need for connection.\n\nFosca arrives after dinner to thank Giorgio for the books. When he suggests she keep a novel longer to meditate over it, she explains that she does not read to think or search for truth, but to live vicariously through the characters. She then darkly muses on her life (\"I Read\"). Giorgio awkwardly changes the subject, but when he observes a hearse pulling up, Fosca has a hysterical convulsion. Giorgio is stunned and appalled (\"Transition\").\n\nThe next afternoon, the Colonel, the Doctor, Giorgio, and Fosca go for a walk together. As they stroll through a castle's neglected garden, Giorgio politely engages Fosca in conversation while mentally narrating a letter to Clara. When Fosca confesses that she feels no hope in her life, he tells her that \"the only happiness that we can be certain of is love.\" Fosca is hurt and embarrassed, but recognizes that Giorgio, like herself, is different from others, and asks for his friendship (\"Garden Sequence\").\n\nGiorgio and Clara exchange letters about Fosca. Clara urges him to avoid her whenever possible. When Giorgio is preparing to take a five-day leave, Fosca shows up unexpectedly, begging him to return soon. Fosca is next seen reading, stone-faced, from a letter Giorgio has sent rejecting her feelings as he and Clara make love (\"Trio\").\n\nUpon Giorgio's return, Fosca reproaches him. She demands to know about his affair and learns that Clara is married. In a sharp exchange, they agree to sever all ties. Weeks go by with no contact between them, but just as he is beginning to think he is finally free of Fosca, Giorgio is informed by the Doctor that she is dying. His rejection of her love has exacerbated her illness. Giorgio, whose job as a soldier is to save lives, must visit her sickbed. He reluctantly agrees.\n\nGiorgio enters Fosca's chamber, and she implores him to lie beside her while she sleeps. At daybreak, Fosca asks him to write her a letter acknowledging the impact that she has made on his soul (\"I Wish I Could Forget You\"). She then tries to kiss him. She is seized by another convulsive attack, and he hastens from the room.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe soldiers gossip about Giorgio and Fosca while playing pool (\"Soldiers' Gossip\"). The Colonel thanks Giorgio for the kindness he has shown Fosca and explains her history. As a child, Fosca's parents doted on her, and she once had illusions about her looks. When she was 17, the Colonel introduced her to an Austrian count , Ludovic. Fosca was taken with him, though she had her reservations. Once they were married, Ludovic took all her family's money. Fosca eventually discovered that he had another wife and a child. When confronted, he admitted his deception and vanished. It was then that Fosca first became ill. After her parents died, she went to live with the Colonel, who felt responsible for her circumstances (\"Flashback\").\n\nMeanwhile, Clara has written Giorgio a letter (\"Sunrise Letter\") in which she describes her fear of losing love when she is old and no longer beautiful. Giorgio makes his way to a desolate mountain and is in the midst of reading when Fosca appears. After Giorgio lashes out at her in anger (\"Is This What You Call Love?\"), she crumples and faints. He picks her up and carries her back in the rain.\n\nThe rain, the ordeal of getting Fosca back to camp, and perhaps exposure to her contagious emotions conspire to give Giorgio a fever. He falls into slumber and dreams that Fosca is dragging him down into the grave (\"Nightmare\"). The Doctor sends him to Milan on sick leave (\"Forty Days\"). As he boards the train, he is followed once again by Fosca. She apologizes for everything and promises to keep her distance for good. Giorgio pleads with her to give him up. She explains that her love is not a choice: it is who she is, and she would gladly die for him (\"Loving You\"). Giorgio is finally moved by the force of her emotion. He takes her back to the outpost (\"Transition\").\n\nThe Doctor warns Giorgio that he must stop seeing Fosca because she threatens his mental and physical health. Giorgio requests to forgo his leave; he feels it his duty to stay and help her as much as he can. In Milan, Clara questions him jealously about Fosca. Giorgio asks Clara to leave her husband and start a new life with him, but she says she cannot because of her son.\n\nAt Christmas, Giorgio is told that he has been transferred to military headquarters. Later, he reads Clara's newest letter, in which she asks him to wait until her son is grown before planning a more serious commitment (\"Farewell Letter\"). Giorgio finds he no longer desires the carefully arranged, convenient affair they shared (\"Just Another Love Story\").\n\nHaving discovered the letter Fosca dictated, the Colonel accuses Giorgio of leading her on and demands a duel. Giorgio insists the letter is sincere. The Doctor attempts to mediate between them, but Giorgio insists on seeing her again. He realizes that he loves Fosca, for no one has ever truly loved him but her. That evening, he returns to Fosca's room, knowing that the physical act might very well kill her (\"No One Has Ever Loved Me\"). They embrace, their passion consummated at last.\n\nThe duel takes place the following morning behind the castle. Giorgio shoots the Colonel and lets out a shrill howl eerily reminiscent of Fosca's earlier outbursts.\n\nMonths later, Giorgio is in a hospital, dazed, recovering from a nervous breakdown. He is told that Fosca died shortly after their night together; the Colonel recovered from the wound. Dreamlike, the other characters in the story reappear as Giorgio begins reading Fosca's last letter. Gradually her voice joins his, and together they look back on their revelations (\"Finale\").\n\nThe company walks off, Fosca last, leaving Giorgio alone at his table.",

In this act, Jason is preparing for his bar mitzvah , while Whizzer is suffering from a life-threatening yet undefined illness, which the audience recognizes is AIDS . It forms the second act of the 1992 Broadway musical Falsettos , with March of the Falsettos as the first act.",
        "synopsis": "The year is 1981. Mendel the psychiatrist shines a flashlight into the audience on a dark stage, welcoming them to \"Falsettoland,\" the conclusion to March of the Falsettos . The cast has been enlarged by two, with Marvin's lesbian neighbors Dr. Charlotte, an internist , and Cordelia, a \" shiksa \" caterer as new additions.  Marvin has realized that it's \"About Time\" that he grows up and gets over himself. He has called a truce with Trina, and he has managed to maintain his relationship with Jason, who is now preparing for his Bar Mitzvah . He has not seen his ex-boyfriend Whizzer for two years and has still not gotten over him.\n\nOne day, when she arrives to take custody of Jason for the week, Trina informs Marvin that it is now time to start planning Jason's Bar Mitzvah. The pair immediately starts bickering, to both Jason's dismay and Mendel's amusement. Mendel encourages them to have a simple party, but Trina (and Cordelia, the caterer) refuse. It is the \"Year of the Child\" after all, the year that every Jewish parent dreams of: the year their child is bar mitzvahed, and they can spend insane amounts of money celebrating.\n\nThe scene moves to Jason's Little League Baseball game. While at bat, Jason has a lot more on his mind than the game. He is trying to decide which girls to invite to his bar mitzvah: the girls he should invite, or the girls he \"wants\" to invite; reaching a discussion in this delicate situation would be a \"Miracle of Judaism.\" Everyone is sitting \"watching Jewish boys who can't play baseball\" and getting a little too into it, when Whizzer suddenly arrives: Jason had asked him to come (\"The Baseball Game\"). Marvin is struck by how little he's aged, and a tentative offer of reconciliation is offered just as Jason miraculously hits the ball due to some batting advice from Whizzer. He's so shocked that he forgets to run.\n\nInterlude: \"A Day in Falsettoland\u201d. In Part One, \"Dr. Mendel at Work,\" Mendel listens to the blather of a yuppie patient and agonizes over being a 1960s shrink stuck in the 1980s, and how his work is taking a toll on his marriage to Trina. In Part Two, \"Trina Works It Out,\" Trina reveals Marvin and Whizzer are back and wonders why that is bothering her. In Part Three, \"The Neighbors Relax,\" Mendel and Trina jog and discuss Marvin and the bar mitzvah, and Dr. Charlotte comes home to Cordelia cooking \"nouvelle bar mitzvah cuisine.\" Cordelia asks Charlotte how her day was at the hospital, and Charlotte exclaims that today was a \"rare day without a death\". Meanwhile, Marvin and Whizzer play racquetball and bicker when Whizzer beats Marvin soundly. All reflect on how wonderful life is.\n\nThe peace doesn't last long. Marvin and Trina are warring over every single aspect of the Bar Mitzvah, which makes Jason want to just call the whole thing off (\"Round Tables, Square Tables\"). It is up to Mendel to console the boy, telling him that \"Everyone Hates His Parents\" at his age, but everyone also gets past it and moves on to hate them less.\n\nMarvin sits in bed one morning, looking at the sleeping Whizzer, wondering how much he loves him (\"What More Can I Say?\"). Dr. Charlotte, meanwhile, has started to become aware that \"Something Bad is Happening\" among young gay men in the city, who arrive at the hospital sick with a mysterious illness that no one seems to know anything about. Rumors spread as the disease begins to spread faster. Then, Whizzer collapses during a game of racquetball (\"More Racquetball\").\n\nAs Whizzer enters the hospital with a disease that the audience immediately knows to be AIDS , Trina begins to see her world fall apart around her as someone she shouldn't care about, but does anyway, is clearly sick. She is barely \"Holding to the Ground\" and this blow to her family may just be too hard to handle.\n\nIn Whizzer's hospital room, the entire cast gathers to cheer him up, everyone commenting on how good he looks. Marvin provides love, Cordelia chicken soup and Mendel some terrible jokes. Everyone agrees that it's \"Days Like This\" that make these secular Jews believe in God. Jason, in a moment of childish honesty, tells Whizzer that he looks awful.\n\nMendel and Trina sit Jason down and give Jason the option of \"Canceling the Bar Mitzvah\" if he feels he can't go through with it, and Jason is finally told that Whizzer may not recover. Marvin sits in Whizzer's hospital room, soon joined by the lesbians, and the four \"Unlikely Lovers\" wonder how much longer their love can last.\n\nAs Whizzer's condition worsens, Jason turns to God, asking him to let Whizzer get better (\"Another Miracle of Judaism\"); he'll even get bar mitzvahed if Whizzer gets better. But it's to no avail, because, as Dr. Charlotte reiterates, \"Something Bad is Happening\" to Whizzer (\"Something Bad Is Happening (reprise)\"). He is soon deathly ill, and he steels himself to meet his maker, reflecting bravely that \"You Gotta Die Sometime.\"\n\nSuddenly, everyone bursts into the hospital room. Jason has had an epiphany: he wants to hold his bar mitzvah in Whizzer's hospital room so he can be there (\"Jason's Bar Mitzvah\"). Trina couldn't be prouder, and everyone, for some reason, can only think how much Jason looks like Marvin. Jason is bar mitzvahed, entering adulthood as Whizzer begins to leave his, for Whizzer is taken out of the room as he can no longer bear to stay.\n\nMarvin is left alone. He sits and reflects on his relationship with Whizzer (\"What Would I Do?\"). Whizzer appears, dressed as we first saw him. The two sing together one last time, and then Whizzer disappears. Marvin is comforted by his family, now short a member, as Mendel bids us goodnight from the crazy, sad world known as \"Falsettoland .\"",

        "synopsis": "In 1772 Frankfurt, Germany , Jews are restricted to living in the ghetto and frequently are the victims of violence (\u201cPleasure and Privilege\u201d). Mayer Amschel Rothschild returns from Hanover , where he was an apprentice banker , to make his fortune in his home town. Because only twelve Jewish marriages are permitted in a given year, he is forced to come up with a plan in order to marry his fianc\u00e9e Gutele (\u201cOne Room\u201d). He reopens his shop, carrying goods and rare coins. At the Frankfurt Fair, he entices Prince William of Hesse with fanciful tales about rare coins (\u201cHe Tossed A Coin\u201d), then bribes the prince in order to marry Gutele. Later, Mayer becomes agent for the court bankers, but he wants more.\n\nBy 1778, Mayer and Gutele have five sons (\u201cSons\u201d), each of whom enters the business as soon as he is old enough. As they age, they and their father chafe at the many restrictions and indignities heaped upon Jews (\u201cEverything\u201d). In 1804, their success and their chutzpah take them to Denmark as superior court agents to the Danish king when Hesse must loan money to him to help fight a war (\u201cRothschilds and Sons\u201d). However, Hesse is overthrown by Napoleon, and Minister of Police Joseph Fouch\u00e9 takes over (\u201cAllons\u201d). When Mayer and his sons return to Germany, they find no court for which they can be agents. Mayer sends his older sons off to collect Hesse's debts before the French can get them, and sends his younger son, Nathan , to London to invest the money (\u201cSons\" (reprise)).\n\nInitially awkward in England, Nathan soon displays considerable investing talents (\u201cThis Amazing London Town\u201d). He falls in love with Hannah Cohen, an aristocratic English \"Jewish Joan of Arc\" devoted to charitable works (\u201cI\u2019m in Love! I\u2019m in Love!\u201d). He eventually wins her over by pledging to loan money to England to help win their war against Napoleon if the Chancellor of the Exchequer Herries pledges to make Germany and Austria lift their restrictions on Jews. In Germany, Prince Metternich promises roughly the same thing if the Rothschilds make the loan (\u201cHave You Ever Seen a Prettier Congress\u201d). In 1818, Metternich reneges on his bargain, and old Mayer dies, broken-hearted (\u201cIn My Lifetime\u201d). His sons scheme to force Metternich to come to terms by continually undercutting his price for peace bonds, although the plan brings them to the brink of bankruptcy (\u201cBonds\u201d). Metternich not only concedes but is forced to guarantee that all state bonds will be handled by the House of Rothschild . The ghetto walls are torn down, and Mayer's dream is realized.",

Additionally, the musical's cast album was nominated for Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nPonyboy Curtis, aged 14, is writing in a notebook, when he begins to introduce the world of the show \u2014 Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1967. He introduces his eldest brother Darrel who used to be a football star with \"a ticket out,\" and his middle brother Sodapop, who recently had his heart broken. He introduces the Greasers, the more gritty, grounded counterparts to the upper-class Socs who \"live like socialites.\" He specifically points out his best friend, Greaser Johnny Cade, who was recently jumped by Socs (\"Tulsa, '67\").\n\nPonyboy is jumped by the same Socs who attacked Johnny, led by their ringleader Bob. When the Socs attempt to cut Ponyboy's hair to make him look like a Soc, Ponyboy bites Bob, and then gets knocked unconscious. He wakes up to his brothers cleaning him up. The other Greasers \u2014 led by Dally, who just got out of county lockup \u2014 tell Ponyboy that he has officially become a Greaser, having gotten through this experience and come out the other end. Darrel worries that Ponyboy is making an irresponsible choice in cementing himself as a Greaser, but Dally makes it official anyway (\"Grease Got a Hold\").\n\nDarrel is at home folding laundry, reflecting on his role as a pseudo-father to his younger brothers after their parents recently died in a car accident, as the rest of the gang make themselves comfortable in the Curtis house (\"Runs in the Family\"). Ponyboy comes home and asks Darrel if he can go to the drive-in with Johnny, Two-Bit, and Dally. Darrel agrees, as long as Ponyboy stays careful and isn't late for curfew, though he's still wary of Dally. Ponyboy and Sodapop discuss how Darrel's in a hard place right now, and Ponyboy asks his brother if, like himself, he dreams about his parents' accident. Sodapop says no, before asking Ponyboy about the book he's reading. Ponyboy and Sodapop reflect on the similarities they each see in the characters in the book \"Great Expectations\" by Charles Dickens. After Sodapop goes to sleep, Ponyboy keeps reading and following this train of thought (\"Great Expectations\").\n\nMeanwhile, Dally finds Johnny outside his house, with sounds of intense arguing from inside. After it becomes clear this has happened before, Johnny tells Dally that he stays at home because he's scared his father will kill his mother. Dally offers to go inside the house himself, but Johnny doesn't let him. Dally gives Johnny a cigarette for warmth, a Hershey Bar, and his switchblade, which he teaches Johnny how to use.\n\nThe next day, Dally, Johnny, and Ponyboy all go to the drive-in, which is full of Socs. There, they meet Sherri \"Cherry\" Valance, who is seeing Bob. (\"Friday at the Drive-in\"). Dally keeps hitting on Cherry, claiming she's \"not as innocent\" as she may seem. Johnny tries to stop him, angering Dallas. Dally continues provoking Cherry, and she throws her coke on him. After Dally leaves, Cherry and her friend Marcia invite Ponyboy and Johnny to sit with them, before eventually asking Ponyboy to escort her to the concession stand. There, the two begin talking and realize that the other isn't exactly as stereotypes led them to believe \u2014 Cherry is dealing with fighting and demanding parents, and Ponyboy likes books and watching the sky change colors as the sun sets (\"I Could Talk to You All Night\").\n\nBob storms in, and he tries to tell Cherry not to talk to Greasers, leading to an altercation between the two groups \u2014 notably between Bob and Two-Bit. Cherry stops them from fighting but breaks up with Bob in doing so. Bob \u2014 who is clearly drunk \u2014 threatens Ponyboy. Cherry tells Ponyboy not to take it the wrong way if she doesn't say hello to him at school. Ponyboy and Johnny arrive at the Curtis home, late for curfew. An enraged Darrel begins shouting at his younger brother, and Ponyboy fights back. Sodapop is unable to quell the argument. As tensions escalate, Darrel slaps Ponyboy (\"Runs in the Family\" (reprise)). Ponyboy and Johnny run away. They sit and contemplate what could be next for them, dreaming of running far away (\"Far Away From Tulsa\").\n\nPonyboy and Johnny are stopped by the Socs, led by Bob. A fight breaks out, and it escalates quickly. The Socs attempt to drown Ponyboy in a water fountain, but before they can finish the job, Johnny stabs Bob with the blade Dally gave him, killing the Soc. By the time Ponyboy regains consciousness, the other Socs have fled. Ponyboy and Johnny run to Buck Merril's Bar searching for Dallas, who gives them money and directions to an abandoned church where they can hide for the time being. Ponyboy and Johnny do as they're told (\"Run Run Brother\").\n\n### Act II\n\nIn Tulsa, the Socs and police are searching for Ponyboy and Johnny, who the Socs told the police were responsible for Bob's death. Darrel and Sodapop are interrogated about what they know or who they know that might know more, with the police singling out Dally as a specific person of interest, though they receive no information from him. At the abandoned church, Ponyboy and Johnny see their photographs in the newspaper and decide that Ponyboy needs to cut and bleach his hair to make him less recognizable.  Cherry struggles with the death of her boyfriend while acknowledging that he was not a good person. Paul mourns with Cherry before accusing her of antagonizing Bob into fighting Ponyboy. Paul and the Socs then declare war on the Greasers, beating up Two-Bit as a \"message\", and plan a fight for next Saturday night at the same park where Bob was killed. (\"Justice for Tulsa\").\n\nAt the church, Ponyboy reflects on how he feels that he brings death and bad luck to others and that Johnny should just leave him at the church and run away on his own. Johnny refuses, saying he will stick by Ponyboy no matter what. (\"Death's at My Door\"). Meanwhile, at the Curtis house, Dally tells Darrel and Sodapop that no one will find Ponyboy and Johnny, but Darrel blames Dally for being a bad influence on the two boys. Dally counters that he spends more time with Ponyboy than Darrel does. He prepares to strike Darrel, but Sodapop stops the fighting before it can escalate further. Dally backs off but walks away in anger. Darrel worries that he will never be able to help Ponyboy, and contemplates giving up. Sodapop reminds him that they don't give up on family. Ponyboy reflects on this from the church, on his own (\"Throwing in the Towel\").\n\nPonyboy recites a poem \"Nothing Gold Can Stay\" by Robert Frost to Johnny, as they watch the sunrise. Dally arrives at the church, and tells Ponyboy and Johnny that there are kids at the church having a field trip or picnic of some kind. He gives Ponyboy a letter from Sodapop about how the house isn't complete without Ponyboy. Darrel is seen on stage, representing his concern and love for Ponyboy as well. (\"Soda's Letter\"). Johnny decides he wants to return to Tulsa and turn himself in. Dally is adamant that this is a bad idea, telling the boys that it's always better to run away from trouble like he has. He also reveals that the Socs and Greasers' rivalry has only worsened and that there will soon be a rumble. The winner gets control over the park. During this conversation, Ponyboy throws a cigarette on the ground behind him.\n\nDally tells Ponyboy and Johnny that he is going to drive them to Iowa where someone is going to take them in. But before they can leave, the church catches on fire from the cigarette Ponyboy threw away. Ponyboy and Johnny run into the flames to rescue the kids Dally had mentioned earlier, turning them into local heroes back in Tulsa \u2014 where they return (\"Hoods Turned Heroes\"). Ponyboy ends up not badly injured, but a beam falls on Johnny's back, and he can no longer feel his legs. Dally says he will not be holding back at the rumble. Cherry comes to the hospital room and tells Ponyboy that she cleared him and Johnny of all murder charges by giving a statement to the police. She begs Ponyboy to not fight in the upcoming rumble (\"Hopeless War\").\n\nNevertheless, Ponyboy feels he has to fight for Johnny, and joins the Greasers in preparing for the rumble. Darrel shows up, ready to fight, and asks Ponyboy to let him fight on his behalf. Ponyboy still refuses, and all three Curtis brothers prepare to fight in the rumble (\"Trouble\"). Darrel and Paul \u2014 once best friends, now rivals \u2014 start fighting one-on-one, before everyone breaks out into an all-out fight. The Greasers and Socs brutally fight one another in the pouring rain, and eventually, the Greasers win. They go visit Johnny in the hospital after the fight. Johnny tells Ponyboy to \"stay gold,\" and then dies. All the Greasers become emotional. Overwhelmed with grief, Dally storms out of the hospital. He runs to the train tracks and lets himself get hit by an oncoming train, killing him (\"Little Brother\").\n\nPonyboy is distraught, not speaking, and staring at the television while his brothers try to help him. They reveal he's been like that for two weeks. Darrel acknowledges that although Johnny and Dally are both heroes, they are both gone. A stunned and enraged Ponyboy pins Darrel to the ground, but Sodapop tearfully stops them, fed up with the constant fighting, reminding them that they only have each other and have to look out for each other. Cherry then stops by, revealing she started volunteering at the hospital. She found a pile of Johnny's clothes and thought Ponyboy should have them. She tells Ponyboy that Johnny left a note for him in one of his pockets. The note \u2014 which Sodapop reads to Ponyboy, as Ponyboy is too emotional to even open it \u2014 reveals that Johnny had time to think before he died, and that he understands the meaning of \"Nothing Gold Can Stay\" \u2014 which neither of them understood when Ponyboy first recited it at the church. He again tells Ponyboy to \"stay gold,\" and asks him to remind Dally of the good in the world (\"Stay Gold\").\n\nPonyboy tells Darrel and Sodapop that while he loves being a Greaser, that's not all there is to him, which both of his brothers accept. Ponyboy sits down to eat dinner with the two of them. Sodapop asks him about what he was writing in his notebook, and Ponyboy reveals that it's a story of the events that have happened throughout. Eventually, Darrel and Soda read it out loud, revealing it to be the opening narration to \"The Outsiders\" novel (Finale (\"Tulsa '67\")).",

It won two awards: Best Scenic Design for Mimi Lien and Best Lighting Design in a Musical for Bradley King .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe musical starts in 1812, Moscow, Russia, by introducing the characters (\"Prologue\"). The audience is then introduced to Pierre Bezukhov, a depressed, unhappily married man who feels he is wasting his life (\"Pierre\"). He is a good friend of Andrey Bolkonsky, who is away fighting in the war. Andrey has recently become engaged to Natasha Rostova. Natasha and her cousin, Sonya Rostova, arrive in Moscow to visit Natasha's godmother, Marya Dmitrievna, and wait for Andrey to come home (\"Moscow\"). Natasha is to meet her future in-laws, Andrey's sister, the lonely Mary Bolkonskaya, and his father, the old Prince Bolkonsky, who are trapped in a hateful co-existence (\"The Private and Intimate Life of the House\"). However, their meeting ends in disaster, as Natasha finds Mary cold and Mary finds Natasha vain, with Bolkonsky behaving bizarrely and dismissing Natasha (\"Natasha And Bolkonskys\"). Natasha leaves, missing Andrey more than ever, and recalls the time they first met (\"No One Else\").\n\nThe next night, Natasha watches an opera with Sonya and Marya. Natasha catches the eye of Pierre's brother-in-law Anatole Kuragin, a notorious rogue and womaniser (\"The Opera\"). Anatole visits Natasha in her box to flirt and leaves her with feelings she has never experienced before (\"Natasha And Anatole\").\n\nAnatole arrives home after the opera and goes out drinking with his friend, Fedya Dolokhov, and Pierre. They are met by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bezukhova, the unfaithfully promiscuous wife of Pierre and shamelessly suggestive sister of Anatole. Anatole lusts for Natasha, although it is revealed he is already married. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne flirts with Dolokhov, who taunts Pierre by raising a toast to \"married women and their lovers\". A drunk Pierre finds Dolokhov's behaviour insulting and challenges him to a duel. Pierre accidentally wounds Dolokhov, and Dolokhov, despite being a renowned crack shot, miraculously misses him. Before they all leave, Anatole asks H\u00e9l\u00e8ne to invite Natasha to a ball that evening, and she agrees (\"The Duel\"). They leave Pierre, who reflects on his near-death experience and realizes that despite wasting his life, he wishes to live and find love (\"Dust And Ashes\").\n\nThe next morning, as Natasha prepares for church, she is confused about her feelings for Anatole at the opera and questions whether they mean she has betrayed Andrey, fearing that something may prevent them from being together (\"Sunday Morning\"). Later that day, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne visits Natasha and invites her to the ball, praising her beauty, and Natasha agrees to attend. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne privately revels in the scandalous idea of her brother and Natasha getting together (\"Charming\").\n\nThat night at the ball, Natasha is met by Anatole, and they dance. Anatole professes his love to Natasha, who tries to tell him that she is already engaged. Ignoring this, Anatole kisses Natasha, leading her to fall in love with him in return (\"The Ball\").\n\n### Act II\n\nAfter his duel with Dolokhov, Pierre begins studying to search for enlightenment. Natasha is further torn between her feelings for both Andrey and Anatole (\"Letters\"). Sonya discovers letters between Natasha and Anatole, learning of their relationship. She confronts Natasha and desperately explains her distrust of Anatole, but Natasha bursts out in anger at her and leaves. Natasha writes to Mary and breaks off her engagement with Andrey (\"Sonya And Natasha\"). Alone, Sonya reflects on her love for her cousin and her determination to save her, even if it means losing her closest friend (\"Sonya Alone\").\n\nThat evening, Anatole and Dolokhov prepare for an elopement between Anatole and Natasha. Dolokhov attempts to change Anatole's mind, but is unsuccessful (\"Preparations\"). Balaga, their troika driver, arrives to take them to Natasha's house, where they will retrieve her before departing (\"Balaga\"). When they arrive at Natasha's house, citizens of Moscow are there to bid their goodbyes to Anatole and Natasha, but are thwarted at the last moment by Marya (\"The Abduction\").\n\nMarya scolds Natasha, who then reveals to Marya and Sonya that she broke off her engagement with Andrey and reaffirms her love for Anatole, whom she still believes is unmarried. Natasha screams at Marya and Sonya, bursting into tears as she waits all night for Anatole (\"In My House\"). Marya calls on Pierre in the middle of the night and explains the situation to him, begging him to handle the crisis. Pierre tells Marya that Anatole is already married (\"A Call to Pierre\"). Pierre, outraged, searches Moscow for Anatole while Marya and Sonya tell a grief-stricken Natasha that Anatole is already married. Pierre eventually finds Anatole at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's house (\"Find Anatole\"). Pierre, close to violence, orders Anatole to leave Moscow and burn all his correspondence with Natasha. A terrified Anatole agrees, but manages to squeeze travelling money out of Pierre in the process (\"Pierre And Anatole\"). Natasha attempts to take her own life by poisoning herself with arsenic, but lives (\"Natasha Very Ill\").\n\nThe next day, Andrey returns home from the war and is disoriented about the refusal of marriage he received from Natasha, which he asks Pierre about. Pierre explains the scandal to him and pleads with him to be compassionate, but Andrey is unable to forgive Natasha and cold-heartedly tells Pierre that he will not ask for her hand in marriage again (\"Pierre And Andrey\"). Pierre visits a shattered Natasha, meeting her for the first time, and comforts her. During their conversation, he expresses that if he were the best man on Earth and were free, he would gladly marry her, giving her hope (\"Pierre And Natasha\"). After their meeting, Pierre experiences a moment of enlightenment as he watches the Great Comet of 1812 soar across the night sky (\"The Great Comet Of 1812\").",

Here Come Those High-Steppin' Strutters!\"  In conjunction with all the festivities, there was significant national press attention commemorating the anniversary.\n\nAfter 41 previews, the Broadway production, directed by Walter Bobbie and choreographed by Pamela Sousa , with vocal arrangements by Fred Wells and orchestrations by Michael Gibson and Jonathan Tunick , opened on November 17, 1993, at the Criterion Center Stage Right , where it ran for 52 performances. Victoria Clark , Jason Graae , Alyson Reed , Martin Vidnovic , and Lynne Wintersteller comprised the cast. Martin Vidnovic was replaced by Gregg Edelman on the cast recording and some later performances.\n\nThe Broadway engagement was nominated for two Tony Awards :  Best Musical and Best Book of a Musical.  It is the only production in Broadway history to be nominated for Best Book of a Musical that has no script - there are no spoken words.  It is also the only revue in history to be nominated for Best Book of a Musical since revues are generally not eligible for awards that require a narrative framework.  So, the nomination for Best Book of a Musical was in recognition of the sequence of songs.  The show was also nominated for the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revue.\n\nAn original cast archival recording of the Rainbow & Stars production is available at www.AGrandNightForSinging.com .  An original cast recording of the Broadway version was released by Var\u00e8se Sarabande .",

        "description": "Pennies from Heaven is a 1981 American musical romantic drama film directed by Herbert Ross , based on the 1978 BBC television drama . Dennis Potter adapted his screenplay from the BBC series for American audiences, changing its setting from London and the Forest of Dean to Depression-era Chicago and rural Illinois .\n\nThe film stars Steve Martin , Bernadette Peters , Christopher Walken and Jessica Harper . Choreographed by Danny Daniels , the film includes musical numbers consisting of actors lip-syncing and dancing to popular songs of the 1920s\u201330s, such as \" Let's Misbehave \", \" Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries \", \" Let's Face the Music and Dance \" and the title song .\n\nWhile positively received by critics, it was a box office bomb , grossing just a fraction of its budget. It received 3 nominations at the 54th Academy Awards , but didn't win any of them.",
        "synopsis": "In 1934, Chicago sheet-music salesman Arthur Parker is going through hard times. His business is failing, and his wife Joan refuses to give him the money she inherited from her father to start his own business.\n\nArthur's dream is to live in a world that is like the songs he tries to sell. He is refused a bank loan, although he fantasizes that he gets it. In his travels, Arthur meets schoolteacher Eileen Everson and falls in love with her instantly. They embark on a short affair, but Arthur leaves her and returns to Joan, who is desperate to keep him and agrees to give him the money he wanted. Arthur denies having an affair, though Joan is sure he is lying.\n\nEileen gets pregnant by Arthur and is fired. With nowhere to go, she takes up with stylish pimp Tom. Eileen is attracted to Tom's \"badness\", and he arranges for her to have an abortion.\n\nWhen Arthur meets Eileen again, she is now a prostitute calling herself \"Lulu\". They resume their romance, and Eileen leaves Tom and her sordid life. Impulsively, Arthur convinces her to run away with him. Having failed to sell his business, Arthur and Eileen break into the store one night and trash it, smashing its phonograph records (except for \" Pennies from Heaven \"). To supplement their income, Eileen keeps prostituting in spite of Arthur's objections.\n\nA blind girl whom Arthur knew superficially is raped and murdered by an accordion-playing hobo to whom Arthur had once given a ride. The police suspect Arthur, and Joan tells them that he has sordid sexual proclivities to get back at him for cheating on her. The police find Arthur trying to leave town with Eileen, and arrest him for murder; he is soon convicted and sentenced to death. At the gallows, he recites the lyrics from the song \"Pennies from Heaven\". In one final fantasy, Arthur and Eileen are reunited, with Arthur saying, \"We couldn't have gone through all that without a happy ending. Songs ain't like that, are they?\"",

        "description": "Show Boat is a musical with music by Jerome Kern and book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II . It is based on Edna Ferber 's best-selling 1926 novel of the same name . The musical follows the lives of the performers, stagehands and dock workers on the Cotton Blossom , a Mississippi River show boat , over 40 years from 1887 to 1927. Its themes include racial prejudice and tragic, enduring love. The musical contributed such classic songs as \" Ol' Man River \", \" Make Believe \", and \" Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man \".\n\nThe musical was first produced in 1927 by Florenz Ziegfeld . The premiere of Show Boat on Broadway was an important event in the history of American musical theatre. It \"was a radical departure in musical storytelling, marrying spectacle with seriousness\", compared with the trivial and unrealistic operettas , light musical comedies and \"Follies\"-type musical revues that defined Broadway in the 1890s and early 20th century. According to The Complete Book of Light Opera :\n\nThe quality of Show Boat was recognized immediately by critics, and it is frequently revived. Awards did not exist for Broadway shows in 1927, when the show premiered, nor in 1932 when its first revival was staged. Late 20th-century revivals of Show Boat have won both the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical (1995) and the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival (1991).",
        "synopsis": "In 1887, the show boat Cotton Blossom arrives at the river dock in Natchez, Mississippi . The Reconstruction era had ended a decade earlier, and white-dominated Southern legislatures have imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow rules. The boat's owner, Cap'n Andy Hawks, introduces his actors to the crowd on the levee. A fistfight breaks out between Steve Baker, the leading man of the troupe, and Pete, a rough engineer who had been making passes at Steve's wife, the leading lady Julie La Verne . Steve knocks Pete down, and Pete swears revenge, suggesting he knows a dark secret about Julie. Cap'n Andy pretends to the shocked crowd that the fight was a preview of one of the melodramas to be performed. The troupe exits with the showboat band, and the crowd follows.\n\nA handsome riverboat gambler, Gaylord Ravenal , appears on the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia (\"Nolie\") Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap'n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (\"Parthy\"). Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal (\" Make Believe \"). She seeks advice from Joe, a Black dock worker aboard the boat, who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie, the ship's cook. He replies that he has \"seen a lot like [Ravenal] on the river.\" As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice. He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of \" Ol' Man River \", who does not seem to care what the world's troubles are, but \"jes' keeps rollin' along\". Magnolia finds Julie inside and announces that she is in love. Julie cautions her that this stranger could be just a \"no-account river feller\". Magnolia says that if she found out he was \"no-account\", she would stop loving him. Julie warns her that it is not that easy to stop loving someone, explaining that she will always love Steve and singing a few lines of \" Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man \". Queenie overhears \u2013 she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard \"colored folks\" sing it. Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time, and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song, Julie obliges.\n\nDuring the rehearsal for that evening, Julie and Steve learn that the town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists the show cannot proceed because Julie is a mulatto who has been passing as white and local law prohibits mixed marriages . Julie admits that her mother was Black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has \"black blood\" in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as Black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.\n\nRavenal returns and asks for passage on the boat. Andy hires him as the new leading man and assigns his daughter Magnolia as the new leading lady, over her mother's objections. As Magnolia and Ravenal begin to rehearse their roles and in the process, kiss for the first time (infuriating Parthy), Joe reprises the last few lines of \"Ol' Man River\". Weeks later, Magnolia and Ravenal have been a hit with the crowds and have fallen in love. As the levee workers hum \"Ol' Man River\" in the background, he proposes to Magnolia, and she accepts. The couple joyously sings \" You Are Love \". They make plans to marry the next day while Parthy, who disapproves, is out of town. Parthy has discovered that Ravenal once killed a man and arrives with the sheriff to interrupt the wedding festivities. The group learns that Ravenal was acquitted of murder. Cap'n Andy calls Parthy \"narrow-minded\" and defends Ravenal by announcing that he also once killed a man. Parthy faints, but the ceremony proceeds.\n\nSix years have passed, and it is 1893. Ravenal and Magnolia have moved to Chicago , where they make a precarious living from Ravenal's gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life (\"Why Do I Love You?\") By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Ravenal abandons Magnolia and Kim, but first visits his daughter at the convent where she goes to school to say goodbye before leaving her forever (\"Make Believe\" (reprise)). Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they are doing a New Year's show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after being abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song \" Bill \". She appears to be thinking of Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing room, she hears Magnolia singing \"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man\" for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, Andy and Parthy go to Chicago for a surprise visit to their daughter Magnolia. Andy goes to the Trocadero without his wife, and sees Magnolia overcome with emotion and nearly booed off stage. Andy rallies the crowd by starting a sing-along of the standard, \" After the Ball \". Magnolia becomes a great musical star.\n\nMore than 20 years pass, and it is 1927. An aged Joe on the Cotton Blossom sings a reprise of \"Ol' Man River\". Cap'n Andy has a chance meeting with Ravenal and arranges his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the Cotton Blossom with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, Charleston version of \"Why Do I Love You?\" Ravenal sings a reprise of \"You Are Love\" to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple walks up the boat's gangplank, Joe and the cast sing the last verse of \"Ol' Man River\".\n\nThe 1951 MGM film changed the final scenes of the story, as well as many small details. It reconciles Ravenal and Magnolia a few years after they separate, rather than 23 years later. When Ravenal leaves Magnolia in Chicago, he does not know that she is pregnant. Through a chance meeting with Julie, he learns that Magnolia and his daughter are living on the Cotton Blossom. He goes to where the boat is docked and sees Kim playing. He talks with her; the two \"make believe\" that he is her \"real daddy\", and he weeps. Magnolia arrives and sends Kim aboard. She and Ravenal hesitate and then embrace, and she leads him onto the boat. Parthy is as happy as Captain Andy to see the reunion. Joe and the chorus sing \"Ol' Man River\", and the ship heads downriver. Julie watches from a distance and blows them a gentle kiss as the Cotton Blossom recedes.",

Bob Fosse , who directed the original Broadway production, also contributed to the libretto. The musical uses the premise of a mysterious performance troupe, led by the Leading Player, to tell the story of Pippin , a young prince on his search for meaning and significance.  The fourth wall is broken numerous times during most traditional productions.\n\nThe protagonist, Pippin, and his father, Charlemagne , are characters derived from two historical figures of the early Middle Ages , though the plot is fictional and presents no historical accuracy regarding either.  The show was partially financed by Motown Records . As of December 2025, the original run of Pippin is the 40th longest-running Broadway show .\n\nBen Vereen and Patina Miller won Tony Awards for their portrayals of the Leading Player in the original Broadway production and the 2013 revival, respectively, making them the first actors to win Tonys for Best Leading Actor and Best Leading Actress in a Musical, for the same role.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nThis musical begins with the Leading Player of a traveling performance troupe and the accompanying Players inviting the audience to witness their show, breaking the fourth wall (\"Magic to Do\"). They begin telling the story of Pippin (who they say is being portrayed by a new actor making his stage debut), the first son of King Charlemagne . Addressing the Players as if they are the professors at his college graduation, Pippin sings of his wish for fulfillment, believing he must find his purpose in life (\"Corner of the Sky\"). Pippin returns home to the castle and estate of his father. Charlemagne and Pippin don't get a chance to communicate often, as they are constantly interrupted by nobles, soldiers, and courtiers vying for Charlemagne's attention (\"Welcome Home\"). Pippin also meets with his ambitious stepmother Fastrada , and her dim-witted son Lewis . Charlemagne and Lewis are planning on going into battle against the Visigoths soon, and Pippin begs his father to take him along as a soldier to prove himself. Charlemagne reluctantly agrees and proceeds to explain the battle plan to his men (\"War is a Science\"), interrupted repeatedly by an over-enthusiastic Pippin.\n\nThe Players express the battle through song and dance, with the Leading Player and two lead dancers in the middle (performing Bob Fosse 's famous \"Manson Trio\") whilst depictions of violence and dismemberment occur behind them (\"Glory\"). Charlemagne declares victory, and leads his army off to the next battle, eager for more glory. A disillusioned Pippin has a cynical discussion with the severed head of an enemy soldier, recognizing the futility of battle. He flees to the countryside as the Leading Player sings of the pleasures of a free and easy life (\"Simple Joys\"). There, Berthe , his paternal grandmother, exiled by Fastrada, tells Pippin to stop worrying about his future, and rather to enjoy the pleasures and comforts of the present (\"No Time at All\"). Pippin takes this advice to heart and searches for more lighthearted pastimes. He begins to enjoy many meaningless sexual encounters, but it soon becomes overwhelming and Pippin forces all the women away (\"With You\"), discovering that relationships without love leave you feeling \"empty and vacant\".\n\nThe Leading Player enters and talks with the now exhausted Pippin, suggesting that fulfillment can be found in fighting against his father's tyrannical ways. He agrees, and becomes the leader of a revolution against his father. Fastrada learns of Pippin's plan, and she takes advantage of it by devising a plan of her own\u2014 if Pippin either successfully kills Charlemagne, or fails and is arrested for treason, Lewis will be next in line for the throne either way. She manipulates Charlemagne into going to his annual prayer early, and she tells Pippin that he will be at the chapel unarmed (\"Spread a Little Sunshine\"). At the royal chapel at Arles , Pippin confronts his father, who justifies his cruelty and tyranny as being necessary tools to achieve peace and prosperity for the realm. He dismissively tells Pippin to do what he must. Pippin assassinates his father, and the people bow to their new king, rejoicing that the tyranny has come to an end (\" Morning Glow \"). The Leading Player mentions to the audience that they will break for now, but to expect a thoroughly thrilling finale.\n\n### Act 2\n\nAs king, Pippin brings peace to the land by giving to the poor, eradicating taxes, ending the military, and peacefully settling foreign disputes. However, this soon falls apart, as Pippin is forced to go back on many of his promises, reverting to the tyrannical ways of his father. At Pippin's request, the Leading Player revives Charlemagne, who takes the throne back, and Pippin is left discouraged, as his life is still unfulfilled. The Leading Player counsels him to keep going down his life's path (\"On the Right Track\"), but after experimenting with art and religion, Pippin falls into monumental despair and collapses on the floor.\n\nWidowed farm-owner Catherine finds him on the street and is attracted by the arch of his foot (\"And There He Was\"), and when Pippin comes to, she introduces herself (\"Kind of Woman\"). From the start, it is clear that the Leading Player is concerned with Catherine's acting ability and actual attraction to Pippin \u2014 after all, she is but a player playing a part in the Leading Player's yet-to-be-unfolded plan. Catherine has Pippin help as a farmhand on her estate. At first, Pippin thinks himself above such things (\"Extraordinary\"), but after comforting her son, Theo, on the sickness and eventual death of his pet duck (\"Prayer for a Duck\"), he warms up to Catherine and finds himself attracted to her (\"Love Song\"). However, as time goes by, Pippin realizes he's grown too comfortable in monotony, and leaves the estate to continue searching for his true purpose. Catherine is heartbroken and reflects on him, spontaneously beginning a song that was not initially in the script, much to the Leading Player's anger and surprise (\" I Guess I'll Miss the Man \").\n\nAll alone on a stage, Pippin is surrounded by the Leading Player and the various Players. They tell him that the only fulfilling thing is their one perfect act, the Finale, in which Pippin will light himself on fire and \"become one with the flame\", implying that he will die in the process. They compare him to the sun, convincing him to sacrifice his life for one burst of glory. Just when he is about to do it, he realizes that there has to be something other than death and chooses not to follow through. Catherine and Theo enter, defying the script, and stand beside Pippin. He sings to her, realizing that his purpose was never in magic or spectacle, but rather to live an ordinary life (\"Finale\"/\"Magic Shows and Miracles\"). The furious Leading Player throws a fit, calling off the show and telling the rest of the Players and the orchestra to pack up, leaving Pippin, Catherine, and Theo alone on the empty stage without sets, lights or costumes. Alone and abandoned by the troupe, Catherine asks Pippin how he feels. Pippin answers, \"Trapped...but happy\u2014which isn't too bad for the end of a musical comedy.\"\n\n### Extended ending\n\nThe \"Theo ending\" was originally conceived in 1998 by Mitch Sebastian, and is included in all newer productions of Pippin , including the 2013 Broadway revival. After the Players shun Pippin for not performing the grand finale, and he avers his contentment with a simple life with Catherine, Theo remains alone on stage and sings a verse of \"Corner of the Sky\", after which the Leading Player and the Players return, backed by the \"Magic to Do\" melody, implying that the existential crisis at the heart of the play is part of a cycle and will now continue, but with Theo as the Players' replacement for Pippin. Current productions vary between the two possible endings, though Schwartz himself has expressed his preference for the newer ending. This is also the ending used in most licensed versions of the musical.\n\nNotes",

        "synopsis": "Four high school friends meet one night, a year after graduation, on the high school football field's bleachers.  Will introduces the background of the four friends (\"My Three Best Friends\"). Will has invited the three of his friends, Andy (Will's college roommate), Skip (who went to an Ivy league school), and Jack (similarly separated from Will, Andy, and Skip, though where is not specified) to meet with him.  As the friends arrive (\"Are You Ready For Tonight?\"), Will begins to catch up with his friends and in the process gets caught up in a traditional match of male-bonding/one-upsmanship with Andy over their College sexual exploits (\"We've Got Girls\"). Will also mentions the purpose of the midnight meeting: to play a prank on the friends' high school rivals/oppressors/classmates, and though all four are not right off the bat on board for the prank Will manages to convince them (\"Right Here\").\n\nThe first plot twist arrives when Jack reveals that he is gay (\"Open Road\"), after which Andy privately airs his misgivings and his feelings of betrayal to Will (\"Things Are Different\"), whereat Will convinces Andy to stay despite how uncomfortable Andy is being around Jack. Skip proceeds to expound on his recent intuitions about life and the generation to which the four friends belong (\"Generation Apathy\"). After hearing about how his friends have changed, Will sits back and reflects on the difference between the reality of the get together and what he assumed it would be like (\"After All\"). After reading Will's Journal, the four friends compare notes about high school and recount the \"glory days\" of the past (\"The Good Old Glory Type Days\"). Jack then takes Will aside to ask him about what he thinks about Jack's revelation, and asks Will what Will thinks Andy thinks, where Will betrays Andy's confidence and half-lies to Jack to cushion the blow of Andy's misgivings, going on to \"explain\" Andy to Jack (\"The Thing About Andy\").\n\nFurther complications arise in the direct aftermath of Will and Jack's conference when Jack expresses some feelings for Will whereupon he and Will are caught by Andy and Skip. An altercation brews when Andy interprets this as a further betrayal and explodes at Will, who is then defended by Jack (who unintentionally validates Andy's assumption). The argument grows more heated and more confusing as Skip leaps to Jack's defense and Will attempts to make peace between the four friends (\"Forget About It\"). During the argument Andy throws an angry epithet at Will, and Jack and Andy then vent their mutual feelings of betrayal and anger at a new level of emotional violence (\"Other Human Beings\") after which Jack departs. Skip then turns on Andy, who vents his ire, exposes the lies Will had told, and demands his due from the two remaining friends (\"My Turn\"), after which Andy storms off. Learning what truly happened from Will, Skip then talks Will into accepting his mistakes (\"Boys\"), and Skip leaves Will alone on the field. Will reexamines his life and decides to stop living in the past and move forward like his friends have (\"My Next Story\").",

It is based on the 1933 , 1976 and 2005 films. The original production was mounted in Australia in 2013. A re-worked Broadway production premiered in October 2018.",
        "synopsis": "### Melbourne\n\nIn the middle of The Great Depression in New York City, film director Carl Denham is pressured to find a leading lady for his next film (\"Hunting Season\"). He searches the city for a woman fitting for the role but with little success (\"Sweethearts on Parade/Brother Can You Spare a Dime\"). Meanwhile, Ann Darrow is also struggling to cope with life in the city (\"What's It Gonna Take\"). She is robbed by thugs who taunt her by tossing around her belongings (\" I Wanna Be Loved by You \"). Denham spots her and realises she is perfect for the role. Ann is almost arrested for trying to steal an apple but Denham is able to prevent it. He offers her a job to star in his picture which she reluctantly accepts. Ann boards his ship and meets the crew including Jack Driscoll with whom she does not get along at first. The ship leaves the port as Denham thinks about how successful his new film will be (\"Colossus\"). The next morning Ann is nervous about her screen test but later becomes confident as she gets ready (\"Special FX\"). She and Jack get to know each other a little better (\"Perfect') and eventually fall in love (\"Foxtrot\").\n\nThe ship eventually arrives at Skull Island, the crew argue about whether to turn back or explore the island but Denham insists they go ashore. They interrupt the natives' sacrificial ritual and a fight breaks out (\"Ritual\"). The crew head back to the ship but Ann is abducted and offered as a sacrifice to Kong (\"Ascent\"). The crew go to rescue her but are too late as Kong has already taken her. Jack, however is determined to get Ann back and ventures into the jungle (\"In the Face of Forever\"). Meanwhile, Ann wakes up to face Kong in his cave. At first she is frightened but she builds the courage to stand up to him. Kong protects her when she is almost attacked by a giant snake and they form a special bond (\"Full Moon Lullaby\"). While Kong falls asleep, Jack quietly approaches and Ann reluctantly goes back with him. Kong suddenly wakes and realizes Ann is gone and chases after them (\"The Chase\"). Denham and the crew capture Kong using gas bombs to knock him out and Ann as bait, much to her dismay. Denham decides to present Kong to the public in New York.\n\nNow back in New York, Ann contemplates her experiences on Skull Island (\"What's It Gonna Take\") while Denham advertises for his show in which he intends to present a now captive Kong to the audience (\"The Greatest Show on Earth\"). Jack proposes to Ann and she accepts (\"Dance with Me\"). The couple are about to enter the theatre when Ann asks for a moment alone before joining him as she is caught between starting a new life with Jack and her affection and sympathy for Kong (\"A Simple Prayer\"). Denham presents Kong in chains to the audience much to their astonishment. Ann and Jack rush onto the stage causing Denham to panic as he is worried they will try to turn the public against him. Ann tries to console Kong but when Denham orders the guards to remove her, despite Jack warning them not to touch her, Kong believes they are trying to hurt her and breaks free as Jack quickly escapes with Ann. Denham sends out the Avalanches to entertain and calm down the nervous crowd (\" Get Happy \").\n\nKong rampages through the city in search of Ann and kills few look-alikes, but Ann manages to find him and calm him down. He gently picks her up and takes her to the top of the Empire State Building as the public watch in awe. Denham is arrested despite his protests \"It was beauty killed the beast! Not me!\" (\"Rise\"). Atop, Ann and Kong share a moment (\"Full Moon Lullaby (Reprise)\") but it is cut short when airplanes begin to shoot at Kong. Ann desperately yells for them stop but they don't hear her. Kong is fatally shot in the neck and falls to his death (\"Amen, Opus 35\"). Below, Jack reunites with a devastated Ann while the crowd gather around to see Kong's dead body.\n\n### Broadway\n\nAnn Darrow, a girl from the countryside, comes to New York City to seek out her dream of being on Broadway (\"Prologue\"). She auditions for a show but does not make the cut (\"Dance My Way to the Light\"). Undaunted by the rejection, she tries to audition for a plethora of jobs (\"Queen of New York\"). After taking refuge in a diner to escape the cold New York streets, Ann meets a man named Carl Denham. Due to Denham's quick thinking, Ann is saved from being kicked out of the diner, and he reveals he is a director wanting a leading lady for a new movie, the details of which are kept secret, aside from the fact that the filming location is accessible only by boat. He promises Ann that if she takes the job, he'll make her a star. Ann agrees, and the two set off to the S.S. Wander, helmed by Captain Leviticus Englehorn and his crew (\"Building the Boat\").\n\nDenham quickly gives introductions as Englehorn comments on the fact that they're being trailed by another boat, Denham trying to ignore it. He tells an extremely wary Ann that the ship is loaded with gas bombs he built, which will only be used in case of an emergency. As the ship sets sail, Denham wonders about what may be on Skull Island (\"Setting Sail\"). The next morning, Ann gets woken up when Denham's main cameraman, Lumpy, unexpectedly goes on board and tends to her. Ann thanks him for his kindness and, after he leaves, he wonders about the consequences of his job (\"Cabin Soliloquy\"). Back on the main deck, Englehorn starts to distrust Denham (\"Pressure Up\").\n\nAfter two months on the water, Denham explains to Ann about the filming location, Skull Island, and Englehorn and his crew threaten Denham, demanding Denham to explain why they're going to Skull Island. Ann suddenly appears and threatens to blow the ship up using the gas bombs if they don't let Denham go, earning Denham's awe (\"The Mutiny\"). As Englehorn and his crew return to work, Ann defends her actions, saying that Denham is her ticket to getting off the streets just as the ship arrives. As everyone disembarks to explore, Denham tries to take a few shots of Ann playing with some vines until a giant ape named Kong captures her.\n\nDenham tries to film the beast but Kong swipes at him, smashing the camera in the process, grabs Ann, and carries her away (\"Skull Island\"). Kong brings Ann to a high cliff overlooking the forest (\"The Ascent\"). An enraged Denham tells the crew to leave the island and let Ann fend for herself, but upon hearing Lumpy's desire to see Kong, Denham decides to make Kong a tourist attraction. As they climb through the forest, he wonders about the opportunity and profit of capturing Kong. (\"The World\"). Meanwhile, Ann wakes up to face Kong in his cave. At first, she is frightened by the beast, but after having a roaring contest with him, she builds the courage to see beyond his harsh exterior. Kong protects her when she is almost attacked by a giant snake (\"The Cobra Fight\"), and as Ann patches his wounds, the two bond (\"Full Moon Lullaby\").\n\nWhile Kong falls asleep, Ann quickly runs off, back into the jungle. Kong quickly realizes she's gone, prompting him to chase after her (\"The Descent\"). Ann bumps into Denham and Lumpy, the latter of whom is overjoyed to see her, and the former telling her that a queen would scream for Kong. Ann remorsefully complies, bringing Kong to where the rest of the ship's crew is waiting, and causing Kong to get ambushed and knocked unconscious by the gas bombs (\"Kong's Capture\").\n\n(\"Entr'acte: The Voyager Returns\") Back in New York, Denham advertises for his show in which he intends to present a now captive Kong to audiences (\"It's Man\"). During rehearsal (\"The Wild and Perilous Sea\"), a guilt-ridden Ann abandons the rehearsal and Denham chases after her, finding her outside the theater. She explains that she can't put on a show like this due to her friendship with Kong, but Denham threatens her with being deemed as insane and jobless.\n\nAnn, horrified at Denham's behavior, decides to visit a captive Kong. She explains that she never meant for any of the past events to happen and tries to comfort him (\"Last of Our Kind\"). At first, Kong doesn't respond to her, but after she notices that he's effectively dying, aggressively commenting on that fact, the two rekindle their friendship.\n\nOn the opening night, Ann is still unsure about Denham's show (\"Last of Our Kind\" (Reprise)), before going onstage and starting the performance. When it comes time for her to scream for Kong, she notices his declining health. Despite Denham's repeated demands for her to scream and wake Kong up, she defiantly refuses (\"Scream for the Money\"). She shouts for Kong to fight back and is quickly grabbed and dragged offstage, where she lets out a true scream. In response, Kong swiftly breaks free from his shackles as the curtain falls. Denham unsuccessfully tries to keep the audience and remaining actors onstage calm (\"Dance My Way to the Light\" (Reprise)) while Kong roars from behind the curtain.\n\nKong rampages through the city in an attempt to find Ann (\"Broadway Nightmare\"). The two finally find each other, and Kong, with Ann climbing on his back, takes off running as the army shoots him (\"NYC Chase\"). Kong stops at the bottom of the half-completed Empire State Building and immediately starts climbing it (\"Empire Ascent\"). Back at the ruined theater, Lumpy enters to tell Denham that he's quitting, explaining that what they did wasn't right and that it isn't about the money, leaving Denham alone (\"The World\" (Reprise)).\n\nOn top of the Empire State Building, Ann marvels over the view from there, but then notices that Kong is slowly dying and tries to reassure Kong just as Army planes arrive to shoot him down (\"Air War\"). Kong destroys some planes, but sustains injuries from the bullets to his body before another set of planes swoop by and finish him off, causing him to fall to the ground (\"Empire Soliloquy\"). Ann grieves over the loss of Kong as she manages to make her way down from the Empire State Building. As she reaches the streets, she tries to spread the word on how Kong wasn't a monster, or an attraction to be displayed, but a wonder (\"The Wonder\").",

Milne . The three previous shorts were combined into the feature-length The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh , released in 1977.",
        "synopsis": "The film begins with Pooh taking a walk to a wooden bridge over a river where he likes to do nothing in particular. On the way, he finds a fir cone and picks it up only to trip and drop the cone into the river. Noticing that the flow of the river takes the cone under the bridge, Pooh invents a racing game out of it. As the game uses sticks instead of cones, he calls it \" Poohsticks \".\n\nSometime later, Pooh, Piglet , Rabbit and Roo are playing Poohsticks when they see Eeyore floating in the river. After being rescued, Eeyore tells them that he fell in due to being bounced from behind. The gang accuses Tigger of causing this, which he denies until the narrator reveals that Tigger had indeed deliberately bounced Eeyore earlier. As Tigger leaves in disgust, Pooh and his friends notice that Eeyore is gloomier than usual.\n\nPooh follows Eeyore to his Gloomy Spot, where he learns that it is Eeyore's birthday, but nobody has taken any notice to celebrate it. Feeling sorry for Eeyore, Pooh decides to give him an empty honey pot as a birthday present and has Owl write a message on the pot. Afterwards, Owl flies off to tell Christopher Robin about the birthday. Meanwhile, Piglet, who was informed by Pooh of the situation, prepares to give a balloon to Eeyore, but gets distracted by Owl and accidentally causes the balloon to pop. A saddened Piglet presents the balloon to Eeyore anyway as Pooh arrives with the empty honey pot a minute later. Eeyore is gladdened, as he can now put the broken balloon into the pot and remove it again.\n\nLater, a party is thrown for Eeyore during which Tigger invites himself to the festivities. A debate ensues over whether or not Tigger should stay at the party due to the way he treated Eeyore earlier until Christopher Robin suggests that they all play Poohsticks at the wooden bridge. Eeyore wins the most games despite being a first-time player, but Tigger wins nothing at all, much to his dismay. With the day ending, most of the cast go home, with Eeyore accompanying a sad Tigger and cheering him up. Finally, Christopher Robin, Pooh and Piglet are the only ones remaining at the bridge and they decide that \"Tigger's all right, really\" and \"everyone's all right, really\".",

The musical debuted on Broadway in 1948 and was revived on Broadway and in the West End . Ray Bolger starred, and sang the popular song \"Once in Love with Amy\".",
        "synopsis": "Act I The setting is Oxford University in the year 1892 where a group of college seniors are bidding farewell to the years gone by (\"The Years Before Us\"). In his dorm room, graduating Jack Chesney is excitedly talking with his butler, Brassett, making sure that luncheon will be ready for later that afternoon. He is so excited because his roommate, Charley Wykeham, has gone to the train station to meet his aunt, Donna Lucia D'Alvadorez, who is coming in from Brazil for a visit. Having Charley's aunt there as chaperone will make it quite easy for their two girl friends, Kitty Verdun and Amy Spettigue, to come for a visit.\n\nCharley does return \u2013 but without his aunt. Apparently, she never was on the train. After reading her letter more carefully, Charley realizes that he made a mistake \u2013 she will be coming on a later one. Not having Charley's aunt there will make it impossible for the girls to stay \u2013 no decent girl would remain with two young men unchaperoned. The girls arrive early, and just as expected decide they must leave \u2013 not seeing Charley's Aunt Donna Lucia. (\"Better Get Out Of Here\"). Actually, they are more worried about being caught by their guardian, Mr. Spettigue, (Amy's uncle) who keeps a tight rein on the girls. The girls do leave.\n\nAfter the girls' departure, the boys are a bit depressed; nevertheless, they know that the girls will return when Charley's Aunt is there. In the meantime, Charley tries on his costume for the upcoming student production in which he is appearing. While Charley is doing this, Jack's father, Sir Francis Chesney, makes a surprise visit and informs his son that they are actually penniless. Jack suggests that possibly a wealthy marriage could alleviate their problems and suggests that Charley's rich widow Aunt Donna Lucia might just be the woman for his father to wed. All Sir Francis needs to do is charm her when she comes for lunch later that day. The plan seems to be perfect.\n\nAfter Jack's father leaves, Charley re-enters in costume rehearsing his lines for the school play. It appears that he will be playing a rather mature older woman \u2013 much like his Aunt Donna Lucia. Just then, he is informed by telegram that his aunt will not be arriving for lunch. Instead, she will surprise him at a later date. Jack is upset most of all because this will be his last chance to propose to Kitty \u2013 tomorrow she leaves for Scotland. The young ladies unexpectedly appear again assuming that a chaperone is there, and in a fit of desperation, Jack suggests that Charley pose as his aunt \u2013 anyway he's wearing the costume right now. Charley does pose as his aunt and fools the girls. They cover for Charley saying that he's not feeling well and has retired to his room.\n\nThe girls' guardian, Mr. Spettigue, comes looking for the girls, and everyone rushes out to hide from him \u2013 everyone except Charley who stays to tell Mr. Spettigue that she is \"the only young lady present.\" She finally hits him with her fan and says \"Be gone my good man and don't bother me any longer.\" Utterly baffled and confused, Mr. Spettigue leaves, and the girls and Jack return. Sir Francis then enters the scene and escorts Charley to lunch all ready to woo a rich woman into marriage. Just then, Mr. Spettigue re-enters and sees the girls there just as he suspected. He is quite angry until he learns that this \"woman/chaperone\" who dismissed him only a few moments earlier is actually the wealthy Donna Lucia D'Alvadorez from Brazil \u2013 \"where the nuts come from.\" He, too, is smitten by this rich available widow and is ready to make his move. Together, Sir Francis, Charley, and Mr. Spettigue go off to lunch. It's Charley's job to keep them occupied. Jack, Kitty, and Amy all go off to watch the parade and look for Charley.\n\nThe scene shifts to a street where the students' band is marching. Everyone is excited by what they hear and see. (\"The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students' Conservatory Band\")\n\nIn a garden, Charley is returning from having just entertained both men. Charley is ready to change back into his regular clothes and go and find Amy who must be wondering where he is. Jack is still frantic and begs Charley to continue for a short while longer so he can talk with Kitty. Charley doesn't care \u2013 he has had just about all he can take and goes off to change and find Amy. Kitty comes looking for Donna Lucia, but instead finds herself alone with Jack. It is there that the two are finally able to express their undying love and devotion for each other (\"My Darling, My Darling\").\n\nJack's father finds Kitty and Jack together and asks that he speak with his son. It appears that he is going to take his son's advice and marry Donna Lucia. Jack tells him that this is impossible; however, Sir Francis is now more determined than ever. Charley then appears as himself and finally gets to talk with Amy. He apologizes for his absence, and rushes to talk to Amy about their future together before her uncle returns and whisks her away. While Charley only wishes to propose marriage and speak of a future together, Amy only wants to speak of the future \u2013 a time of progress with wireless telegraphy, horseless carriages, and stereopticons that move. (\"Make A Miracle\")\n\nMr. Spettigue enters to find Amy with Charley and tells her to collect her things. They are leaving for good! He has been waiting for far too long for Donna Lucia, and is now ready to take Amy home. In a desperate moment, Charley tells Mr. Spettigue that his aunt really is in love with him. In fact, she's up in Charley's room right now resting from the emotional shock of meeting him. He knows that she'll be back soon. It's just that she has some business to attend to \u2013 like writing letters to her banks. The greedy Mr. Spettigue agrees to wait and ponders his possible future and fortune with Lucia (\"Serenade with Asides\")\n\nCharley returns as Donna Lucia, and chases Mr. Spettigue around the garden. In the midst of all this, Jack informs Charley that his father is going to propose to him. In fact, Sir Francis enters and asks Charley to marry him. Charley turns him down, but runs off again as he hears a playful Mr. Spettigue approaching.\n\nIn the midst of all this, a woman (Charley's real aunt) enters and approaches Sir Francis about finding Charley. As the two look at each other, they realize that they know each other from more than twenty years ago. Sir Francis doesn't know that she is actually Charley's rich Aunt Donna Lucia; in fact, he points out to her that Charley's aunt is right there with them \u2013 running around being chased by Mr. Spettigue. She is quite intrigued by it all, and poses as Mrs. Beverly Smythe to better survey the situation. The two then look at each other once more and recall that time long ago when they first met. (\"Lovelier Than Ever\").\n\nJack and Charley are going over things, and Kitty and Amy enter to inform Jack that the only way they'll get to marry the girls is to get Mr. Spettigue's consent in writing. The girls also confide in Charley that they are actually really in love with Charley and Jack, but if they don't get consent to the marriages in writing from Mr. Spettigue, they will be financially cut off for good. Charley agrees to get the written consent from Mr. Spettigue and goes off to do so. Kitty and Jack leave Amy alone to think about Charley and all that is happening. Just where has Charley been? She's crazy about him, but can't help thinking that he's off with another girl \u2013 possibly the girl she saw in a picture sitting on his piano. (\"The Woman In His Room\")\n\nBrassett enters and sets tea. Charley returns still dressed as his aunt and tells Amy that Charley has sent a message to her \u2013 he loves her very much. Sir Francis and the real Donna Lucia (still posing as Beverly Smythe) enter and unexpectedly join them for tea. During a madcap tea party, Donna Lucia presses Charley for information about his/her life in Brazil. Charley tells her about the place where Donna Lucia lived \u2013 Pernambuco. A song and ballet sequence (seen through Charley's eyes) revealing just how Donna Lucia and her rich husband met and lived together ends the first act. (\"Pernambuco\")\n\nAct 2 The act opens with the Oxford senior graduates posing for their class picture \u2013 complete with caps and gowns. They are all there except for Charley. He promised that he'd be there. (\"Where's Charley?\") Fortunately, he does make it there \u2013 just as the picture is being taken.\n\nWalking along a street, Charley tries to explain all of his disappearances to Amy, who tries her best to believe him. She also tells him that her uncle is ready to sign a wedding consent form, but Donna Lucia must meet him to get the document. Charley assures her that \"she'll\" be there, but also tells her that he can't be there at the same time. She doesn't quite know what is going on; however, she trusts him and is excited about marrying him. She leaves Charley alone, and there on that street he thinks about Amy \u2013 the most wonderful girl in the whole world (\"Once in Love with Amy\")\n\nLater that day, the girls are in the dressing room preparing themselves for the evening's big dance. While dressing and primping, they also go over all of the most recent events. (\"The Gossips\") Kitty drags a reluctant Charley \u2013 once again dressed as Donna Lucia \u2013 to the dressing room. The real Donna Lucia enters and has a good bit of fun making Charley feel uncomfortable while all the ladies ready themselves for the evening's fun. The ladies eventually all leave and Charley is left alone to talk with Mr. Spettigue who comes to play with his new love. Charley fights off Mr. Spettigue's forced advances and finally demands that he be given the letter of consent that has been promised all along. If Mr. Spettigue goes and gets the letter right now, Charley promises that they can announce their own engagement at the ball. Mr. Spettigue excitedly, dashes off to get the letter and meet his love at the ball.\n\nStrolling down a garden path Donna Lucia asks Sir Francis if it isn't strange that they have never seen Charley and his aunt together at the same time. Sir Francis has no interest in any of that. All he cares about is dancing the night away with his long lost love. The same is true of Jack and Kitty. In fact, everyone is dancing the night away in love (\"Red Rose Cotillion\") Charley even makes an appearance as himself to keep poor little Amy happy and content.\n\nMr. Spettigue finally appears and announces the engagement of Kitty and Amy to Jack and Charley. He gives Charley (again dressed as his aunt) the letter of consent. Charley sneaks off and reappears as himself once more. Mr. Spettigue wants to see Charley's aunt one more time, so Charley goes to get her. Mr. Spettigue asks to see Charley, the nephew, once again, and a rather \"tired\" Charley dashes off to get him. While rushing, Jack accidentally steps on the hem of Charley's skirt and all is \"revealed.\" Charley admits to Amy and everyone that he did it all because of love. Mr. Spettigue is angry and doesn't care that they are in love. Charley tells him that they have the letter of consent, which is all they need. Mr. Spettigue fights them by telling them that he will dispute this. The real Donna Lucia finally steps forward and says that indeed the letter of consent was addressed to her and is a legal document \u2013 and she puts her blessing on the wedding. There is nothing Spettigue or anyone can do. All is forgiven and everyone (except for Mr. Spettigue) is happy. (Reprise: \"My Darling, My Darling\")",

        "synopsis": "By the year 2056, an epidemic of organ failures has devastated the planet and wiped out 99% of the human population. The megacorporation GeneCo provides organ transplants on a payment plan. Clients who miss payments are hunted down by Repo Men, skilled assassins who \"repossess\" the organs (\"Genetic Repo Man\"). The CEO of GeneCo, Rotti Largo, discovers he is terminally ill. Rotti's children Luigi, Pavi, and Amber bicker over who will inherit GeneCo (\"Mark It Up\"), but Rotti believes none of them are worthy heirs and instead plans to give his fortune to 17-year-old Shilo Wallace, the daughter of his late ex-fianc\u00e9e Marni (\"Things You See in a Graveyard\").\n\nShilo has inherited a rare blood disease from Marni that requires her to stay indoors, though she longs to see the outside world (\"Infected\"). Shilo's overprotective father, Nathan believes he accidentally killed Marni with a treatment he created for her illness \u2013 in truth, a jealous Rotti secretly poisoned Marni's medicine and blackmailed Nathan, promising not to arrest him for manslaughter if he agreed to become GeneCo's head Repo Man, though he has convinced Shilo he is a doctor (\"Legal Assassin\"). One night, Shilo secretly visits Marni's tomb and runs into the omniscient GraveRobber, who is digging up bodies to extract Zydrate, a euphoric and addictive painkiller that he sells on the street to keep up with his GeneCo payments (\"21st Century Cure\").\n\nRotti lures Shilo to GeneCo's fair with promises of a cure for her disease. There, she meets Blind Mag, an opera singer and GeneCo's celebrity spokesperson. Born blind, Mag has been given surgically enhanced eyes by GeneCo at the cost of indefinite employment, though she is soon resigning. GraveRobber helps Shilo escape the fairgrounds, encountering several of his customers, including the surgery-addicted Amber (\"Zydrate Anatomy\"). Shilo learns that Mag's eyes are set for repossession and that Amber will replace her as GeneCo's spokeswoman. After GeneCops arrive, Shilo quickly returns to her room before Nathan notices her missing.\n\nNathan refuses to repossess Mag's eyes, citing her close friendship with Marni (\"Night Surgeon\"). Infuriated, Rotti vows to have Nathan taken out. Mag visits Shilo, reveals that she is her godmother and that Nathan had told her Shilo died alongside Marni, and cautions Shilo not to make the same mistakes she did (\"Chase The Morning\"). Nathan arrives and ousts Mag after she scolds him for lying to her and incarcerating Shilo (\"Everyone's a Composer\"). Shilo begs him to let Mag hide from the Repo Man in their house, but Nathan refuses, leading Shilo to snap and finally condemn her father for his overbearing treatment of her and inability to move on from Marni's death (\"Seventeen\"). Meanwhile, Rotti writes his will, ready to make Shilo his sole beneficiary (\"Gold\").\n\nRotti invites Shilo to the Opera. Nathan heads out to find her, pursued by GeneCops, whom he quickly dispatches (\"At the Opera Tonight\"). Amber makes her stage debut, but her performance is ruined when her transplanted face falls off. Mag completes her final performance, but deviates from the song's grand finale, denouncing the Largo family and gouging out her eyes in an act of defiance (\"Chromaggia\"). Rotti cuts the cords suspending Mag, impaling her on a fence, but assures the panicking audience that Mag's death was staged as part of the show.\n\nShilo is approached by a Repo Man and attacks him with a shovel, revealing him as Nathan, much to her horror (\"Let the Monster Rise\"). Onstage, Rotti reveals that Nathan has been poisoning Shilo's \"medicine\" in an attempt to keep her safe from the outside world after being unable to cope with the loss of Marni. As his health rapidly declines, Rotti offers Shilo GeneCo if she kills her father. When she refuses, Rotti uses the last of his strength to fatally shoot Nathan, and dies after disowning his children. After a tearful farewell to her father (\"I Didn't Know I'd Love You So Much\"), Shilo decides that Nathan's actions do not dictate her future (\"Genetic Emancipation\").\n\nShilo flees, leaving GeneCo with no legal heir. Amber inherits the company instead and auctions her fallen face to charity, which Pavi wins after Luigi kills the top three bidders.",

        "synopsis": "ACT 1\n\nA steamy summer morning in the rural deep South of 1918. A gang of prisoners works along the dusty roadway leading to Fairweather State Prison (Ball and Chain). Jonas Candide, an ex-carnival barker and con-man who is now employed as the state's official \"travelling executioner\" arrives at the prison with his electric chair (Hubbub). He has come to attend to his next \"clients\" Willie and Gretchen Herzallerliebst, brother and sister German immigrants who have been convicted of murder.\n\nUpon arrival, Jonas learns from the warden that the woman has been granted a short stay while her lawyer tries to convince the Governor to commute her sentence. Proceeding with Willie's execution, Jonas demonstrates his unique approach to the job (The Fields of Ambrosia). But something goes wrong (How Could This Happen?). Happy to put the day's events behind him, Jonas treats Jimmy, the gawky, young town mortician who idolizes him, to a night of debauchery at the local whorehouse (Nuthin').\n\nThe next evening, to satisfy his curiosity, Jonas visits Gretchen Herzallediebst in her cell. He is smitten by her beauty and wit (Who Are You?). In return for her \"favors\", Jonas is persuaded to buy her some more time by hiding his chair and convincing the warden that it was stolen (Reasonable Man). Gretchen's lawyer, not satisfied with that, discovers the hiding place and disables the chair with a fireaxe.\n\nJonas must take the chair to the local fix-it shop for repair, where the sight of it creates quite a stir among the locals (Step Right Up). Unable to stay away, he visits Gretchen again and is seduced even further (Too Bad).\n\nJonas comes up with a plan to save Gretchen. When the chair is ready, he will proceed with her execution, but give her only enough voltage to knock her out. Meanwhile, he will have struck a deal with the dissolute prison doctor to pronounce her dead and persuaded Jimmy to carry her out like a cadaver with no one the wiser. Doc is reluctant, saying that it's too risky and won't work. Jonas demonstrates his theory on a prison rat (The Rat is Dead). The Doc finally agrees to play his part... for a five hundred dollar bribe! Jonas vows to somehow raise the money and free Gretchen (Step Right Up - reprise).\n\nACT 2\n\nGretchen takes her mandatory hour of exercise on the prison yard inside a huge, wire cage which protects her from the male prisoners (Hungry). Jonas arrives, and bribes the guard for a moment alone with Gretchen to let her know of his plan to save her (Continental Sunday).\n\nJonas springs into action to raise the money to pay Doc, He smuggles the town whores into the prison late at night and, posting Jimmy as a lookout, turns Doc's infirmary into an impromptu bordello. Doc stumbles in and seeing Jonas' resourcefulness, raises his asking price to a thousand! Jonas, wondering what the hell happened to his lookout, finds Jimmy completely distraught after being assaulted by some of the inmates (Alone). Moved by Jimmy's plight, Jonas makes him his new assistant.\n\nJonas gets into a high-stakes poker game (The Card Game) and wins the thousand, only to be jumped, beaten and robbed by the losers . Bruised, bloody and completely broke, Jonas returns to the prison to find Deputy Warden Piquant ready to string Gretchen up while the Warden is away at the county seat. By assuring him that the chair will be ready the next morning, Jonas gets him to relent (The Gallows).\n\nWith time running out, Gretchen urges Jonas to try the local bank for the money (Do It for Me). By whipping the bank's patrons into a patriotic fervor over war bonds, he convinces the manager to give him a loan (All in this Together). However, when the manager discovers that Jonas is an ex-con, he reneges . Jonas, in a panic, makes a play for the money. With the bank alarm ringing in his ears, he beats a hasty retreat back to the prison (the getaway) to spring Gretchen, but the escape attempt goes terribly wrong (The Breakout).\n\nSeveral months later, the prison yard is packed with guards and witnesses as Jonas Candide is placed in the refurbished electric chair by Jimmy, the new executioner. Jimmy gets so excited as Jonas regales him with descriptions of the hereafter (The Fields of Ambrosia - reprise) that he revs the generator way too high. When Jimmy pulls the switch everything goes up in flame and smoke. As the smoke begins to clear, we glimpse an image of Gretchen and Jonas alone on stage, waltzing.",

When his Creole grandmother discovers his new lifestyle, she disowns him.\n\nForced to go on the road, Morton becomes a prominent composer and musician, and the self-proclaimed creator of jazz.

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nA dance number from Gloria Estefan 's dancers leads to backstage with Gloria, Emilio Estefan , and their son, Nayib before a concert in 1990 (\" Rhythm Is Gonna Get You \").\n\nIn a flashback, Gloria is younger, playing the guitar and singing to send a recording to her father, Jos\u00e9 Fajardo, who is stationed in Vietnam. (\"Cuando Sal\u00ed de Cuba\"). Gloria grows up in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami , with her mother, Gloria Fajardo, and grandmother, Consuelo Garc\u00eda. During the dance number, Gloria is shown as older (\" Tradici\u00f3n \").\n\nAs time progresses, Gloria is introduced by her grandmother to Emilio Estefan , who is a part of a group, then called the Miami Latin Boys. Emilio invites Gloria to perform one of the songs she has written at their upcoming rehearsal. Gloria, who is studying to be a psychologist and spending most of her extra time caring for her father through his battle with multiple sclerosis , is initially resistant to the idea of performing. With pressure from her grandmother, she attends the rehearsals, despite push-back from her mother. She brings her sister, Rebecca Fajardo, mother, and grandmother the day of. Gloria performs and has her sister come with her on stage for \"emotional support,\" (\" Anything for You \"). Despite initially being shy, and not wanting to be in the spotlight, she finds her place after being given advice from Emilio (\" 1-2-3 \"). Gloria realizes she is falling for Emilio, and Emilio is feeling the same way (\" I See Your Smile \").\n\nGloria's mother is initially not on board with Gloria joining the Miami Latin Boys (renamed the Miami Sound Machine ), and when Gloria is frustrated that her mother doesn't like Emilio, Consuelo tells her that when her mother was younger she wanted to be a singer too. Gloria Fajardo was offered a contract with Twentieth Century Fox to be the Spanish voice of Shirley Temple , but her father forbade it. A flashback follows, of Gloria Fajardo performing in a club and finds out during the performance she learns she has to flee Cuba without her love, Jos\u00e9 Fajardo. (\" Mi Tierra \")\n\nLater, Gloria and Emilio propose a new song to Phil, a record label executive, but he refuses to publish it because it is in English. Then, on July 4, Emilio and Gloria go on a date where Gloria kisses Emilio for the first time. (\" Con Los A\u00f1os Que Me Quedan \"). They try to discuss the single, but Gloria is lost in Emilio, and her love for him (\" Here We Are \"). Gloria is spending time with her father, Jos\u00e9 Fajardo, and although he cannot speak, she wishes she could hear what he would say about Emilio. She imagines the advice he would give her (\"When Someone Comes into Your Life\"). Gloria then writes a song using the encores they played on tour in Holland, with all the lyrics in English. Executive Chris is initially not backing it, and won't propose it to Phil, so they have to \"bring Phil to the song,\" before they can release it. Gloria initially performs her new song at a Bar Mitzvah for a boy named Jeremy, and Phil refuses to attend. Then she performs it at an Italian wedding, and Phil still will not come. It is not until she performs it at a Shriners convention in Las Vegas that Phil wants to attend (\" Conga \").\n\n### Act II\n\nGloria and Emilio hit the top of the music charts and launch a worldwide tour (\" Get on Your Feet \"). Gloria is thankful for the fact that her grandmother Consuelo had encouraged her to pursue a music career and even calls Consuelo on stage during one of her performances (\" Live for Loving You \").\nHowever, Gloria also struggles with the exhausting schedule, and the fact that her mother has become estranged due to her disapproval (and potential jealousy) of Gloria's fame (\" You'll Be Mine (Party Time) \"). Even though Gloria is exhausted and wants to take a couple of days off, Emilio encourages her to take on one other concert in Syracuse . On the road, the Estefans' bus collides with a semi truck during a snowstorm (\"Famous\").\n\nGloria breaks her back in the accident, and is flown to New York City for emergency spinal surgery. Gloria's mother rushes to the hospital after hearing about Gloria's accident on the news and she and Emilio bond over their love for Gloria (\"If I Never Got to Tell You\"). Emilio worries Gloria might not survive the surgery (\" Don't Wanna Lose You \"). During her surgery, Gloria imagines seeing her late father Jos\u00e9 and her grandmother Consuelo, who had died a couple of months before (\" Wrapped \"). They both encourage her to live. After coming out of surgery, Gloria finally reconciles with her mother. Doctors tell Gloria she may never walk again, but she dedicates herself to rehabilitation.\n\nThousands of fan letters, and Emilio's steadfast determination, provide her the encouragement she needs to get back on her feet (\" Reach \"). Gloria makes a triumphant return to the stage with her performance at the 1991 American Music Awards (\" Coming Out of the Dark \").",

        "description": "Imagine This is a musical with music by Shuki Levy , lyrics by David Goldsmith and a book by Glenn Berenbeim. Set in the Warsaw Ghetto during World War II, it focuses on a family of actors trying to stage a play about the siege at ancient Masada to inspire hope and optimism within the Jewish community.",
        "synopsis": "After a glimpse of happier times in Poland before World War II, the scene shifts to 1942 in the Warsaw Ghetto. There, a company of actors is headed by actor-manager Daniel Warshowsky. Daniel's wife is taken by Nazis .\n\nAs the company rehearses a play, Adam, a resistance fighter, bursts in and is hidden by the actors. The Nazis follow and arrest Daniel's son. Being one actor short, Daniel tells Adam he will have to play his son's part. Adam tells the company about the fate awaiting those who board the train to Treblinka . He believes that it is necessary to resist the Nazis. Daniel, on the other hand, believes in theatre as a way to help the Ghetto inhabitants escape the horrible reality in which they live (\"Imagine This\").\n\nDaniel and the company stage a play about the siege and mass suicide of the Jews at the fortress at Masada around 70 CE by the Roman Empire . The story of the resistance in ancient times parallels the determination by the inhabitants of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1942 to resist the Nazis. Daniel plays the leader of the ancient rebellion, Eleazar ben Ya'ir , and his daughter Rebecca plays Eleazar's daughter Tamar. Tamar is loved by the Roman General Lucius Flavius Silva , played by Adam. Just before the interval, the Nazis board the stage and promise the audience two loaves of bread and a jar of jam if they board the trains to \"a new life in the east\" on the following morning.  They ask the Jews to bring a suitcase each, containing their most precious belongings.\n\nThe Nazis offer Daniel and his company safe passage to Switzerland if they carry on with the play in order to keep the Jews calm. The company struggles to decide between collaboration with the Nazis in return for their freedom and life, and sacrificing themselves in order to warn their audience. They decide that those who support standing for the truth will get up after the scene of mass suicide in Masada, and if even one person does not stand they will do nothing. When the scene is complete, they get up one by one until all stand.  When the play draws to a close, the Masada landscape is lowered to reveal graffiti written by the actors warning the Jews not to board the train. The outraged Nazis storm the stage, push the company (except Rebecca and Adam) off the stage and murder them (off stage). Adam fights Captain Blick (the Nazi commander), and Rebecca grabs Blick's pistol and shoots him. Adam and Rebecca are presumed to survive.\n\nAll the characters return in their pre-war attire to sing \"Imagine This\".\n\n(The Warsaw character names are followed by the Masada character names in brackets)",

        "description": "A New Brain is a musical with music and lyrics by William Finn and book by Finn and James Lapine . Though many of Finn's previous musicals are to some extent autobiographical, A New Brain deals directly with his own harrowing experience with an arteriovenous malformation and the healing power of art. The protagonist of the musical, Gordon Schwinn, worries that he may not live to complete his work. Finn wrote many of the songs soon after his release from the hospital. The musical premiered Off-Broadway in 1998 and has been revived in the U.S., England and elsewhere.",
        "synopsis": "Lisa, a homeless woman, asks the audience for some change. Songwriter Gordon Schwinn works at his piano to meet a deadline, irritated because he must write a song about spring for children's television host Mr. Bungee, who dresses as a frog (\"Prologue: Frogs Have So Much Spring (The Spring Song)\"). Gordon takes a break from writing The Spring Song to meet his best friend Rhoda at a restaurant, where the waitress, who is a fan of Mr. Bungee, informs Gordon and Rhoda of the specials at the restaurant, including \"Calamari\". During lunch, he clutches his head and falls face first into his meal. Rhoda calls an ambulance (\"911 Emergency\") and Gordon is taken to the hospital. Gordon's greatest fear is dying with his greatest songs still inside him (\"I Have so Many Songs\"), to which he ponders about what makes a song (\"Heart and Music\"). Gordon's mother, Mimi, arrives and insists that (\"Mother's Gonna Make Things Fine\"). A neurosurgeon, Dr. Jafar Berensteiner, explains that there's (\"Trouble in His Brain\") and that an MRI is necessary.\n\nGordon snaps at Mimi for underestimating his condition and not listening to the Doctor, to which a hallucination of Mr. Bungee appears, telling Gordon to \"Be Polite to Everybody\", and Gordon tells it to leave. Gordon daydreams about his boyfriend Roger, who is on his way to the hospital from a \"Sailing\" trip. The nurses, sadistic Nancy D. and compassionate Richard, are introduced. Nancy D. requests a \"Family History\", prompting Gordon to ponder why he only inherited the bad traits from his parents (\"Gordo's Law of Genetics\"). He reflects on his father's abandonment (\"And They're Off\"). \"Roger Arrives\" and spends some time with Gordon, who tells him to \"Just Go\". Richard enters to give Gordon a sponge bath in preparation for his \"MRI Tomorrow\". During the sponge bath, Richard complains that he is \"Poor, Unsuccessful, and Fat\". Gordon hallucinates and sees Mr. Bungee, who continually bullies him. Gordon is visited by a minister, who tries to impose his Protestant beliefs on Gordon, who is Jewish. Gordon asks him to leave, and goes to sleep.\n\nGordon is woken by Nancy, who informs him that it's \"MRI Day\". To cope with his claustrophobia, he thinks about a past sailing trip with Roger (\"Sitting Becalmed in the Lee of Cuttyhunk\"). Dr. Berensteiner tells Gordon that he has an arteriovenous malformation , and that Gordon needs a \" Craniotomy \". Nancy D. informs him of the risks - if he doesn't go through with the operation, he could die, however, if Dr. Berensteiner is not exact with his surgery, he could also die. Gordon, given the choice by the Doctor, decides to go through with the operation, and Roger offers to sleep with Gordon that night (\"An Invitation to Sleep In My Arms\"). Rhoda arrives with news that Mr. Bungee needs a new song by the next morning, so Gordon declines Roger's offer and decides to write instead. He then hallucinates about Lisa, who he encountered earlier on his way to lunch with Rhoda. Lisa implores the audience for \"Change\", both physical money and social change. Gordon presents his new song, \"Yes\", to Mr. Bungee, who hates it, storming off to leave Gordon dejected \"In the Middle of the Room\". Mimi cleans Gordon's apartment, and in a rage, throws out all of his books (\"Throw It Out\"). Gordon waits anxiously as his surgery is delayed (\"In the Middle of the Room (Reprise)\"). Then the operation commences.\n\nRoger, distraught about the surgery, encounters Lisa, who consoles him (\"A Really Lousy Day in the Universe\"). In a coma, Gordon hallucinates a surreal mini-opera featuring people from his life (\"Brain Dead\", \"Whenever I Dream\", \"Eating Myself Up Alive\", \"The Music Still Plays On\"), concluding with a friendly Mr. Bungee telling Gordon \"Don't Give In\", leading him back to consciousness. Dr. Berensteiner celebrates the successful surgery (\"Craniotomy (Reprise)\"). Gordon and Roger fool around in the hospital shower, much to Richard's dismay (\"You Boys Are Gonna Get Me In Such Trouble!\"). Gordon expresses his new appreciation for life (\"Sailing (Reprise)\").\n\nMonths later, Gordon has recovered and is enjoying a new, more fulfilled life with Roger. They run into Lisa, who is selling Gordon's books that Mimi threw out. Gordon and Roger ask for them back, but she refuses (\"On the Street (The Homeless Lady's Revenge)\"). She flees, leaving Gordon furious, but Roger calms him down (\"Time\"). Gordon has apparently overcome his fear of dying with his greatest songs inside him (\"Time and Music\"). With his life at last in balance, he is able to write again and finishes the spring song (\"I Feel so Much Spring\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nGlamorous but pretentious Oyster Bay , Long Island socialite Tracy Samantha Lord is planning a lavish June 1938 wedding to an equally pretentious executive, George Kittredge. Guests include her mother, grumpy little sister Dinah, and absent-minded Uncle Willy, who lives in a house near the Lord estate. Willy is hosting a party for the wedding guests that evening, the night before the wedding. Tracy's unwelcome ex-husband and neighbor, C.K. Dexter Haven, sails up to the estate in his yacht. Dexter informs Tracy and her family that tabloid reporters Mike Connor and Liz Imbrie will be covering the wedding for Spy while pretending to be guests.  Dexter invited them to stop Spy from publishing an expos\u00e9 of Tracy's father Seth, who is estranged from Tracy's mother because he is having an affair with a dancer, Tina Mara. Dexter tries to convince the suspicious Dinah of his good intentions.\n\nWhen Mike and Liz arrive, Tracy and Dinah do not let on that they know of the reporters' charade. Tracy pretends that Uncle Willie is her father, but when her father arrives, she pretends that he is Uncle Willie. Dexter confronts Tracy about their relationship, leaving her confused; suddenly George seems so pompous.  She also is finding Mike to be sweet and remembers some good times with Dexter on his yacht.  She starts drinking champagne before the party at Uncle Willie's even begins.\n\n### Act II\n\nAfter the party, Tracy is still drinking champagne, and she misbehaves, dancing with the staff and Mike. George is angry and embarrassed. Dinah hurries to Dexter's house, finding him packing for a trip. She calls him a coward and informs him that Tracy is drinking champagne, which he knows makes her wild. After many farcical comings and goings back at the estate, George reminds Tracy of their wedding the next day, warns her about her behavior and stomps away. Mike tells Tracy that George is not good enough for her. He kisses her, and she tipsily invites him to go skinny dipping in the pool. Dexter and Dinah return to witness other romantic entanglements unfolding between Seth and his wife and Uncle Willy and Liz, who really loves Mike. As soon as Tracy gets in the water, the champagne catches up with her, and Mike puts her innocently in her bed.\n\nIn the morning, Tracy realizes that she was in the pool with Mike and, her memory hazy, fears that she made love to him, ruining her wedding and social standing. All works out in the end, however, with Tracy's parents reuniting, the blackmail threat quashed, Mike realizing that he is really in love with Liz, and Tracy reuniting with Dexter. Since the wedding is already scheduled and paid for, Dexter steps up and all ends happily.",

        "description": "Starlight Express is a 1984 musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Richard Stilgoe . It tells the story of a young but obsolete steam engine , Rusty, that races in a championship against modern locomotives of diesel and electric engines in the hope of impressing a first-class observation car , Pearl. The actors perform on roller skates .\n\nRunning for 7,409 performances in London, Starlight Express is the tenth-longest-running West End show . It is the most successful musical in Germany, where it has been performed in a purpose-built theatre since 1988, holding the Guinness World Record for most visitors to a musical in a single theatre.",
        "synopsis": "Starlight Express has been revised many times since it was first produced. These revisions range from tweaks to lyrics to adding or removing entire songs, characters and subplots. The fundamental story, however, has stayed the same.\n\nThis synopsis reflects the show as it was first produced, in the West End in 1984.\n\n### Act 1\n\nA young boy falls asleep while playing with his toy trains , announcing it is race night. In his dreams , the trains come to life .\n\nThe reigning champion \u2013 a diesel engine from the U.S.A. called Greaseball \u2013 enters with his cavalcade train of several other diesel engines and three freight trucks. They boast of diesel's supremacy (\"Rolling Stock\"). Next, a steam engine called Rusty enters. Greaseball mocks Rusty, who replies that he will win the championship, despite steam being obsolete compared to diesel (\"Call Me Rusty\"). The dreaming boy, Control, intervenes and orders Rusty to collect a passenger train from the marshalling yard. He returns with four coaches that make up the passenger train: a dining car called Dinah, a smoking car called Ashley, a buffet car called Buffy, and an observation car called Pearl. Control sends Rusty away to fetch a freight train as the coaches introduce themselves to the audience (\"A Lotta Locomotion\"). Greaseball returns. He boasts again, this time to the coaches (\"Pumping Iron\"). Rusty returns with the six trucks that make up the freight train: three boxcars called Rocky 1, Rocky 2 and Rocky 3, a brick truck called Flat-Top, an aggregate hopper called Dustin and a caboose called C.B . They introduce themselves to the audience and argue with the coaches over whether it is preferable to carry people or cargo (\"Freight\").\n\nControl declares entries for the championship open. Six trains arrive to challenge Greaseball: Bobo, the French Sud-Est ; Espresso, the Italian Settebello ; Weltschaft, the German Class 103 ; Turnov, the Trans-Siberian Express from Russia; Hashamoto, the Japanese Shinkansen Bullet Train ; and the City of Milton Keynes, the Advanced Passenger Train from Great Britain. Entries are about to close when a surprise entry \u2013 an electric engine called Electra \u2013 arrives. Accompanied by his train of five components \u2013 an armaments truck called Krupp , a repair truck called Wrench, a money truck called Purse, a freezer truck called Volta and an animal truck called Joule \u2013 Electra declares that electricity is the future of the railways (\"AC/DC\"). Greaseball and Electra square up to each other as the entrants form a parade to celebrate the race (\"Coda of Freight\").\n\nControl announces the rules of the championship: the trains will compete in pairs, with an engine pulling a coach. There will be three elimination heats, and the winner of each heat will move on to the finals to decide the fastest train. The engines start to pick their coaches. Rusty offers to race with Pearl, but she rejects him, explaining that she is waiting for her 'dream train' (\"He Whistled at Me\"). Electra's messenger, Purse, enters with an invitation from Electra. Even though Electra is not her dream train, she accepts, leaving Rusty alone.\n\nThe first heat pits Greaseball and Dinah against Espresso, Buffy, Hashimoto, and C.B. C.B. sabotages Hashimoto by applying his brakes at critical moments in the race. Greaseball and Dinah win comfortably, claiming a place in the finals. After the race, Dinah objects to Greaseball's cheating. In response, he abandons her, and C.B. comforts Dinah (\"There's Me\"). Meanwhile, a lonely Rusty has retreated to the freight yard where the former champion \u2013 an old steam engine called Poppa \u2013 sings a blues song to the trucks (\"Poppa's Blues\"). Poppa tries to persuade Rusty to race without Pearl, urging him to believe in the Starlight Express. When Rusty refuses, Poppa introduces him to an old Pullman car called Memphis Belle (\"Belle The Sleeping Car\"). Rusty agrees to race with Belle. They compete in the second heat against Electra, Pearl, Weltschaft, and Joule. Electra and Pearl finish first, securing a place in the finals; Rusty and Belle finish last.\n\nAlready despondent after losing Pearl as his race partner, Rusty loses his last shreds of confidence. Poppa decides to step up and prove that steam power is still relevant, despite everyone's misgivings, by racing himself in the third heat. Only Dustin is willing to run with him. Rusty points out that the race is already whole, but suddenly, Control announces that the British train has been scrapped, leaving space for a late entry. Poppa interprets this as a sign from the Starlight Express and enters the race. The third heat pits Poppa and Dustin against Bobo, Ashley, Turnov and Wrench. Poppa wins the race, securing a place in the finals against Greaseball and Electra, but the effort of outracing the others and pulling the hefty Dustin exhausts him. Now worn out, he begs Rusty to take his place. Rusty refuses at first, but then he notices Pearl with Electra and is jealous. When C.B. offers to race with him, Rusty announces that he will take Poppa's place. Greaseball and the other competitors mock him and then leave. Alone, Rusty prays to the supposedly mythical Starlight Express for help in the final (\"Starlight Express\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe trains debate whether Rusty should be allowed to take Poppa's place in the finals since he's already competed and lost or whether the area should go to Bobo, who finished second in Poppa's heat (\"The Rap\"). They ultimately decide to let Rusty race. Control offers the engines the chance to change partners. Pearl abandons Electra and joins Greaseball, leaving Dinah feeling betrayed. Dinah expresses shame at being uncoupled, although she cannot speak the word itself (\"U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D.\"). Ashley, Buffy, and Belle try to persuade Dinah to fight for Greaseball's affection (\"Rolling Stock (Reprise)\"), but instead, she accepts an offer from Electra to replace Pearl in the finals. Elsewhere, C.B. hatches a plan. He tells Greaseball he will help him win the championship by sabotaging Rusty. He then tells Electra the same thing. When Electra expresses his surprise at C.B.'s duplicity, C.B. explains that he has spent a career secretly causing train crashes for fun (\"C.B.\").\n\nThe finals take place between Electra and Dinah, Greaseball and Pearl, and Rusty and C.B. C.B. sabotages Rusty, slowing him down so he misses a Movable bridge that is part of the course and cannot finish the race. Electra and Greaseball finish in a dead heat . Control announces that there will be another race, with Electra and Greaseball going head-to-head to decide the winner. Rusty complains that he was cheated, but the marshals refuse to listen. Pearl confronts Greaseball, but he warns her to say nothing, as the marshals would also consider her complicit and punish her. Rusty retreats to the freight yard, where he bumps into the Rockies. They tell him he will never win without luck and should give up (\"Right Place, Right Time\"). The Rockies leave Rusty alone. He appeals again to the mythical Starlight Express for help, and this time, it hears. The Starlight Express, which is portrayed by the same actor as Poppa, appears in front of Rusty. The Starlight Express reminds Rusty that he already possesses the strength he needs if he believes in himself, inspiring him to enter the rerun of the final race. (\"I Am The Starlight\"). The Starlight Express disappears, and Rusty finds himself back in the freight yard with Dustin, who says he was asleep but felt the starlight's presence. Rusty asks Dustin to race with him in the final. He accepts, and they head off together.\n\nMoments before the race, Dinah, angry with how Electra treats her, disconnects from him. Electra quickly appeals to C.B. to take her place. The trains gather to watch what they expect will be a head-to-head final between Greaseball and Pearl and Electra and C.B.. Suddenly, Rusty arrives with Dustin, and the marshals allow him to enter the race. The race is fast and furious. This time, the downhill track turns Dustin's weight into an advantage for Rusty. Greaseball struggles with an unwilling Pearl holding him back, and Electra uses all his power to disrupt his opponents. Electra zaps electricity at Greaseball but misses and injures Pearl. Greaseball, showing no concern, disconnects Pearl at full speed. Rusty diverts from the race course just in time to save her but at the cost of falling into a distant third place. To avoid being disqualified for not having a coach, Greaseball starts to grapple with Electra over C.B. The fight degenerates into chaos, and Greaseball, Electra, and C.B. crash, allowing Rusty to win the race. But instead of celebrating, he leaves immediately to find Pearl. Control warns that Rusty will cancel his lap of honor if he does not return quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, humiliated and infuriated, Electra leaves the race track, swearing never to return (\"No Comeback\"). Greaseball and C.B. emerge in a tangled wreck. They lament the heavy toll their wreck and racing in general has taken on them (\"One Rock 'n' Roll Too Many\"). Poppa demands that Greaseball and C.B. help find Rusty. Away from the other engines, Pearl fears that she caused Rusty to lose the race. She realises that of all the trains she's raced with, only Rusty acted selflessly towards her (\"Only He\"). Rusty arrives. He tells Pearl that he won the race and confesses his love for her (\" Only You \"). The other trains arrive. Greaseball finally apologises to Dinah for his behaviour, and they reconcile. Greaseball complains that he's finished as a racer, but Poppa offers to rebuild him into a steam engine. Control tries to assert some control, announcing that Rusty's lap of honour is cancelled. Tired of Control's behaviour, Poppa and the other engines tell Control to \"shut it\" and celebrate the second coming of steam power (\" Light at the End of the Tunnel \").",

The orange girl is the oldest, who is the matriarch of the group that is in denial about her husband cheating on her. The red girl is insecure about her looks, and she is the youngest of the group. The blue girl is a beauty, and she does not have any friends due to her vanity. The green girl is slutty, and the yellow girl is loud and brass. The yellow girl is also American. Although the five girls are very different, they all have one thing on their mind: \"Love (Talk About Love)\".\n\nThe girls all look to a fictional magazine called Shout! for advice, particularly the columnist named Gwendolyn Holmes (a voiceover role played by Carole Shelley).

Blue decides she prefers diamonds over men (\" Diamonds Are Forever \"), and Red sings her devotion to Edward (\" Puppet on a String \"). Green writes to Gwendolyn about breaking up with her boyfriend because he is bad in bed, and Gwendolyn says that, as a woman, Green should not care about that. Times are changing for these young women, and they know it (\" Georgy Girl \" / \" Windy \").\n\nThe red girl talks about an embarrassing moment with her boyfriend, but her boyfriend keeps loving her anyways (\" Who Am I \").

Blue is upset about not being girl of the year, and yellow is upset that Paul McCartney is married (\" I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself \").\n\nAfter checking their horoscopes and gaining a new style (Notably, Orange is now wearing Purple), they sing a rousing number (\" These Boots Are Made For Walkin' \").\n\nBlue turns to Gwendolyn Holmes, admitting that she has never felt attraction to boys, particularly not the one she is currently dating, but Gwendolyn does not help. The girls take a quiz regarding their love life, but it is revealed that Blue's true love is a woman named Penelope, and that Green has feelings for one man, whom she wants to marry (\" I Couldn't Live Without Your Love \"). Yellow reveals that her husband, a Paul McCartney lookalike, is hitting her, and she now has a baby on the way, but Gwendolyn tells her that she should go to a marriage counsellor rather than breaking it off.\n\nBlue and Orange sing about their own loves (\" You're My World \" / \"All I See Is You\").\n\nIt is now the 1970s (\" Those Were The Days \"). Orange gets Gwendolyn fired, and they celebrate (\" Shout! \"). In the end, they discuss their futures (Orange replaced Gwendolyn, Red became a teacher, Blue became an actress, Green became an airline stewardess, and Yellow became an abuse counsellor), and they are glad to have been a part of the 1960s (\" Goin' Back \" / \" Downtown \").",

        "description": "Metropolis is a musical based on the 1927 silent movie of the same name that was staged at the Piccadilly Theatre in London in 1989. The music was written by Joe Brooks , the lyrics by Dusty Hughes . The show was directed by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Savary . The cast included Judy Kuhn , Brian Blessed , Graham Bickley , Jonathan Adams , Paul Keown and Stifyn Parri. The musical marked the London debut of Judy Kuhn , who left the show shortly before the end of its run to be replaced by Mary Lincoln. The production was notable for its set design by Ralph Koltai.\n\nAfter that time Joe Brooks worked with American Randy Bowser at editing the already finished musical. By 2002 they had created a more complete libretto to the show, and it was first produced at the Pentacle Theater in Salem, Oregon.\n\nA new 5 star production, the very first London Revival, was announced on 13 September 2017, which was performed at the Ye Olde Rose and Crown Theatre, from 10 October 2017 to 5 November 2017.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe city of Metropolis - around the year 2000. It is the invention of John Freeman who now runs it like a despot, a city that exists in a world of perpetual night, a world that has had its energy resources exhausted. Metropolis is a beautiful experiment but it too is doomed because the only source of energy to power the city is human energy, which is harnessed ruthlessly for the benefit of the Elitists who live above. The workers operate vast machines below the city and power the privileged lives of the upper class on the surface of the city. Workers are forbidden to read and to learn, and they never see daylight. Among the workers who toil below is Maria who holds onto the memory of the world with a sun, flowers, birds and trees. She risks her life by giving clandestine lessons to the children of the workers so that the memory will never die and in the hope that someday freedom may soon be possible. Accidental deaths are frequent and when Jade\u2014girlfriend of worker 11811, George\u2014is mutilated and dies in the cogs of the machinery, Maria believes that the time is ripe for the children to be shown the world above. John Freeman's son, Steven, the heir apparent to Metropolis does not share his father's vision of total power: he has a conscience and his father, aware of this, attempts to keep Steven in ignorance of the appalling conditions in which the workers live and toil in the underworld.\n\nMaria and her band of children briefly escape from the underground and she and Steven meet fleetingly. He is haunted by her innocence and beauty and wonders whether these thoughts could possibly be love. He follows her into the depths of the underworld and so that he might experience for himself the conditions of life as a worker - and to be near Maria - he changes clothes with George and ends up at one of the machines while George, unrecognised, finds his way to the upper levels to be with the Elitists. Steven follows Maria and discovers that she is the spiritual leader of the workers. His journey, however, has not gone unnoticed by his father and Freeman's valet Jeremiah. A plan is devised to eliminate Maria and to subjugate the workers further. The scientist Warner has come close to perfecting a robot that is designed to replace the workers. His prototype robot is called Futura and only needs a face to be complete. Maria is kidnapped and her face is ingeniously copied and reconstructed onto the robot. Futura, obedient only to John Freeman's commands, is sent, as Maria, to the underworld to persuade the workers to work even harder and to allow the children to work the machines.\n\n### Act II\n\nWarner, like Steven, is overwhelmed by Maria's innocence and agrees to set her free. His duplicity is discovered and Warner is executed for his act of treason but Maria is free to lead the workers again. In the underworld, Futura malfunctions and, intending to kill Steven, murders George who, disguised as Steven has returned. The workers recognise Futura to be the work of the devil, i.e. Freeman, and throw her into the furnace. At the moment of Futura's destruction, Maria returns. The workers rebel and threaten to destroy Metropolis by attacking the machines, but without energy Metropolis cannot survive. Maria and Steven lead the workers to the relative safety of the upper world. John Freeman hears that his son has been killed by Futura and that it and his beloved machines have been destroyed. He becomes insane with rage and grief and blows up the control room of the city, killing himself and his right-hand man Jeremiah in the conflagration. The future is now in the hands of Steven and Maria as they lead the workers and children into the light as the city, no longer supported by their hard labor, collapses.",

Directed by Godspell co-creator John-Michael Tebelak , with book and lyrics by Bruce Kluger and music by Joe Ercole, the two-act musical told the story of the five sole survivors of a nuclear holocaust that had destroyed the world, who were spared by God so that he could audition them for his new show, Creation, Part Two.",
        "synopsis": "Ka-Boom! opens with its characters on their knees, singing in prayer. We quickly discover that they are the five sole survivors of a nuclear war that has destroyed all of humanity. They are: Tony, a showy Las Vegas lounge singer who was performing at the Sands Hotel when the blast hit; Jasmine, a cynical writer whose resume included jobs at The New Yorker and The Village Voice ; Hattie, a stripper who was dancing at her burlesque club, The Ka-Boom Room, when the world ended; June, a perky musical-comedy performer who'd just wrapped up her 17th national tour of Oklahoma! ; and Matthew, a confused drama student struggling with his identity. Eventually, a fussy angel (Avery) appears and explains to them that they are to audition for God for his planned second Creation , and that, through their performances, they must demonstrate that they can fulfill God's vision of a new and better world. Most of the play's action revolves around the quintet's efforts to stage a group audition, though their first attempts fail, as the characters succumb to their old vices, such as pride and selfishness. Eventually, the five create an entirely new audition piece that reveals the ways in which they have learned and grown. Avery returns, reveals that he is, in fact, God, and announces that all five survivors have earned their place in the new Creation.",

        "title": "Marie Christine",
        "description": "Marie Christine is a musical with music, lyrics, and book by Michael John LaChiusa . It opened on Broadway in 1999. While loosely based on the Greek play Medea , it is set in the 1890s, in New Orleans and Chicago, and draws heavily on the biographies of (and the mythology about) a historical mother and daughter, both named Marie Laveau , who were famous practitioners of voodoo .",
        "synopsis": "In New Orleans in 1899, Marie Christine, a racially mixed woman, is in prison without a trial to face death. The prisoners ask her to tell her story (\"Before the Morning\"). Three of the prisoners, acting as a Greek chorus , follow her as she tells of her mother, also named Marie Christine, who was a practitioner of voodoo magic and used it to help people who believed in the craft (\"Mamzell' Marie\"). Her mother warned her that although they know magic, they are still human and can make great mistakes (\"Ton Grandp\u00e8re est le Soleil (Your Grandfather Is the Sun)\")\n\nIn 1894, Marie meets Dante Keyes at Blue Rose Park on Lake Pontchartrain , just outside of New Orleans (\"Beautiful\"). She is instantly drawn to him, although he is a white sea captain who, while charming, is often rude (\"In An Instant\").\n\nMarie tells him of her two brothers, Jean and Paris, who are her caretakers since both her parents are dead. Their mother is held in low esteem in the brothers' eyes, due to her use of magic, which they disapprove of. Their white father left their mother and had Paris and Jean work as his servants, which made them quite wealthy. The brothers also have care of the dowry left to Marie, and they want her to marry a man worthy of her. Marie feels trapped by them. Jean is having a party later in the month to celebrate his engagement to Beatrice, a woman of class and stature befitting a man of his social standing. Both brothers are leaving for a month to resolve other matters. After they leave, Marie confides in her maid, Lisette, that women can control men if they know how (\"Way Back to Paradise\").\n\nMarie is increasingly enthralled by Dante (\"When You Look At a Man\"), who arrogantly tells of his skills as a sea captain (\"The Storm\"). His ship being driven off course by a storm, its cargo of fruit has spoiled due to the time lost. He is trying to get the money he and his crew are owed, and Marie offers to get it for him. She reveals her magic and how, like her mother, she helps those who ask her for her services (\"C'est L'Amour\" / \"To Find a Lover\"). Dante is skeptical of magic, and tells her of his travels (\"Nothing Beats Chicago\"). Marie has never left New Orleans and wishes to explore the world. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Dante reveals the loneliness of life at sea, although when he is on land, he hears the ocean calling to him (\"Ocean Is Different\"). To cover up his inner feelings, Dante tells Marie of his sexual exploits, and as they dance, he seduces her and they make love in the park (\"Danced With a Girl\").  Lisette attempts to find Marie (\"Tout Mi Mi\") and Marie realizes that Dante could be her means of escaping her confining life. An apparition of her mother warns her of the dangers of giving into her passions (\"Miracles and Mysteries\"). Lisette discovers Marie and Dante together (\"Tout Mi Mi (Reprise)\") and Marie sharply orders her away. Marie invites Dante to live in her guest house while her brothers are away, and Dante reveals that he can no longer hear the ocean calling to him, as he has fallen in love with Marie (\"I Don't Hear the Ocean\").\n\nA month later, Marie's servants gossip in code about Dante (\"Bird Inside the House\"). Paris and Jean return home and confront Marie about Dante. The town is abuzz with the scandal, and they implore her to send him away. She refuses, and Paris harshly reminds her of how their own father forced them to be servants. Paris leaves, and, alone with Marie, Jean pleads with his sister (\"All Eyes Look Upon You\"). She agrees to his wishes and rushes out.\n\nLisette walks in on the servants gossiping about Dante's imminent departure and Marie's newly-discovered pregnancy. As the servants leave, Dante corners Lisette and attempts to seduce her (\"Danced With a Girl (Reprise)\"). As Lisette, attempting to foil Dante's advances, reveals (in French) Marie's pregnancy, Marie walks in, commands Lisette to leave, and tells Dante (who, not understanding French, still does not know that Marie is carrying his child) that he must take her with him. He initially refuses, but she reveals that she has the key to Jean's study, where her dowry is kept, so Dante agrees to bring the ship closer and return on the night of Jean's engagement party, when they will steal the money and escape to Chicago (\"We're Gonna Go to Chicago\"). That night, Marie finds Lisette (\"Never Fall Under the Spell\" / \"Dansez Calinda\") and vengefully casts a spell that kills her. Marie is completely in love with Dante and will do anything for him (\"And You Would Lie\" / \"I Will Give\").\n\nAt the engagement party, Marie and Dante are caught and Paris and Jean beat Dante. To save him, Marie stabs and kills Paris. Marie and Dante escape to the docks, and as they sail away, Marie wordlessly reveals that she is pregnant (\"Finale of Act I\").\n\nMarie and Dante now have two boys and have been sailing happily along the Eastern seaboard for five years (\"Opening (Five Years Up and Down the Coast)\" / \"I Will Love You\"). They finally start a home in Chicago, where Dante, always ambitious, becomes interested in entering politics. At a brothel run by Magdalena (\"Cincinnati\"), Dante, advised by political boss Charles Gates, campaigns for the position of alderman (\"You're Looking at the Man\").\n\nDante leaves Marie and becomes engaged to Charles Gates' daughter Helena. Dante wants to have custody of his children, but Marie will not allow it (\"The Scorpion\"). Dante wants Marie to leave Chicago, telling her that she will be well provided for. Marie has nowhere to go - she has killed her brother and has left her mark in New York due to Dante's gambling. She reveals how she cast a spell on the daughters of the man who cheated Dante to make them kill their father (\"Lover Bring Me Summer\"). Dante will not return to her, so she reminds him of her enduring love and her magic, which she can use for him or against him (\"Tell Me\").\n\nMagdalena meets Marie (\"Billy Was Sweet\" / \"There's a Rumor Going Round\") and offers to help her. Marie refuses her, but Magdalena advises her to give up her children now to give her more options. Magdalena can help Marie keep her boys if Marie will help Magdalena conceive a child, which she and her husband have been unable to do (\"Paradise Is Burning Down\"). That night, Marie uses her magic to entangle herself with Dante and Helena - although she is not physically there, they can feel her and they engage in a dangerous m\u00e9nage-\u00e0-trois (\"Prison In a Prison\").\nCharles Gates' workers find Marie at her home and tell her she must leave (\"Better and Best\"). Gates himself soon appears and, using force, convinces Marie to give her boys to him (\"Good Looking Woman\"). Marie is worried her children will end up servants like her brothers and decides to take Magdalena up on her offer (\"You Can Taste the Blood\").\n\nMarie is haunted by her family and Lisette, who tell her she has gone too far (\"No Turning Back\") and cannot return (\"Silver Mimosa\" / \"Before the Morning (Reprise)\"). Marie meets Dante and asks him to allow the boys to give Helena a wedding gift to show how well-brought-up they are. She admits that she will always love him, and that she is doomed to life alone, reliving her past and unable to change it (\"Beautiful (Reprise)\"). The boys will return to her after the wedding to say goodbye before they start their new life with Dante.\n\nMagdalena arrives with the boys and recounts the wedding (\"A Lovely Wedding\"). Marie gives her a gift that will allow her to conceive. Magdalena tells Marie that she has friends with whom Marie can stay, and that the boys will be brought to her within the month. Before they return to Dante, Marie wishes to bathe them, and she sings them a farewell lullaby. (\"I Will Love You (Reprise)\"). Dante runs in and reveals that the present Marie had given Helena turned out to be cursed and burned her alive (\"Your Name\"). Marie returns and Dante begs for his boys. He discovers that Marie has killed them. Horrified, Magdalena throws Marie's magic gift to the ground and runs away.\n\nBack at the prison, Marie's mother is heard, followed by the prisoners, who tell Marie that innocence has died by her hand. As dawn arrives, Marie's mother asks, \u201cIs love too small a pain for a woman?\u201d. Marie Christine walks towards the rising light and into the burning sun (\"Finale of Act II\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nWilliam Sheridan, a successful attorney, lives on Roosevelt Island with his wife Ginnie and their two children: 14-year-old Emma, an outspoken, independent-minded, and overweight girl who wants to be a lawyer more than anything, and 10-year-old Willie, whom William wants to follow in his footsteps. However all Willie wants is to be a tap dancer. The show opens on a typical morning with Ginnie preparing breakfast and preparing for the day and Emma and Willie arguing (\"Another Day\"). Later that day, Emma returns home from school, angry at her parents and the world for underestimating and mistreating her (\"Four Strikes Against Me\"). Ginnie's brother Dipsey Bates arrives for Willie's tap lesson. The kids urge him to tell stories about the old days when Ginnie, Dipsey and their late father Daddy Bates performed as a vaudeville trio (\"Class Act\"). The number ends as William returns home from work. Finding his study in disarray. He coolly greets Dipsey, for whom he has little use as a 33-year-old dancer. Dipsey exits, leaving William to examine the children's report cards. He pays scant attention to Emma's exceptional grades, but he is so disappointed by Willie's poor grades that he grounds him and forbids him from dancing.\n\nThree weeks later, Willie still has not been allowed to dance. He goes to the playground where he is taunted for dancing by Winslow, a local teenage bully. Emma arrives and defends Willie against Winslow, but she still admonishes him for dancing. Emma and Willie fight and complain about their parents before Emma leaves (\"They Never Hear What I Say\"). Willie expresses to Emma what dancing means to him (\"Dancing is Everything\"). Willie runs away to Manhattan in search of Dipsey (\"Crosstown\").\n\nDipsey is rehearsing his dancers for an industrial show for a shoe buyers' convention. The performance has been designed to showcase Dipsey's dancing and choreographic talents with which he hopes to impress the producers of an out-of-town Broadway tryout (\"Fabulous Feet\"). Willie arrives during the rehearsal and is uncontrollably drawn into the number, dancing with his uncle. The dancers are so amazed by Willie that they stop dancing and just let him perform. Excited by his nephew's potential, Dipsey rushes the boy home to tell his parents the good news. Dipsey's assistant Carole is left to continue the rehearsal. After the rehearsal, she reflects on her emotions for Dipsey (\"I Could Get Used to Him\").\n\nDipsey brings Willie back home and excitedly tells Ginnie and William of Willie's raw talent. William interrupts, furious because Willie ran away and risked his life by going alone to New York City. Sensing his authority slipping away due to Ginnie and Emma's protests, William lashes out and forbids Willie from tap dancing and seeing Dipsey. Willie, heartbroken, runs out onto the terrace, and Dipsey follows him and comforts him, telling him he'll have to dance inside of himself (\"Man in the Moon\").\n\n### Act II\n\nWillie has not danced for weeks and is miserable. During another breakfast in the Sheridan household, an argument ensues, and William storms out. Emma accuses her mother of not asserting herself nor caring enough about her children. Ginnie accuses Emma of being exactly like her father. They fight (\"Like Him\"). Dipsey and Carole, now dating and living together, wait in their loft to find out if Dipsey booked the out-of-town tryout in Buffalo, New York . Dipsey has just given up hope when the phone rings telling him he got the job. Dipsey and Carole celebrate, with Dipsey finally succeeding in life (\"My Luck Is Changing\").\n\nWillie has gone to the playground to be alone, and Emma comes looking for him. This time instead of arguing, they connect and dream about a day they are understood by their parents (\"Someday\").\n\nGinnie comes to Dipsey's loft, confused and upset, not knowing how to cheer up Willie. Dipsey tries to convince her to let Willie try out for a role in his new Buffalo show. Ginnie, knowing what the consequences might be, refuses. Echoing Emma's earlier sentiments, Dipsey accuses Ginnie of caring only about keeping her husband happy. Ginnie explains to Dipsey that William was not always like this, and that there is still good inside of him (\"I Remember How It Was\"). She goes to Willie's bedroom and warily tells him about his audition the next day for Dipsey's show. Willie is overjoyed. Ginnie tucks him in for the night and sings to her son until he falls asleep (\"Lullabye\").\n\nWillie dreams a wonderful dream starring his grandfather, wherein the following day, Willie auditions for the show. The bug of finally being on a stage propels Willie into a fantasy in which he is surrounded by all of Willie's idols, the great dancers Fred Astaire , Bojangles , Gene Kelly , The Nicholas Brothers , Dipsey and Daddy Bates. They dance with him in his dream (\"Dance If It Makes You Happy\").\n\nWillie auditions the next day and receives the part. Without celebration, Ginnie takes him and Emma to Dipsey and Carole's house to wait for William and prepare for his reaction to the news. William arrives, and when Ginnie tells him the news, he is outraged. The family is speechless and nervously cowers in front of William before Emma stands up to him. Her speech, coupling the courtroom savvy of a seasoned professional with the vulnerability of a hurt child, is a powerful indictment against William for alienation of affection and loss of aid to dependent children. Ginnie tells William that things cannot continue this way. She demands that she should be just as in charge of the family as he is. William explodes and in a frightening display, pours out his deep-rooted anguish and self-hatred to the family (\"William's Song\").\n\nLater, alone in front of Dipsey's building, William waits, not knowing what will happen. Emma joins him, and she and her father finally reach an understanding. Willie arrives and tells William that he is not taking the part in the show but still longs to be a dancer. Ginnie appears, followed by Dipsey, and they both make peace with William. They all compromise a little, but they will still remain together as a family (\"Class Act [Finale]\").",

        "description": "Florodora is an Edwardian musical comedy . After its long run in London, it became one of the first successful Broadway musicals of the 20th century. The book was written by Jimmy Davis under the pseudonym Owen Hall , the music was by Leslie Stuart with additional songs by Paul Rubens , and the lyrics were by Edward Boyd-Jones, George Arthurs and Rubens.\n\nThe original London production opened in 1899 where it ran for a very successful 455 performances. The New York production, which opened the following year, was even more popular, running for 552 performances. After this, the piece was produced throughout the English-speaking world and beyond. The musical  was famous for its double sextet and its chorus line of \"Florodora Girls\".\n\nThe piece was popular with amateur theatre groups, particularly in Britain, into the 1950s.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn Florodora, a small island in the Philippines , the popular fragrance \"Florodora\" is manufactured from the essence of the Florodora flower. The perfume factory, along with the island itself, is owned by Cyrus W. Gilfain, an American who finagled the business away from Dolores's family and is now the island's reigning sovereign and sole employer. Although Dolores is now forced to work for Gilfain, she remains optimistic. Frank Abercoed, who is really Lord Abercoed in disguise, has arrived on the island to act as Gilfain's manager. He is immediately smitten with Dolores, and she with him.\n\nAboard a ship docked at the Florodora harbor are Lady Holyrood, titled but penniless, who has come to Florodora at Gilfain's suggestion to find a husband \u2013 specifically, Frank. She is accompanied by Gilfain, his daughter Angela, who is betrothed to Captain Arthur Donegal, Lady Holyrood's brother, and several of Angela's friends (the \"English Girls\"), who intrigue Gilfain's clerks. Also aboard the ship is Anthony Tweedlepunch, a detective who is searching for the girl who rightfully owns the perfume business. He comes to the island disguised as a traveling showman, phrenologist , hypnotist, and palmist.\n\nGilfain discovers that Frank and Dolores have fallen in love. In an effort to thwart Dolores' rightful claim to the Florodora fortune, Gilfain plans to marry her himself. He hires Tweedlepunch, who he thinks is an actor, to break up the love affair between Dolores and Frank, thereby making Frank available to marry Angela. By presenting Tweedlepunch as a highly respected phrenologist, Gilfain plots to marry off his clerks to the heads of the Florodora farms (all young island girls), thereby attaining even more control of the island. Tweedlepunch plays along, duly examining everyone's cranial bumps of love to pronounce the proper marriage couples.\n\nFrank refuses to marry Angela, and Gilfain discharges him. Gilfain, based on the fraudulent pronouncements of Tweedlepunch, has decreed that the clerks will wed the island girls or be discharged. Everyone is upset. Frank must now return to England, and he tells Dolores he must go but will return for her if she waits patiently. Everyone meets at the dock to see Frank off.\n\n### Act II\n\nSix months later, Gilfain has managed to become the owner of Abercoed Castle, Frank's ancestral home in Wales, and everyone has travelled there. Gilfain's clerks, having been discharged rather than marry the island girls, finally meet up with their English girls (Angela's friends). Tweedlepunch has finally realized that Dolores is the rightful heir to the Florodora fortune. He tells her that her father was his only friend, and that he will help her retrieve her family business. They break into the Abercoed castle but are surprised by a chorus of lords and ladies who demand to know who they are. In desperation they try to convince everyone that they are the evening's entertainment.\n\nLady Holyrood, with no prospective husbands in sight, decides that Gilfain will become her next husband. Frank, who has been refused entrance to the castle by Gilfain, defies orders and maneuvers his way inside the courtyard. There he sees Dolores for the first time since he left the island. After some confusion, Frank tells Dolores that he is really Lord Abercoed and was unable to return to her in Florodora because he was trying to keep Gilfain from acquiring his ancestral home. Tweedlepunch finally confronts Gilfain and spins a wild ghost yarn that terrifies Gilfain into admitting that he has stolen the perfume business. Gilfain returns the properties he has taken from Dolores and Frank. Frank marries Dolores; Gilfain marries Lady Holyrood; and Angela marries Captain Donegal.",

        "synopsis": "The ponies of Equestria prepare for their first Friendship Festival, overseen by Princess Twilight Sparkle in Canterlot. The festivities are interrupted by an army of monsters commanded by the Unicorn Tempest Shadow, who is ordered by her superior, the Storm King, to capture Equestria's princesses and Twilight and empower his mystical staff with their magic in exchange for restoring her broken horn. Tempest uses magical orbs to petrify Twilight's fellow princesses and mentors Princess Celestia , Princess Luna , and Princess Cadence but Twilight escapes with her six friends: Pinkie Pie , Rainbow Dash , Rarity , Applejack , Fluttershy , and the dragon Spike .\n\nFollowing incomplete instructions from Celestia, Twilight and her friends set out to find the \"queen of the hippo\" beyond Equestria. They arrive at the desert city of Klugetown, where they accept an offer by a con artist feline named Capper to escort them to the \" hippos \", unaware that he intends to sell them to local mob boss Verko as to settle a debt he owes to him. As Capper begins to develop a genuine friendship with them, Twilight discovers an atlas that reveals the \"hippos\" to be hippogriffs . Just as they're about to leave, Verko arrives to buy them, exposing Capper's treachery. When Tempest arrives in pursuit of Twilight, the group evades her aboard a delivery airship run by birdlike pirates led by Captain Celaeno, whom Rainbow Dash persuades to take them to the hippogriffs' kingdom on Mount Aris. However, she accidentally gives their location away to Tempest with a Sonic Rainboom , forcing the group to reach Mount Aris in a makeshift hot-air balloon.\n\nWhile exploring the hippogriffs' deserted kingdom, Twilight's group is led by the seapony Princess Skystar to her home of Seaquestria in an underwater cavern. Skystar reveals her kind to be the hippogriffs, transformed by a magic pearl used by her mother, Queen Novo, to hide from the Storm King and his forces, which she denies giving to the group to use against the Storm King. Twilight, fed up with her friends' carefree antics throughout the journey, attempts to steal it while letting her friends unknowingly distract the seaponies. Her plan backfires when she triggers an alarm right after Pinkie persuades Novo to give them the pearl, resulting in Novo angrily banishing the entire group back to the surface.\n\nBack at the surface, Twilight and her friends get into an argument over her actions, ending with Twilight losing her temper and furiously disowning them as her friends while flaring her horn at Pinkie. Deeply hurt and offended, the group, barring Spike, leave Twilight, unknowingly allowing her to be finally captured by Tempest, who gains her sympathy as she reveals the loss of her own horn as a foal due to an Ursa Minor attack caused her own friends to leave her because of her unstable magic.\n\nUpon learning of her kidnapping from Spike, Twilight's friends immediately spring into action and return to Canterlot to rescue her with the help of a reformed Capper, Celaeno and the pirates, and Skystar, who have followed them after being inspired by their friendship. Using his newly empowered staff, the Storm King conjures a storm against the group and betrays Tempest, whom Twilight saves. Twilight and her friends quickly reconcile and manage to recover the staff, ending the storm. The Storm King hurls a magical orb to petrify the group, but Tempest jumps in his way, petrifying them both. The Storm King falls to the ground and smashes to pieces, while the group uses the staff to revive Tempest, who returns the stolen magic to the princesses, restoring them and repairing the now-damaged city. The Friendship Festival resumes with the ponies celebrating alongside everyone whom Twilight and her friends encountered and befriended on their adventure. Encouraged by Twilight, Tempest joins in by producing a fireworks display with her broken horn, and happily accepts the group's friendship.",

        "title": "Pal Joey (musical)",
        "description": "Pal Joey is a 1940 musical with a book by John O'Hara and music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart . The musical is based on a character and situations O'Hara created in a series of short stories published in The New Yorker , which he later published in novel form. The title character, Joey Evans, is a manipulative small-time nightclub performer whose ambitions lead him into an affair with the wealthy, middle-aged and married Vera Simpson. It includes two songs that have become standards : \" I Could Write a Book \" and \" Bewitched (Bothered And Bewildered) \".\n\nThe original 1940 Broadway production was directed by George Abbott and starred Vivienne Segal and Gene Kelly . Though it received mixed reviews, the show ran for 10 months, the third-longest run of any Rodgers and Hart musical. There have been several revivals since, including a 2008\u201309 Broadway run, and a 1957 film adaptation starring Frank Sinatra , Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak .",
        "synopsis": "Based on original 1940 book\n\nIn Chicago in the late 1930s, singer/dancer Joey Evans, a charming \"heel\" with big plans, schemes to get his own nightclub. He auditions for an emcee job at a second-rate nightclub (\"You Mustn't Kick It Around\"). Joey gets the job and begins rehearsals with the chorus girls and club singer Gladys Bumps. Joey meets young and na\u00efve Linda English outside a pet shop, and he impresses her with grandiose lies about his career. Linda innocently falls for Joey's line (\" I Could Write a Book \"). As the chorus girls are doing a song-and-dance number at the club that night (\"Chicago\"), Linda arrives with a date. Wealthy married socialite Vera Simpson arrives at the club and shows a definite interest in Joey. Joey plays hard-to-get and insults Vera, who walks out. Mike, the club owner, fires Joey, but Joey, believing Vera will be back, strikes a deal: if Vera doesn't come back within the next few days, Joey will leave without pay. The chorus girls continue with the show (\"That Terrific Rainbow\"); Linda, having witnessed Joey's caddish behavior, has left the club. Vera doesn't return, so Joey is fired. When Linda refuses to answer his calls, Joey calls Vera (\"What is a Man\"). After Joey's last night as emcee, Vera picks him up from the club and they start an affair (\"Happy Hunting Horn\"). Vera is glowing in the romance and sets Joey up with an apartment and expensive clothes (\" Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered \"). While shopping for clothes for Joey, he and Vera run into Linda, leaving Vera jealous and Linda distraught. Vera gives Joey his own nightclub, \"Chez Joey\", and Joey looks forward to rising to the top (\"Pal Joey\"/\"Joey Looks to the Future\" ballet).\n\nThe chorus girls and singers from the old club have relocated to \"Chez Joey\", where they rehearse for the opening performance (\"The Flower Garden of My Heart\"). Melba, an ambitious reporter, interviews Joey, recalling her interviews with various celebrities\u2014including Gypsy Rose Lee (\"Zip\"), especially notable since the original actor playing Gladys, June Havoc , was Lee's real-life sister. Ludlow Lowell, Gladys' old flame, introduces himself as an agent with papers that Joey unthinkingly signs as the rehearsal continues (\"Plant You Now, Dig You Later\"). In Joey's apartment the next morning, Joey and Vera reflect on the pleasures of their affair (\"In Our Little Den\"). Linda overhears Gladys and Lowell plotting to use the papers Joey signed to blackmail Vera.  Linda calls Vera, who initially distrusts Linda; Vera confronts Joey, asking what his relationship is with Linda, and Joey responds defensively (\"Do It the Hard Way\"). Linda comes to the apartment to convince Vera, and Vera, seeing Linda's sincerity, now believes her. Vera and Linda agree that Joey is not worth the trouble (\"Take Him\"). Vera calls her friend the police commissioner, who arrests Gladys and Lowell. Vera throws Joey out and closes \"Chez Joey\" (\"Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered\" reprise). Joey, now penniless, runs into Linda again outside the pet shop, and she invites him to dinner with her family. He joins for a meal and then they part as friends, with him claiming to have been cast in a nonexistent show in New York.\n\n### Principal roles and notable performers",

One night, he sees Connie's duplicitous boyfriend Rocky negotiating with a pair of gangsters and accidentally disrupts it by dropping a bone into the meeting. Thinking Rocky is an undercover cop setting them up, the gangsters flee as their boss tells Rocky that he has blown his last chance as he claims that it was a \"stupid dog\" that intruded.\n\nWhen Connie goes on tour for two weeks, she leaves Rover in the care of Rocky. In retaliation for ruining his deal, Rocky stuffs Rover in a bag, drives him to Hoover Dam and throws him into the water.\n\nThe bag is later pulled out of the water by two passing fishermen , who take Rover back to shore and place him in the back of their pickup truck . Rover regains consciousness, jumps out of the truck during a stop, and begins wandering down the road. He ends up in the countryside, and encounters a farmer named Cal and his son Danny. Danny convinces his father to take the dog in. Cal agrees on one condition: if he causes trouble, he will be sent to an animal shelter . Rover has difficulty adjusting to life on the farm but with the help of Daisy, a beautiful collie next door, and the other dogs on the farm, he succeeds in earning their trust. Rover spends Christmas with the family, and begins to fall in love with Daisy.\n\nA pack of wolves attempt to kill a turkey on the farm. Rover saves the turkey, but the bird ends up dead from shock.

Infuriated, Rocky tries to retaliate, but Rover and friends chase him out of the casino, where he is beckoned into the gangsters' limo. When Rocky thanks them, the Big Boss quotes \"This is a set up! Want to see Hoover Dam\"? The limo then drives off as Rover waves goodbye.\n\nSometime later, Rover becomes despondent upon missing Daisy. Understanding that he misses his new life, Connie takes Rover back to the farm to stay, allowing Cal and Danny to keep him. Rover is reunited with Daisy, who leads him to the barn, revealing that he is now a father of six puppies: five of them resembling Rover and one resembling Daisy.

The setting of the plot is relocated to 1970s Saigon during the Vietnam War , and Madama Butterfly ' s story of marriage between an American lieutenant and a geisha is replaced by a romance between a United States Marine and a seventeen-year-old South Vietnamese bargirl .\n\nThe musical premiered at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane , London , on 20 September 1989, closing after 4,092 performances on 30 October 1999.

As of January 2026, Miss Saigon remains Broadway's fifteenth longest-running show .",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nIn April 1975 at \"Dreamland\", a Saigon bar and brothel, shortly before the end of the Vietnam War , it is Kim's first day as a bargirl . The seventeen-year-old peasant girl is hauled in by the Engineer, a French-Vietnamese hustler who owns the joint. Backstage, the girls ready themselves for the night's show, jeering at Kim's inexperience (\"Overture / Backstage Dreamland\"). The U.S. Marines, aware that they will soon be leaving Vietnam, party with the Vietnamese sex workers (\"The Heat Is on in Saigon\"). Chris Scott, a sergeant disenchanted by the club scene, is encouraged by his friend John Thomas to go with a girl.\n\nThe girls compete for the title of \"Miss Saigon\", and the winner is raffled to a Marine. Kim's guilelessness strikes Chris. Gigi Van Tranh wins the crown for the evening and begs the marine who won the raffle to take her back to America, annoying him. The showgirls reflect on their dreams of a better life (\"Movie in My Mind\"). John buys a room for Chris and the virgin Kim (\"The Transaction\"). Kim is reluctant and shy, but dances with Chris, who tries to pay her to leave the nightclub. When the Engineer interferes, thinking that Chris does not like Kim, Chris allows himself to be led to her room (\"The Dance\").\n\nChris, watching Kim sleep, asks God why he met her just as he was about to leave Vietnam (\"Why, God, Why?\"). When Kim wakes up, Chris tries to give her money, but she refuses, saying that it is her first time sleeping with a man (\"This Money's Yours\"). Touched to learn that Kim is an orphan, Chris offers to take her to America with him, and the two fall in love (\"Sun and Moon\"). Chris tells John that he is taking leave to spend time with Kim. John warns him that the Viet Cong will soon take Saigon, but then reluctantly agrees to cover for Chris (\"The Telephone Song\"). Chris meets with the Engineer to trade for Kim, but the Engineer tries to include an American visa in the deal. Threatening the Engineer at gunpoint, Chris forces him to honor the original arrangement for Kim (\"The Deal\").\n\nThe bargirls hold a \"wedding ceremony\" for Chris and Kim (\"Dju Vui Vai\"), with Gigi toasting Kim as the \"real\" Miss Saigon. Thuy, Kim's cousin, to whom she was betrothed at thirteen, arrives to take her home. He has since become an officer in the North Vietnamese Army and is disgusted to find her with a white man (\"Thuy's Arrival\"). The two men confront each other, drawing their firearms. Kim tells Thuy that their arranged marriage is now nullified because her parents are dead, and she no longer harbors any feelings for him because of his betrayal. Thuy curses them all and storms out (\"What's This I Find\"). Chris promises to take Kim with him when he leaves Vietnam. Chris and Kim dance to the same song as on their first night (\"Last Night of The World\").\n\nThree years later, in 1978, a street parade is taking place in Saigon (since renamed Ho Chi Minh City ) to celebrate the third anniversary of the reunification of Vietnam and the defeat of the Americans (\"The Morning of The Dragon\"). Thuy, now a commissar in the new Communist government, has ordered his soldiers to look for the still-corrupt Engineer. For the Communist Party, he goes by the name \"Tran Van Dinh\" and has spent the past three years working in the rice fields as part of a re-education program. Thuy orders the Engineer to find Kim and bring her to him. Although the intervening period is not shown, it is apparent that Kim and Chris have become separated in the three year time jump. Kim has been hiding in an impoverished area, still in love with Chris and steadfastly believing that Chris will return to Vietnam and rescue her. Meanwhile, Chris is in bed with his new American wife, Ellen, when he wakes from a dream shouting Kim's name. Ellen and Kim both swear their devotion to Chris from opposite ends of the world (\"I Still Believe\").\n\nThe Engineer takes Thuy to where Kim has been hiding. Kim refuses Thuy's renewed offer of marriage, unaware that his men are waiting outside the door. Furious, Thuy calls them in and they begin tying up Kim and the Engineer, threatening to put them into a re-education camp (\"Coo-Coo Princess\"), before Thuy orders them out and allows the Engineer to leave. Again, Kim refuses to go with Thuy and shocks him by introducing Thuy to Tam, her three-year-old son from Chris. Thuy calls Kim a traitor and Tam an enemy, and tries to kill Tam with a knife, but Kim is forced to shoot Thuy to protect Tam (\"You Will Not Touch Him\"). Thuy dies as the street parade continues nearby (\"This Is the Hour\"), with Kim showing horror and heartbreak at her action, before fleeing with Tam.\n\nThe Engineer laments being born Vietnamese and wishes to go to the US (\"If You Want to Die in Bed\"). Kim tells the Engineer what she has done, and he learns that Tam's father is American (\"Let Me See His Western Nose\") \u2013 thinking the boy is his chance to emigrate to the United States . He tells Kim that now he is the boy's uncle, and he will lead them to Bangkok . As Kim swears to Tam that she would do anything to give him a better life, the three set out on a ship with other refugees (\"I'd Give My Life for You\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nIn Atlanta , Georgia, John now works for an aid organization whose mission is to connect Bui-Doi (from Vietnamese tr\u1ebb b\u1ee5i \u0111\u1eddi \"street children,\" meaning children conceived during the war) with their American fathers (\"Bui Doi\"). John tells Chris that Kim is still alive, which Chris is relieved to hear after years of having nightmares of her dying. He also tells Chris about Tam and urges Chris to go to Bangkok with Ellen, and Chris then finally tells Ellen about Kim and Tam (\"The Revelation\"). In Bangkok, the Engineer is hawking a sleazy club where Kim works as a dancer (\"What A Waste\"). Chris, Ellen, and John arrive in search of Kim. John finds Kim dancing at the club and tells her that Chris is also in Bangkok. He then tries to tell her that Chris is remarried, but Kim interrupts. She is thrilled about the news and tells Tam that his father has arrived, believing that they are to go to America with Chris. Seeing Kim happy, John cannot bring himself to break the news to her but promises to bring Chris to her (\"Please\").\n\nThe Engineer tells Kim to find Chris herself because he doubts that Chris will come (\"Chris Is Here\"). Kim is haunted by the ghost of Thuy, who taunts Kim, claiming that Chris will betray her as he did the night Saigon fell. Kim suffers a horrible flashback to that night (\"Kim's Nightmare\").\n\nIn the nightmare and flashback to 1975, Kim remembers the Viet Cong approaching Saigon. As the city becomes increasingly chaotic, Chris is called to the embassy and leaves his gun with Kim, telling her to pack. When Chris enters the embassy, the gates close, as orders arrive from Washington for an immediate evacuation of the remaining Americans. The Ambassador orders that no more Vietnamese be allowed into the Embassy. Kim reaches the gates of the Embassy, one in a crowd of terrified Vietnamese trying to enter. Chris calls to Kim and is about to go into the crowd to look for her. John is eventually forced to punch Chris in the face to stop him from leaving. Chris is put into the last helicopter leaving Saigon as Kim watches from outside, still pledging her love to him (\"The Fall of Saigon\").\n\nBack in 1978 Bangkok, Kim joyfully dresses in her wedding clothes (\"Sun and Moon [Reprise]\") and leaves the Engineer to watch Tam while she is gone. She goes to Chris's hotel room, where she finds Ellen. Ellen reveals that she is Chris's wife. While Kim is heartbroken and initially in denial about the truth, she soon confirms to Ellen that Tam is Chris's son, and says that she does not want her son to continue living on the streets, pleading that they take Tam with them back to America, but Ellen refuses, saying that Tam needs his real mother, and Ellen wants her own children with Chris. Kim angrily demands that Chris tell her these things in person, and runs out of the room (\"Room 317\"). Ellen feels bad for Kim, but is determined to keep Chris (\"Now That I've Seen Her/Maybe\").\n\nChris and John return, having failed to find Kim. Ellen tells them both that Kim arrived and that she had to tell Kim everything. Chris and John blame themselves, realizing that they were gone too long. Ellen also tells them that Kim wants to see Chris at her place and that she tried to give away her son to them. John realizes that Kim wants Tam to be \"an American boy.\" Ellen then issues an ultimatum to Chris: Kim or her. Chris reassures Ellen, and they pledge their love for each other. Chris and Ellen agree to leave Tam and Kim in Bangkok but offer them monetary support from America, while John decries their decision as selfish (\"The Confrontation\"). Back at the club, Kim tells the Engineer that they are still going to America (\"Paper Dragons\"). The Engineer imagines the extravagant new life that he will lead in America (\"The American Dream\"). Chris, John, and Ellen find the Engineer and he takes them to see Kim and Tam.\n\nIn her room, Kim tells Tam that he should be happy because he now has a father. She tells him that she cannot go with him but will be watching over him (\"This Is the Hour [Reprise]\"). Chris, Ellen, John, and the Engineer arrive just outside her room. The Engineer comes in to take Tam outside to introduce him to his father. While this is happening, Kim steps behind a curtain and shoots herself. As she falls to the floor, Chris rushes into the room at the sound of the gunshot and finds Kim mortally wounded. He picks up Kim and asks what she has done. Replying that the gods guided him to his son, Kim asks Chris to hold her once more and they share one last kiss. Kim then repeats something that he said to her on the first night they met: \"How in one night have we come so far?\", and dies in Chris's arms as everyone watches (\"Finale\").",

        "synopsis": "Act One opens in 1520 at the Field of Cloth of Gold in Calais , France, a peace treaty organized by Cardinal Wolsey, Archbishop of York.  Henry VIII, king of England is there with his wife, Catherine of Aragon, daughter Mary and a large part of his court, including his fool , Will Somers, and the court musician Mark Smeaton with whom he shares his latest song composition, \u201cNo Song More Pleasing\u201d which charms and delights everyone present.\n\nAt the meeting with King Francis of France, Henry meets Anne Boleyn and immediately becomes smitten with her.  Having failed to produce a male heir with his wife Catherine (\u201cWhere is My Son?\u201d), Henry considers divorcing her and marrying Anne.  Henry's court astrologer Comus, along with Will Somers, Mark Smeaton and Cardinal Wolsey humorously lament Henry's notorious wandering eye in \u201cThe Chase\u201d leaving Henry to pluck the petals from a daisy to prophesize the outcome of his desire for Anne.  Catherine refuses to grant Henry a divorce, so Henry founds the Church of England , and thus divorces and banishes Catherine.\n\nPassionately in love, Henry and Anne admit that they cannot bear to be \u201cAway From You\u201d, but after their marriage, things sour when Anne gives birth, not to a son, but to daughter \u201cElizabeth.\u201d  Things become further strained as Anne becomes intrigued with Mark Smeaton, and Henry with Jane Seymour, one of Anne's ladies-in-waiting.  Charges of treason against Anne and Smeaton are laid and they are found guilty.  Shortly before her execution, Anne and Henry reflect on their time together, \u201cSo Much You Loved Me.\u201d  Will promises Anne that he will look after Elizabeth.  Henry marries Jane Seymour and they have a son together, Edward, but Jane dies in childbirth, leaving Henry conflicted as he rejoices in the arrival of his son, but questioning his methods in this pursuit.\n\nAct Two opens 10 years later.  Since the end of Act One, Henry has had three more wives: Anne of Cleves (divorced) and Catherine Howard (executed) and is now married to Katharine Parr, a matronly widow, who satisfies the elder Henry's need for companionship in his later years.  Edward is now a child of 10, Elizabeth is a healthy young woman and, joined by their half-sister, Mary, they celebrate \u201cChristmas at Hampton Court.\u201d  Francis of France arrives to discuss the terms for peace at the holiday and brings Henry a gift:  pear trees from Anjou, a rare fruit which comes to fruition once every ten years.  Following a ferocious altercation with Elizabeth, Henry realizes that he admires her regal courage and that Elizabeth is the \"son\" he never had; but to love and admire her duly, it must be \u201cFrom Afar\u201d and he banishes her from the kingdom.  Will Somers cheers Elizabeth up, and then proceeds to humorously torment Comus who is in the course of charting the worst prediction of his career:  Edward will not live to maturity and Elizabeth will become a great leader.

Frank Baum , it was primarily directed by Victor Fleming , who left production to take over the troubled Gone with the Wind . The screenplay is credited to Noel Langley , Florence Ryerson , and Edgar Allan Woolf , but includes contributions from other writers. The film stars Judy Garland , Frank Morgan , Ray Bolger , Jack Haley , Bert Lahr , Billie Burke , and Margaret Hamilton . The music was composed by Harold Arlen and adapted by Herbert Stothart , with lyrics by Edgar \"Yip\" Harburg .\n\nThe film is celebrated for its use of three-strip Technicolor , fantasy storytelling, musical score, and memorable characters. It was a critical success and was nominated for five Academy Awards , including Best Picture , winning Best Original Song for \" Over the Rainbow \" and Best Original Score for Stothart; an Academy Juvenile Award was presented to Judy Garland. It was on a preliminary list of submissions from the studios for an Academy Award for Cinematography (Color) but was not nominated. While it was sufficiently popular at the box office, it failed to make a profit until its 1949 re-release, earning only $3 million on a $2.7 million budget, making it MGM's most expensive production at the time.\n\nThe 1956 television broadcast premiere of the film on CBS reintroduced it to the public. According to the U.S. Library of Congress , it is the most seen film in cinematic history. In the inaugural class of 1989, it was selected by the Library of Congress as one of the first 25 films for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".

        "synopsis": "Dorothy Gale lives on a Kansas farm with her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em . Her dog Toto is seized by neighbor Almira Gulch, who has obtained a sheriff's order after being bitten by him. Toto escapes and returns to Dorothy, who runs away to protect him. Professor Marvel, a charlatan fortune teller, leads Dorothy to believe that Aunt Em is sick with heartbreak, which prompts Dorothy to return home. She returns just as a tornado approaches the farm. Unable to get into the locked storm cellar , she takes cover in the farmhouse and is knocked unconscious while inside. She seemingly awakens to find the house moving through the air, with her and Toto still inside it. Various figures float by, including Gulch, who morphs into a witch.\n\nThe house comes down in an unknown land, which turns out to be Munchkinland in the Land of Oz . Dorothy is greeted by a good witch named Glinda , who informs her that the house landed on the Wicked Witch of the East , killing her. The Munchkins celebrate the wicked witch's death, until her sister, the Wicked Witch of the West , shows up. Before she can seize her deceased sister's ruby slippers , Glinda magically transports them onto Dorothy's feet and tells her to keep them on. The wicked witch leaves, but swears vengeance upon Dorothy and Toto. Glinda tells Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City , the home of the Wizard of Oz , as he might know how to help her return home.\n\nAlong the way, Dorothy meets the Scarecrow , who wants a brain; the Tin Man , who wants a heart; and the Cowardly Lion , who wants courage. They reach the Emerald City, despite the efforts of the Wicked Witch. The wizard appears as a giant ghostly head and tells them he will grant their wishes if they bring him the Wicked Witch's broom.\n\nDuring their quest, Dorothy and Toto are captured by flying monkeys and taken to the Wicked Witch's castle. Toto escapes, and leads the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion to the castle. They free Dorothy, but are pursued and finally cornered by the Witch and her guards, the Winkies. She taunts them and sets fire to the Scarecrow's arm. When Dorothy throws a bucket of water onto him, she inadvertently splashes the Witch, causing her to melt away. The Winkies gratefully give Dorothy the Witch's broom. The group returns to the Wizard, but he tells them to come back the next day. They protest, and Toto pulls back a curtain, revealing the \"Wizard\" to be an ordinary man operating machinery. When they confront him, he confesses to being a humbug , but \"grants\" Dorothy's friends' wishes by giving them tokens to confirm that they had the qualities they sought.\n\nThe Wizard reveals that he, like Dorothy, is from Kansas and accidentally arrived in Oz in a hot air balloon. When he offers to take her back to Kansas with him aboard it, she accepts, but Toto jumps out of her arms and she goes after him, and the balloon accidentally lifts off with just the Wizard aboard. Glinda then reappears and tells Dorothy she always had the power to return to Kansas using the ruby slippers, but had to find that out for herself. After sharing a tearful farewell with her friends, Dorothy clicks her heels three times and repeats, \"There's no place like home.\"\n\nDorothy awakens in her own bed in Kansas. She recounts her adventures, but Aunt Em says that she just had a bad dream. Dorothy tells Professor Marvel and the farmhands that they were in Oz also, and they smile, humoring her. As she hugs Toto, she gratefully exclaims, \"Oh, Auntie Em, there's no place like home!\"",

        "synopsis": "Sharpay Evans ( Ashley Tisdale ) performs a dance number at the Lava Springs Country Club (\"Gonna Shine\"). There, she meets famous producer and casting director Jerry Taylor ( Pat Mastroianni ), who offers her a chance to star in his newest show on Broadway. Sharpay asks her father, Vance ( Robert Curtis Brown ), to let her move to New York City on her own. He hesitantly accepts, but he has a condition; if the plan backfires and she is not in a show by the end of the month, Sharpay will need to move back with her parents and work at Lava Springs. In New York, Sharpay is kicked out of her penthouse because they do not allow dogs and she refuses to part with her own dog, Boi.\n\nWhile moping on the street, she meets Peyton Leverett ( Austin Butler ), an aspiring film director and son of Sharpay's mother's friend from college. He offers her a studio apartment if she will be the subject of his film project. Sharpay accepts but is distraught when she realizes life in New York is not as glamorous as it was back home. To make her feel better, Peyton takes her to the stage of a Broadway theatre, which inspires her to make the best of the situation. The next day, Sharpay heads to her audition, only to discover that Jerry only wanted to audition Boi for the part of the \"best friend\" in his new musical, A Girl's Best Friend .\n\nShe becomes discouraged, but with the help of Peyton, she auditions him (\"My Boi and Me\"), only to be caught in a tie with the very competitive child star Roger Elliston ( Bradley Steven Perry ) and his pedigree Cavalier King Charles Spaniel , Countess (\"My Girl and Me\"). Later, Sharpay meets Broadway star Amber Lee Adams ( Cameron Goodman ), the star of the show, whom Sharpay admires. Rehearsals begin the next morning with the directors Gill Samms ( Alec Mapa ) and Neal Roberts ( Jack Plotnick ) using both dogs interchangeably to determine which one will get the role.\n\nAfter rehearsals, Amber Lee fires her assistant and hires Sharpay, who accepts in the hope it will help Boi get chosen. Later, by pretending to be Sharpay's friend and implying that Boi will get the part, Amber Lee convinces Sharpay to be her maid. Boi and Countess run away together, madly in love, and enjoy a jaunt around the city (\"Baby\"). Sharpay and Roger panic, finally uniting to find the dogs. Peyton finds them and returns them to the two new friends. At the end of the day, Peyton tells Sharpay the girl he met on the first day would trust in her own talents rather than sell her soul to get ahead, and they get in a fight. Sharpay finds out that Amber Lee plans to remove the dogs from the show and make it all about her. Heartbroken, Sharpay seeks the support of Peyton, and they make up. The next day (the first day of previews), Sharpay and Roger concoct a plan to remove Amber Lee from the show. Roger smears raw chicken all over her golden shoes, and when Amber Lee wears them, the dogs start to lick her shoes. Her plan works when Amber Lee reveals her true colors to the audience, who become outraged and begin booing her, with her outburst. However, Amber Lee quits the production, and Sharpay is fired.\n\nWhen the show is about to be canceled due to the loss of its star, Peyton shows his footage of Sharpay singing the show's emotional ballad (\"New York's Best Kept Secret\"). Impressed, the directors reinstate Sharpay as the lead. However, Sharpay only accepts the role on the condition that Boi and Countess split the role of the best friend equally. The directors agree, and the production is back on. Sharpay confides in Peyton her fears about being a star. Assuring her that she will be great, Peyton kisses her. On opening night, paparazzi are everywhere, and fans and stars alike flood the theatre to see the opening night of A Girl's Best Friend . Peyton, Sharpay's parents, and the world watch as Sharpay finally takes the stage in her Broadway debut (\"The Rest of My Life\").\n\n### Additional scene\n\nIn a scene exclusive to television and Netflix showings, Sharpay's twin brother, Ryan ( Lucas Grabeel ), on a break from his musical tour around the country, pays her a visit after she becomes a star on Broadway to congratulate her. When Boi escapes from Sharpay's apartment, she chases after him, and Ryan relaxes on his sister's bed until it folds back into the closet, taking him with it.",

The cast album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album , and two songs from the show (the title tune and \" I'll Never Fall in Love Again \") became hit singles for Dionne Warwick .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nChuck Baxter is an ambitious bachelor and junior executive for a large insurance company, Consolidated Life, who expresses his frustrations and hopes for career advancement (\"Half as Big as Life\"). To curry favor with higher-ups in the company, he allows his apartment to be used for their romantic trysts in return for promises of promotion (\"Upstairs\"). Chuck has his own eye set on Fran Kubelik, a waitress in the company cafeteria whom he's always admired from a distance. While talking together she wonders if she will ever find someone to share her life with. Chuck hopes that she might notice him (\"You'll Think of Someone\").\n\nJ.D. Sheldrake, the company's powerful personnel director, notices the glowing reviews written by Chuck's superiors and deduces the reason for them.  He requests sole use of the apartment for his affairs in exchange for Chuck's long-awaited promotion and tickets to a basketball game (\"Our Little Secret\"). (In the 2010 revival, the song \" I Say a Little Prayer For You \" was added for a scene in which Fran tells female workmates about flowers she has received from a new \"mystery individual\".) Chuck asks Fran to attend the basketball game with him, and she agrees to meet him there after first having a drink with her soon-to-be ex-lover (\"She Likes Basketball\").\n\nFran's lover turns out to be the married Sheldrake. Fran wants to end the relationship, but Sheldrake talks her into spending the evening with him (\"Knowing When to Leave\"). Though Fran stands him up, Chuck forgives her. When he informs the other executives that his apartment is no longer available for their use, they express dismay (\"Where Can You Take a Girl?\"). Meanwhile,  Sheldrake wonders why he is drawn to affairs (\"Wanting Things\"). The scene shifts to the company Christmas party, where everyone is enjoying themselves (\" Turkey Lurkey Time \"). Miss Olsen, Sheldrake's secretary, reveals to Fran that she is simply the latest in a long line of Sheldrake's mistresses. The first-act curtain falls as Fran is driven to misery (\" A House is Not a Home \" in the 2010 revival), and Chuck discovers that Fran is the one Sheldrake has been taking to his apartment.\n\n### Act II\n\nA despondent Chuck spends Christmas Eve trying to drink away his troubles at a bar, where he meets another tipsy lonelyheart, Marge MacDougall, who agrees to come back to his apartment (\"A Fact Can Be a Beautiful Thing\"). In the meantime, at Chuck's apartment, Fran confronts Mr. Sheldrake about his earlier affairs. While he admits to the affairs, he declares his love for Fran, but tells her that he must leave in order to catch his train home to spend Christmas Eve with his family. A despairing Fran discovers Chuck's sleeping pills and takes the whole bottle (\"Whoever You Are\").\n\nWhen Chuck arrives with Marge, he discovers Fran on his bed.  After quickly disposing of Marge, a frantic Chuck gets his neighbor, Dr. Dreyfuss, to come over and together they save her life.  The next morning Chuck calls Sheldrake to let him know what happened. Sheldrake says he can't leave for the city without his wife knowing and asks Chuck to take care of Fran (\"Christmas Day\").\n\nOver the next few days Chuck and Dreyfuss try to keep Fran's spirits up to prevent a relapse into suicidal behavior (\"A Young Pretty Girl Like You\"). Chuck and Fran play gin rummy and discuss their problems, growing closer (\" I'll Never Fall In Love Again \"). Mr. Kirkeby, one of Chuck's former 'clients', discovers that Fran has been staying at Chuck's apartment, so as revenge for cutting him and the others off from using the apartment he tells Fran's overly protective brother where she has been staying.  Karl Kubelik then comes to the apartment to collect her, and believing that Chuck is the cause of her current state he punches Chuck.\n\nMiss Olsen soon discovers that Sheldrake's actions led to Fran almost killing herself. She quits her job and tells Mrs. Sheldrake all about her husband's affairs. She leaves him, resulting in his desperation to woo Fran back. Sheldrake asks for the keys to Chuck's apartment again on New Year's Eve to take Fran there.  Chuck refuses and quits his job rather than allow Sheldrake to take Fran to his apartment ever again (\"Promises, Promises\").\n\nDeciding that he has to get away, Chuck begins packing to move elsewhere when Fran comes to see him. Sheldrake had told her that Chuck had refused him access and quit, and she realizes that Chuck is the one who really loves her.  As they resume their earlier game of gin, he declares his love for her, to which she replies, \"Shut up and deal\".",

Over Simba's protestations, Kiara wanders off alone into the barren Outlands \u2014 home to an enemy pride of Scar 's exiled followers called the Outsiders \u2014 and encounters another cub, Kovu. After narrowly escaping a crocodile-infested river, the cubs befriend each other. When Simba comes across Kovu and Kiara playing, he misinterprets it as fighting and confronts Kovu just as he is confronted by Zira, Kovu's mother and the Outsiders' leader. Simba later explains to Kiara the responsibilities of queenship and that everyone is a part of each other. Zira, who is secretly training Kovu as an assassin, realizes she can use her son's friendship with Kiara to kill Simba and usurp the throne. Meanwhile, the spirit of Simba's late father, Mufasa , plans to bring Kiara and Kovu together to reunite the Pridelanders and the Outsiders.\n\nYears later, an adolescent Kovu rescues Kiara after his older siblings Nuka and Vitani start a wildfire during her first solo hunt. Alerted to Kiara's location, Simba accepts Kovu's offer to join the Pridelanders, though he remains suspicious of his motives. Later, while training Kiara in hunting, Kovu begins reconsidering his mission to kill Simba and tells Kiara he is not Scar's actual son. Simba's friend and advisor, Rafiki, leads the lions to the jungle and helps them fall in love by introducing them to \"upendi\" (a form of upendo , which means \"love\" in Swahili ). At Nala's persuasion, Simba has Kovu spend the night inside Pride Rock with the rest of the Pridelanders. Vitani, however, secretly sends word back to Zira about Kovu's failure to kill Simba.\n\nThe next morning, Simba shows Kovu the Pride Lands and tells him the truth about Scar. The Outsiders ambush Simba and trick him into thinking Kovu has betrayed him. In the ensuing battle, Nuka is killed and Simba escapes. Kovu turns on Zira and pleads Simba for forgiveness, but is instead exiled. Kiara makes Simba realize his irrational behavior and leaves Pride Rock to personally search for Kovu. After reuniting, Kiara and Kovu return to the Pride Lands and successfully convince the Pridelanders and Outsiders to stop fighting. Zira, however, tries attacking Simba, but is instead flipped off a nearby cliff to her death.\n\nFollowing the battle, Simba welcomes the rest of the Outsiders, including Kovu, back into the Pride Lands, thus finally reuniting them with the Pridelanders.

The story, a contemporary version of the novels Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass (1871) by Lewis Carroll , is set in New York City and focuses on writer Alice Cornwinkle and her 10-year-old daughter Chloe.\n\nAfter various workshops and productions of the musical in Tampa, Florida and Houston, Texas , the show premiered on Broadway on April 17, 2011, closing a month later, on May 15, 2011.",
        "synopsis": "The story, in the Broadway production, was as follows:\n\nAuthor Alice Stetson and her daughter have just moved to Queens, New York so that Alice can have some space from her husband, Jack. Her young daughter, Chloe, laments about the move and her family's demise, as Alice notes that her life isn't going in the direction she had hoped. Edwina, Jack's mother, is cooking dinner for Chloe. Alice, who has just hit her head on the light of the building's service elevator, receives her children's book manuscript back from the publishers, who have coldly rejected it, saying it is too dark for children. She sadly makes a comment that Alice in Wonderland, the book Edwina had been reading to Chloe, was dark. As she lies down, she is awoken by a white rabbit who she follows down to Wonderland (\"Down the Rabbit Hole\").\n\nIn Wonderland, she encounters strange people and creatures who are dressed in the same dresses that the original Alice in Wonderland is known to wear (\"Welcome to Wonderland\"). She tries to discover why she has been brought there, and finds a mysterious drink (\"Drink Me\"). She then encounters the Caterpillar , whose advice is to follow in the footsteps of  El Gato (the Cheshire Cat ) to find out who she is (\"Advice from a Caterpillar\" and \"Go With the Flow\"). El Gato believes himself to be invisible, but he has lost the power; Alice learns from the Caterpillar that the characters in Wonderland \"don't have the heart to tell him\". El Gato leads her to the White Rabbit, when White Knight makes a grand entrance. He and his cohorts promises to save her at all means (\"One Knight\") and invites her to the Tea Party (\"The Mad Tea Party\").\n\nAt the party, the Mad Hatter announces with flair that she intends to rule things in Wonderland (\"The Mad Hatter\"). She reads Alice's tea leaves, commenting on Alice's bad qualities as the Queen arrives. The Queen announces that she is the ruler and all must obey her, or it will be off with your head (\"All Hail the Queen\"). Alice promises to take the Queen a brand new kingdom \u2013 the kingdom of Queens (a reference to her home in New York). The Hatter, angry, goes with Morris the March Hare to find her revenge on Alice who is a threat to the Hatter's plans. The Rabbit, El Gato, Caterpillar and Jack the White Knight all agree to help Alice find the service elevator that brought her there. Alice just wants to go home, as she and Chloe, in their new apartment, yearn for the way things used to be (\"Home Reprise\").\n\nThe Mad Hatter, who uses the name \"Maddie\", and the March Hare ascend the rabbit hole to Chloe's bedroom. They convince Chloe to come with them to help with Alice and Jack's marriage treatment to bring the family closer together (\"A Nice Little Walk\").  Chloe goes with them to Wonderland. However, the Hatter takes Chloe to the Land of the Looking-Glass as a prisoner, the Hatter's side of the kingdom, given to her by the Queen of Hearts, where she captures and turns her prisoners' \"brains to tapioca\". Jack agrees to help Alice in exchange for a kiss, as the White Rabbit makes mention of this news. Together, Alice, Jack, Rabbit, El Gato and the Caterpillar agree to break through the Looking-Glass to save Chloe (\"Through the Looking Glass\").\n\nInside the Hatter's war room, she locks Chloe in the tallest dungeon. She also captures the Caterpillar, El Gato and the White Knight as they fight to free Alice (and the Rabbit).  The Hatter declares she will win her battle (\"I Will Prevail\"). Alice finds herself in front of a door with the comedy and tragedy masks. She notices above the door the word \"THEATRICAL\" (which changes spell HATTER and ALICE, with the letter \"E\" rotating between the two names) though she misses the clue the first time, this is when the Rabbit tells Alice that he can turn back time by just \"winding back his watch\". Alice tells the Rabbit to get captured and use the watch to save everyone. After the Rabbit leaves, Alice enters and encounters Lewis Carroll (the Victorian Gentleman).  He encourages her to write something that is important to her, something she dreamt of (\"I Am My Own Invention\").\n\nThe Hatter delivers the list of executions to the Queen of Hearts, 7 beheadings, with the names of 6 of the characters and a \"wildcard\" slot (meant for the Queen). The Hatter eggs her on that she is the only one who can say \"Off with their heads\" with such flair, and convinces the Queen to allow the beheadings to take place in the land of the Looking-Glass. The Queen delights in the truth of her signature phrase (\"Off With Their Heads\").  Lewis Carroll leads Alice to a hall of mirrors, where she believes she has found Chloe. However, she realizes she is talking to a young Alice. She finally learns why she was brought to Wonderland: to remember and love who she is and was (\"Once More I Can See\").\n\nBack at the prison, the Rabbit is captured. When Morris the March Hare asks for any valuables he wants them to keep safe, he hands over the watch. When Jack asks why he was captured, he explains about the watch to save them, but the prisoners are dismayed at the news. Jack tells the Rabbit to find dismiss his fears, that they will get the watch back, but they must attack the very men they are trying to save. They defeat the prison guards, who are Jack's Boy-Band Knights that were transformed after the Hatter brought them under her control, and return them to their normal mindset when they get the watch back. They free the rest of the guards from the Hatter's command, leaving her defenseless. The boy-band, Jack, Caterpillar, Rabbit and El Gato save Alice from the dungeon and learn that together, anything is possible (\"Together\"). Morris hands over the beheading list to Jack, where they learn of the Hatter's plans to overthrow everyone, including the Queen. When the Hatter arrives to taunt Alice with a final riddle, Alice learns that the Hatter is the alter-ego of herself. Alice did not come to Wonderland when she was supposed, due to her mother's death and her childhood coming to an end, over two decades prior. Due to this, the Hatter was created out of every bad moment Alice has ever faced in her life. The Queen, learning of the Hatter's plan to behead her, banishes the Hatter to the underground world. Alice, who tries to defend the Hatter, is held at knife-point until Jack saves her. However, he is brought down to the underworld as well. Alice is happy that she may leave with Chloe, but the two lament Jack's death as they go home (\"Heroes\").\n\nAlice awakens from her dream when her husband, Jack, arrives with Chloe's forgotten doll and claiming it is his White Knight syndrome that drove him there and his desire to protect his family since they're under a new roof. Alice embraces him and realizes what she has in front of her eyes, the family is together once again. As they all head down for dinner, she remains behind for a moment to write down what she has learned from her adventures in Wonderland, but especially what she learned from the rabbit, that time is fleeting, and from her dream: \"ordinary magic happens every single day\", and it is all around us in the simplest ways (\"Finding Wonderland\").",

        "description": "Grind is a 1985 musical with music by Larry Grossman , lyrics by Ellen Fitzhugh , and a book by Fay Kanin . Grind is a portrait of a largely African-American burlesque house in Chicago in the Thirties.\n\nReviews of the production were mixed at best. In his The New York Times review, Frank Rich wrote: \"...the show has become a desperate barrage of arbitrary musical numbers, portentous staging devices, extravagant costumes..., confused plot twists and sociological bromides...\"\n\nGrind eventually closed after a run of slightly more than two months, losing its entire $4.75 million investment. It was one of a string of six Broadway flops directed by Hal Prince in the 1980s, and Prince and three other members of the creative team were suspended by the Dramatists Guild for signing a \"substandard contract.\"\n\nIn a Broadway season described by theater historian Ken Mandelbaum as \"dismal\" for new musicals, Grind was nominated for seven Tony Awards , including Best Musical; it eventually won two, for Best Featured Actress in a Musical ( Leilani Jones ) and Best Costume Design (Florence Klotz).",
        "synopsis": "The singers, dancers, comedians, and strippers who make up the ensemble of Harry Earle's Burlesque take the stage and welcome the audience (\u201cThis Must Be the Place\u201d). The year is 1933 and the city is Chicago. We are introduced to the white characters: HARRY EARLE, the owner of the venue; his wife, ROMAINE, who is a stripper; and the lead white comedians, SOLLY and GUS. We are also introduced to the black characters: LEROY, the lead black comedian; SATIN, who is also a stripper; and MAYBELLE, the wardrobe lady for the black performers.\n\nBackstage, the color lines are harshly drawn: The white performers congregate in one dressing room, while the black performers congregate in another. Black and white performers do not perform together onstage during the various acts, as dictated by the local authorities.\n\nLeroy, a known playboy who has had affairs with many of the black chorus girls, flirts with Satin and orders ribs for the women. Harry interviews LINETTE, who is applying to become one of the black chorus girls. In a private moment, Gus confesses to Solly that he's been losing his eyesight. Solly assures that Gus that as long as the routines go well, no one will notice.\n\nOnstage, Gus performs a hospital sketch with Romaine (who plays a sexy nurse) and an actor referred to as The Stooge (\u201cCadaver\u201d). The sketch goes awry when Gus accidentally sticks The Stooge with a prop needle, which causes the actor to quit the show. Gus tries to brush off the incident, but Harry is quick to point out that this is the third \u201cStooge\u201d to quit in two weeks. Satin goes onstage to perform a strip routine (\u201cA Sweet Thing Like Me\u201d).\n\nGus, unable to find a replacement sketch partner, enters the alley outside the venue so he can think (\u201cI Get Myself Out\u201d). In a moment of desperation, he enlists DOYLE, one of the many homeless men who reside in the alley. Doyle is drunk and doesn't speak, but Gus moves forward.\n\nInside the venue, Harry speaks with DIX, a neighborhood cop. Dix is assured that none of the performers are violating color lines and is invited to take a look around to ensure this fact. Gus introduces Doyle to Harry, who rejects the bum outright. Nevertheless, Gus tells Doyle to wait for him in his dressing room. Doyle, confused and unfamiliar with the venue, walks upstairs to the black dressing room.\n\nLeroy arrives with ribs and continues to flirt with Satin, who has been unsettled by the appearance of Dix. Leroy assures her and the black chorus girls that everything will be fine (\u201cMy Daddy Always Taught Me to Share\u201d). When he goes upstairs to the black dressing room, Leroy is surprised to find Doyle waiting. He leads the stranger downstairs to the white dressing room and offers him a bottle of whiskey, which Doyle eagerly accepts. Gus, Solly, and Romaine desperately try to sober Doyle up in time for his first performance.\n\nIn the alley, Satin meets with her kid brother, GROVER. Satin has been giving Grover money she's earned to help their mother, MRS. OVETHA FAYE. Mrs. Faye, who appears in the alley, makes it clear that she does not want her daughter's money, as it has been earned working at the burlesque venue. Mrs. Faye exits with Grover, leaving Satin to fume. Leroy tries to comfort her, though she assumes it is yet another pass. She reveals her true name (Laticia) and insists that the woman Leroy sees onstage every night is not the woman he'd be bringing home. When she eventually settles down, it will be with the kind of man \u201cthey don\u2019t make anymore\u201d (\u201cAll Things To One Man\u201d. Leroy, taken aback by her display of emotion, makes a joke before heading onstage. During his routine (\u201cThe Line\u201d), Leroy despairs over his inability to be serious when the moment counts.\n\nGus and Doyle, having managed to squeak through their first performance, exit into the alley. When Gus tries to worm his way out of paying Doyle, the latter lashes out. Gus begs Doyle to return the next day so that they may continue working together. Doyle, left alone, begins to sing to an unseen wife and son (\u201cKatie, My Love\u201d). He secretly longs to die so that he may be with them. Satin asks if he's okay, to which Doyle replies, \u201cI could tell you I\u2019m feelin\u2019 no pain, ma\u2019am - but I'd be lyin\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, the performers slowly enter as Gus waits for Doyle\u2019s arrival. The company sings (\u201cRise and Shine\u201d), with the performers complaining and Maybelle encouraging them to do their best. We see Satin discussing a bike with Leroy over the phone. Gus is delighted to find a newly shaven, cleanly dressed Doyle waiting in the dressing room. Leroy enters with a new bike that he and Satin plan to give to Grover on his 10th birthday. When it's revealed that Leroy doesn't know how to ride a bike, Doyle offers to ride it to Grover's home (\u201cYes Ma\u2019am\u201d). Leroy and Satin mock Mrs. Faye as they head to the south side of Chicago (\u201cWhy Mama Why\u201d).\n\nAt Mrs. Faye's home, Satin and Leroy arrive just as Doyle coasts in on Grover's new bike. They present an upside down cake prepared by Romaine but Mrs. Faye, incensed, denounces the party so that she may focus on her ironing. Doyle tells a story about his childhood that transfixes the group, including Mrs. Faye. The old woman ultimately joins in as Grover blows out his birthday candles.\n\nDoyle helps Grover learn how to ride his bike. A quartet of white PUNKS confront the group and destroy the bike, calling Doyle a \u201cn***er lover\u201d. Leroy is unable to process the situation and escapes into the first act's closing number (\u201cThis Crazy Place\u201d). Satin protests but ultimately gives into the performance, assuring Leroy that what they've just experienced was nothing more than a dream.\n\nThe next day, Linette expresses concern that she won't be ready for her next number. The performers reassure her that, no matter what they do onstage, it doesn't matter so long as they're undressed \u201cFrom The Ankles Down\u201d.\n\nSatin gives Romaine a note from Grover, thanking her for his birthday cake. Though she is reluctant to accept, Satin agrees to sit in the white dressing room with Romaine and talk about the birthday party. She is unable to reveal exactly what happened on that day. Leroy shows up with a receipt for a replacement bike but Satin rejects his offer, insisting that he can't \u201ckeep smilin\u2019 everything away\u201d. Romaine enters the black dressing room to talk to Leroy and encourage him to keep trying with Satin. When Harry sees his wife exiting the black dressing room, he reminds her that they could be shut down for such a violation.\n\nGus introduces a juggling routine to Doyle but is infuriated when his eyesight prevents him from juggling properly. Doyle suggests that they incorporate his mistakes into the act. As they create this revised routine, Satin watches from afar (\u201cWho Is He?\u201d). Gus notices that Doyle is taking notes and insists that a true performer should \u201cNever Put It In Writing\u201d. Doyle gets it (\u201cI Talk, You Talk\u201d) and the three performers come together for a big finish. Satin flinches when she realizes Doyle is holding her arm.\n\nWhen Gus and Doyle perform their juggling act onstage, it ends with Gus accidentally walking off the stage and becoming enveloped in the stage works. Harry declares that Gus is no longer fit to work at the venue. Doyle promises to help his new partner, seeing as Gus was the one to pull him out of the alley and give him a reason for living. Gus tries to appear cheerful but sings a mournful reprise of \u201cI Get Myself Out\u201d when left alone.\n\nRomaine and Solly perform a comedy routine (\u201cTiming\u201d) when a gunshot is heard backstage. Harry appears before the audience to report that an accident has occurred and the show has been cancelled. Doyle is shown standing next to a funeral wreath as Maybelle and the company mourn the death of Gus (\u201cThese Eyes of Mine\u201d).\n\nLeroy and Satin arrive backstage on a Sunday, having been unable to locate Doyle, who has gone missing since the funeral. Leroy takes a moment to clarify that he doesn't view Satin as a one-time girl. He wants to be with her permanently, if she'll have him. Satin is lost in thought and states that she'll need time to think about Leroy's offer. Despite this, Leroy believes he's on the right track and privately claims victory (\u201cNew Man\u201d). Satin realizes that the only spot she hasn't checked is the alley and is horrified to find a drunken Doyle being beaten by STREET TOUGHS. She barely manages to pry Doyle out of their grip by threatening to call the cops.\n\nDoyle is taken to Satin's apartment, where he drunkenly calls out for his dead wife and son. Sitting up in bed, he catatonically reveals how, when he was living in Ireland, he made a bomb intended to kill British soldiers on a train. It was only after the explosion that Doyle learned his wife and son were on that same train (\"Down\"). He collapses, and the next morning he reveals to Satin that his real name is Thomas. They kiss, and when Satin opens her door to leave for work she is met with the sight of two cartons of ribs. She and Doyle realize that Leroy must have been outside the entire time.\n\nOnstage, Leroy sings about Chicago and \u201cA Century of Progress\u201d. The chorus girls appear onstage with Satin and Leroy proceeds to humiliate her, ripping off her wig and g-string in front of the audience. Satin escapes to her dressing room and is confronted by Leroy, who slaps her. He gets into a fight with Doyle that highlights the color line and causes the company to fight amongst themselves. Henry intervenes and demands that everyone get back to work.\n\nSatin appears onstage to sing another rendition of \u201cA Sweet Thing Like Me\u201d. She is interrupted by the Street Toughs, who throw tomatoes at her until she is led offstage by the Stage Manager. Doyle confronts the Street Toughs and the Company spills onto the stage to help fend them off. The group freezes in a moment of stylized theatricality so that Leroy and Satin can be shown backstage. They make amends and Leroy vows to help her in any way that he can, even if they can't be together. The Street Toughs are defeated and the company triumphantly crosses the color barrier, vowing that they won't be segregated moving forward. Leroy, Satin, and Doyle are shown arm in arm once more (\u201cThis Must Be the Place - Reprise\u201d).",

        "title": "Thoroughly Modern Millie (musical)",
        "description": "Thoroughly Modern Millie is a musical with music by Jeanine Tesori , lyrics by Dick Scanlan , and a book by Richard Morris and Scanlan. It is based on the 1967 film of the same name , which itself was based on the British musical Chrysanthemum , which opened in London in 1956. Thoroughly Modern Millie tells the story of a small-town girl, Millie Dillmount, who comes to New York City to marry for money instead of love\u00a0\u2013 a thoroughly modern aim in 1922, when women were just entering the workforce. Millie soon begins to take delight in the flapper lifestyle, but problems arise when she checks into a hotel owned by the leader of a white slavery ring in China . The style of the musical is comic pastiche . Like the film on which it is based, it interpolates new tunes with some previously written songs.\n\nAfter previews at the La Jolla Playhouse in San Diego, California , in October 2000, the show opened on Broadway on April 18, 2002. The production subsequently won six 2002 Tony Awards , including Best Musical . Due to the success of the original Broadway production, there was both a United States tour and a West End production launched in 2003, followed by a United Kingdom tour in 2005. The musical has since become a popular choice for high school productions, but has garnered controversy over its racial stereotyping of its Asian characters , and has been described as \"a piece [that] walks the line of being entertaining and highly offensive\".",
        "synopsis": "Act I\n\nIn 1922, Millie Dillmount arrives in New York City from Salina, Kansas . Determined to be successful, she tears up her return ticket (\"Not for the Life of Me\"). She bobs her hair for a modern \" flapper \" look (\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\"). She is soon mugged, losing her hat, scarf, purse and a shoe. Seeking help and in a panic, she trips bypasser Jimmy Smith, a handsome, carefree young man who goes through life on whims and wits. He lectures Millie on why she should return home: she is just another girl with false hopes who does not belong in the big city. Almost taking his advice, she changes her mind and yells after him, \"Who needs a hat? Who needs a purse? And who needs YOU, mister whoever-you-are?!\" and soon takes a room at the Hotel Priscilla for Single Women (\"Not For the Life of Me [reprise]\").\n\nA week later, Millie is confronted by the mysterious and sinister Mrs. Meers, the hotel proprietress. A former actress, Meers now works for a white slavery ring in Hong Kong, kidnapping orphaned girls and shipping them to the Orient, which she has just done to Millie's hall mate, Ethel Peas. Mrs. Meers declares that Millie \"has two minutes to pack, or find her things on the street!\"  Millie then meets the wealthy Miss Dorothy, who wants to learn how the poorer half lives (\"How the Other Half Lives\"), and asks to rent a hotel room. Millie suggests Miss Dorothy can room with her until another room become available, but only if Miss Dorothy pays the rent.  Mrs. Meers says Millie can get a rent extension and Miss Dorothy can take room next to Millie's that just became available. When Millie asks what happened to Ethel, the former occupant, Mrs. Meers claims she got an acting job in the Orient.\n\nIn the hotel laundry room, two Chinese immigrants, Ching Ho and Bun Foo, are working for Mrs. Meers to earn enough money to bring their mother from Hong Kong over to the US (\"Not for the Life of Me [reprise]\").\n\nAfter researching some of the richest and most eligible bachelors in the world, Millie comes to Sincere Trust, looking for a job and also to set her sights on the company's boss, Trevor Graydon III (\"The Speed Test\"). Her lightning speed stenography easily lands her the job. Meanwhile, Ching Ho attempts to capture Miss Dorothy for Mrs. Meers with a drugged apple but when he sees her, he falls in love with her instantly and wants to save her from Mrs. Meers. Before Dorothy eats the drugged apple, Millie arrives (Mrs. Meers has to act like she was getting a stain out of the carpet with \"soy sauce\") with the good news that she has found a job and a boss to marry. As the girls rush off to their rooms, Mrs. Meers thinks about how stupid the girls are never to realize her evil plan to ship them to Southeast Asia (\"They Don't Know\"). To celebrate their success the girls go to a speakeasy , where they meet Jimmy, but the club is raided by the police. While waiting for his release in the jail cell, Jimmy realizes that he loves Millie (\"What Do I Need with Love\").\n\nJimmy asks Millie to a party hosted by famous singer Muzzy van Hossmere, and she accepts. Before the party, Muzzy sings of her love for New York (\"Only in New York\"). At the party, Millie spills wine on Dorothy Parker 's dress, which Millie tries to get out with soy sauce, following Mrs. Meers' example. After the party, Millie explains to Jimmy how she is going to marry Trevor. She also tells him off for being a \"skirt chaser\" and \"womanizer.\" As they argue, Jimmy suddenly grabs Millie and kisses her, then runs away. Millie realizes that she loves Jimmy (\"Jimmy\"). Millie returns to the hotel and overhears a conversation between Miss Dorothy and Jimmy, \"I really want to tell her, she's my best friend\" followed by \"You know we can't\". Millie sees Jimmy sneaking out of Miss Dorothy's room after what appears to be a late-night tryst; confused and horrified, Millie decides she never wants anything to do with Jimmy ever again.\n\nAct II\n\nAt Sincere Trust, Millie tells the other stenographers that she is \"completely over\" Jimmy, then realizes she is still in love; the girls try to convince her to let him go (\"Forget About the Boy\"). Millie places more conviction into marrying Graydon, but when Dorothy comes to visit Millie at work, Mr. Graydon is immediately smitten with her instead (\"Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life\"/\"Falling in Love with Someone\"). The two set up a date together. While Millie is brooding over her lost chances, Jimmy breaks in through the window and asks her to dinner. She initially tells him off but then agrees (\"I Turned the Corner\"/\"Falling in Love with Someone\" [Reprise]).\n\nBack at the Hotel Priscilla, Mrs. Meers along with Ching Ho and Bun Foo get ready to drug Miss Dorothy, when Ching Ho refuses because he loves her. Mrs. Meers stops his ranting by reminding them of why they work for her, to raise money to see their mother again. She convinces them to go along with the plan (\"Muqin\").\n\nJimmy finally declares his feelings for Millie while washing dishes to pay their tab at Cafe Society while Muzzy is performing her hit (\"Long As I'm Here with You\"). Millie is confused by her feelings for Jimmy and her desire not to be poor and initially rejects him. She runs to Muzzy, who tells her she's a fool for throwing away true love for the sake of money. She tells the story of how she met her late husband, a supposedly poor but goodhearted man who gave her a green glass necklace. Regardless of his income status, she loved him anyway, and she later realized that her green glass necklace was actually genuine emerald . Millie reconsiders her feelings and finally realizes that she would rather have a green-glass love with Jimmy (\"Gimme, Gimme\").\n\nJust as she returns to Jimmy to confess her feelings, they encounter Graydon, who was stood up by Miss Dorothy for their date, and is drunkenly singing, annoying Dexter and his wife, Daphne, who are also on a date. Graydon tells Millie and Jimmy that Mrs. Meers told him Miss Dorothy had checked out of the hotel. When Millie recalls that several other tenants had also suddenly \"checked out\", and that all of them were orphans, Millie, Jimmy, and Graydon realize what Mrs. Meers is doing. They persuade Muzzy to pose as a new orphan in town to trick Mrs. Meers, who takes the bait, is exposed as the mastermind of the slavery ring, and is then taken to the police station. Meanwhile, Ching Ho had already rescued Miss Dorothy and won her heart.\n\nJimmy proposes to Millie, and, poor as he is, she accepts, \"because if it's marriage I've got in mind, love has everything to do with it.\" Jimmy turns out to be Herbert J. van Hossmere III, Muzzy's stepson, and one of the most eligible bachelors in the world. And Miss Dorothy turns out to be his sister, an heiress named Dorothy Carnegie Mellon Vanderbilt van Hossmere, and (unlike the 1967 film) she ends up not with the dismayed Trevor Graydon, but with Ching Ho. Muzzy reveals that to help Jimmy and Dorothy avoid getting caught by fortune-hunters, she sent them out into the world so that they could find spouses who weren't in it for the money. Both Jimmy and Dorothy had disguised their family name to avoid being found out as society heirs. In a final pairing, Bun Foo joins Graydon's company as a new stenographer after telling Graydon that he can type fifty words a minute. At the very end of the musical (after the bows), Bun Foo and Ching Ho are once again reunited with their mother (\"Curtain Call/Bows\").",

        "description": "The Wizard of Oz was a 1902 musical extravaganza based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum .  Although Baum is the credited book writer , Glen MacDonough was hired on as ghostwriter after Baum had finished the script. Much of the original music was by Paul Tietjens , some of which has been lost, although it was still well-remembered and in discussion at MGM in 1939 when the classic film version of the story was made. The original show was particularly popular because of its two comedy stars: Fred Stone playing the Scarecrow , and David C. Montgomery as the Tin Woodman .\n\nThe show premiered at the Chicago Grand Opera House on June 16, 1902, and then went on tour throughout the upper Midwest before moving to the Majestic Theatre on Broadway on January 21, 1903, where it ran for 293 performances through October 3. A second company was established, and the show went on tour from September 1903 through March 1904 before returning to the Majestic with an updated \"Edition De Luxe\". This version played through May and then moved on to the New York Theater for three weeks before returning to Chicago for a five-week run to finish the season.\n\nThe two companies toured the country from August 1904 to April 1905, and again from September 1905 to May 1906.  By this time, demand had slowed, and the second company was disbanded on February 28, 1906. The main \"Company A\" had one final tour from August to November 1906 before the rights were sold to Hurtig and Seamon .  The new production resumed the tour through May 1907, and continued for the 1907\u201308 and 1908\u201309 seasons.  Finally, the show was released to stock theater companies in 1911.\n\nThe show's history is covered in more than 100 pages of the book Oz Before the Rainbow : L. Frank Baum's 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' on stage and screen to 1939 by Mark Evan Swartz.",
        "synopsis": "The main plot of the show, as recounted in newspapers of the time, is Pastoria's attempts to regain the throne from the Wizard of Oz . The original protagonists' search for the Wizard puts them on the wrong side of the law. Synopsis by David Maxine\n\n### Act One: The Storm\n\nThe show opens on a Kansas farm from which Dorothy and her pet calf Imogene are blown to the Land of Oz by a tornado. Dorothy's farmhouse lands on a Wicked Witch, and the Munchkins proclaim Dorothy their heroine for setting them free. Dorothy wants to go home to Kansas. The Good Witch of the North gives Dorothy a Ruby Ring and tells her to go to the Emerald City to ask the Wizard of Oz to send her back to Kansas. Dorothy also gets a love interest when Sir Dashemoff Daily, the poet laureate of Oz, falls in love with her.\n\tNow, it so happens that a Kansas streetcar conductor named Pastoria, along with Tryxie Tryfle, his waitress-girlfriend, has been blown to Oz in the same tornado. To make matters more complicated, it turns out that Pastoria is the former King of Oz, having been ousted by the Wizard. Pastoria determines to regain his throne. Another new character is an Ophelia-like lady lunatic named Cynthia Cynch. She has gone \"mad\" searching for her long-lost lover, Niccolo Chopper.\n\tDorothy and her pet calf proceed on their journey and meet the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman (who happens to be Cynthia Cynch's lover turned tin). Dorothy with her friends and Pastoria with his entourage all stumble into a deadly Poppy Field where they nearly perish from the poisonous breath of the flowers. Everyone is saved by the Witch of the North, who creates a summer snowstorm to break the spell of the poppies.\n\n### Act Two: The Emerald City\n\nDorothy and her friends arrive in the Emerald City where the Wizard grants brains to the Scarecrow and a heart to the Tin Woodman. To celebrate, the Wizard announces a \"Ball of All Nations\" in which everybody gets to sing a topical song of ethnic origin. Pastoria arrives in the Emerald City, breaks up with Tryxie Tryfle, and stages a coup in which the Wizard of Oz is arrested. Dorothy and her pals are declared enemies of the state and they run for their lives as Pastoria regains the throne of Oz.\n\n### Act Three: The Borderland\n\nIn hiding and in disguise, Dorothy and company flee the Emerald City. They encounter Cynthia Cynch who is delighted to have found her missing tin lover. But alas, Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and Tin Woodman are eventually captured by Pastoria's henchmen and sentenced to death. Just as they are about to be executed, Dorothy calls on the Witch of the North, who magically appears and sets everyone free.",

They became a radio program in 1932 and 1936 as The Ziegfeld Follies of the Air .\n\nInspired by the Folies Berg\u00e8re of Paris, the Ziegfeld Follies were conceived and mounted by Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. Many of the top comedians, singers and other entertainers in America appeared in the shows. They were also known for displaying beautiful chorus girls, commonly called Ziegfeld Girls , dressed in elaborate costumes.\n\nThe biopic The Great Ziegfeld won the Oscar for Best Picture in 1937.

The libretto is by Gordon Greenberg and Chad Hodge , with music and lyrics by Irving Berlin . The musical opened on Broadway in 2016 after premiering at the Goodspeed Opera House in 2014.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn August 1946, song-and-dance trio Jim Hardy, Ted Hanover, and Lila Dixon perform at a club in New York City (\" Steppin' Out With My Baby /I'll Capture Her Heart\"). Afterwards, Jim proposes to Lila. She accepts, and he tells her that he bought Mason Farm in Midville, Connecticut , intending for them to leave show business to raise a family (\"The Little Things in Life\"). Lila is reluctant to give up performing. When Ted and his manager Danny announce that the trio has booked a six-week tour, Jim rejects the offer, but Lila agrees to tour with Ted as a duo, promising to join Jim in Connecticut after the tour. Eager to settle down, Jim moves to Midville (\" Blue Skies\" ).\n\nJim finds the old farmhouse falling apart, and local boy Charlie Winslow, on behalf of the local bank, presents Jim with a bill for back taxes. Jim is visited by the spirited Linda Mason, an aspiring performer-turned-schoolteacher who had lived on the farm. Linda and Jim are attracted to each other and awkwardly express their shared loneliness and longing to move forward with their lives (\"Marching Along With Time\"). Linda introduces Jim to Louise Badger, an overly enthusiastic farmhand who has worked at Mason Farm since Linda was a child. Jim and Louise tend to the farm with little success. Jim misses Lila; meanwhile, Ted and Lila have a successful tour (\" Heat Wave \"). Lila finally visits Jim (\" It's A Lovely Day Today \"), but she breaks off their engagement; she will continue performing with Ted.\n\nBy Thanksgiving , Ted and Lila are in Las Vegas (\"Plenty to Be Thankful For\"); although Louise tries to push Linda and Jim closer together, the two fail to connect, and Linda laments her loneliness (\"Nothing More to Say\"). On Christmas Eve , Jim and Louise decorate the farmhouse; he notes the irony of decorating a house for only themselves, but Louise has invited Jim's old performing friends to visit, so they all throw a party (\"Shakin' The Blues Away\"). Linda arrives and is impressed by the festivities. Jim realizes how much he misses performing. He and Louise decide to turn the farm into an inn \u2013 only open on holidays \u2013 as a way to satisfy his desire to perform while still living a quiet life most of the year, and to bring in money. Jim will write songs for each holiday, to be performed by him, Linda, and his friends. He plays Linda a Christmas song he wrote as an example of the type of song he might perform at the Inn (\" White Christmas \"), and he decides to stage the first performance on New Year's Eve .\n\nA week later, \"Holiday Inn\" is having its inaugural performance, and it proves popular (\" Happy Holiday \"). To ring in both the new year and Jim's new business, Linda performs publicly for the first time in many years (\"Let's Start the New Year Right\"). Ted drunkenly wanders into the inn, interrupts the song and begins dancing with her. Jim jealously punches Ted in the face, and Linda storms out.\n\n### Act II\n\nTed wakes up in Louise's bed, hung over; Lila has left their act to marry a millionaire in Texas; he cannot remember who he danced with before passing out, but he decides she must be his new dance partner. Jim, worried that Ted will steal Linda from him, pretends not to have seen Ted's new partner. Ted sets out to dance with every woman he sees, trying to track down the right one (\"You're Easy to Dance With\"). Linda is humiliated by Jim and Ted's behavior; Jim apologizes and offers to start over (\" Let's Take an Old-Fashioned Walk\" ). She agrees to give him another chance, and in time they begin a relationship.\n\nBy the Valentine's Day show, Jim loves Linda, and he writes a song about her for the Inn (\"Be Careful, It's My Heart\"). While he sings it to her, Ted walks in and realizes Linda is the girl he seeks. Jim objects that he does not want Ted to steal Linda from him, but Ted and Linda reassure him and perform together for the first time, headlining the performance. Jim jealously tries to prevent Ted and Linda from getting too close to each other, by cuing the band to change style and tempo several times (\" Cheek to Cheek \"). Jim apologizes for sabotaging the number, but he does so again in the Easter show by entering at the end of the song and singing with Linda and Ted (\" Easter Parade \"). Ted asks Danny to put an end to Jim's meddling. Danny reveals to Ted that two Hollywood producers are interested in putting Ted and Lila in a movie, and they will attend the next Holiday Inn performance. Louise hears this and calls Lila, asking her to come to the Inn.\n\nAs Linda prepares for the Independence Day performance (\"Song of Freedom\"), Louise locks her in the barn to prevent the producers from seeing her. With Linda missing, Ted improvises a solo tap number with fireworks (\"Let's Say It With Firecrackers\"). Lila arrives but mistakenly enters the barn where Linda is trapped, and reveals that the man she left Ted for owed millions rather than owning them; not knowing that Linda is Ted's new dance partner, she mentions the producers. Linda assumes Jim has sabotaged her again and leaves Lila locked in the barn, returning to the stage to join Ted for the end of his number. After the performance, Linda confronts Jim, but he has no knowledge of the producers nor of Lila's presence, and Louise admits she orchestrated the sabotage. As Linda forgives Jim, Danny reveals that the producers want to make a movie about Holiday Inn, starring Ted and Linda with Jim as a songwriter and consultant, but Jim wants to stay at the Inn. Linda is hurt by Jim's stoicism and leaves with Ted to make the movie (\"Nothing More to Say\" (reprise)).\n\nJim and Louise spend another Thanksgiving alone; with no headliners, they cancel the Holiday Inn shows. Louise motivates the despondent Jim and sends him to win back Linda in Hollywood. On the set of the movie, Linda is having a tough time with the fictionalization of the story, interrupting shots and proving difficult for the director and producers to work with. As she sings \"White Christmas,\" Jim enters the studio and sings with her, halting the production. Jim proposes to Linda and she accepts, quitting the film to be with him. Danny objects, but Ted lets her go. It is early in production, and Linda is replaced by Lila. An excerpt of the finished film is shown. (As an alternative scene, instead of the film excerpt, Lila talks with a reporter at the red-carpet movie premiere.) Later in Midville, Ted and Lila reunite at the wedding of Linda and Jim, who vow to continue performing at the Inn (\"Finale\").",

        "title": "Jesus Christ Superstar",
        "description": "Jesus Christ Superstar is a sung-through rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice . Loosely based on the Gospel accounts of the Passion , the work interprets the psychology of Jesus and other characters, with much of the plot centred on Judas , who is dissatisfied with how Jesus steers his disciples. Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities, and slang pervade the rock opera's lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events; stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional anachronisms .\n\nInitially unable to get backing for a stage production, the composers released the score as a 1970 concept album , an immediate success which led to its Broadway stage debut in 1971. By 1980, the musical had grossed more than $237 million worldwide. Running over eight years in London between 1972 and 1980, the show held the record for longest-running West End musical until 1989 (overtaken by Cats ).",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nJudas Iscariot , one of the Twelve Apostles , worries that the followers of Jesus are getting out of control and may be seen as a threat by the Roman Empire , who might harshly suppress them (\"Heaven on Their Minds\").\n\nThe other apostles anticipate entering Jerusalem alongside Jesus and ask him about his plans, but Jesus tells them not to worry about the future. Meanwhile, Mary Magdalene tries to help Jesus relax. Judas warns Jesus to avoid Mary because a relationship with a prostitute could be seen as inconsistent with his teachings and be used against him. Jesus scolds Judas, saying he should not judge others unless he is free of sin. Jesus then reproaches the apostles and complains that none of them truly care for him (\"What's the Buzz/Strange Thing Mystifying\").\n\nMary reassures Jesus while anointing him. Judas fumes that the money spent on fine oil should have been used to help the poor. Jesus reasons they do not have the resources to end poverty, and that they should treasure what comforts they possess (\" Everything's Alright \").\n\nMeanwhile, Caiaphas , the High Priest of Israel , assembles the Pharisees and priests. Like Judas, they fear that Jesus's followers will be seen as a threat by the Romans, and that many innocent Jews might suffer the consequences. Thus, Caiaphas concludes that for the greater good, Jesus must be executed (\" This Jesus Must Die \"). As Jesus and his followers arrive exultantly in Jerusalem, they are confronted by Caiaphas, who demands that Jesus disperse the crowd. Jesus instead greets them (\"Hosanna\"). Simon the Zealot suggests that Jesus lead his mob in a war against Rome and gain absolute power (\"Simon Zealotes\"). Jesus rejects this, stating that none of his followers understand what true power is (\"Poor Jerusalem\").\n\nPontius Pilate , the governor of Judea, has a dream in which he meets a Galilean and then receives the blame for the man's violent death at the hands of a mob (\"Pilate's Dream\"). Jesus arrives at the Temple and finds that it is being used as a marketplace; angered by this, he drives everyone out . A group of lepers ask Jesus to heal them. Their number increases, and overwhelmed, Jesus rejects them (\"The Temple\"). Mary Magdalene sings Jesus to sleep (\"Everything's Alright (Reprise)\"). While he sleeps, Mary acknowledges that she is in love with him, and it frightens her (\" I Don't Know How to Love Him \").\n\nConflicted, Judas seeks out the Pharisees and proposes helping them arrest Jesus, believing that Jesus is out of control and that Jesus himself would approve of this action. In exchange for his help, Judas is offered thirty pieces of silver . Judas adamantly refuses, but then accepts upon Caiaphas's suggestion that he could use the money to help the poor (\"Damned for All Time/Blood Money\").\n\n### Act II\n\nJesus shares a Passover meal with his disciples , where they get drunk and pay little attention to him. He remarks that \"for all you care\" the wine they are drinking could be his blood and the bread his body. He asks them to remember him, and then, frustrated by their lack of understanding, he predicts that Peter will deny him three times that night, and that another one of them will betray him. Judas admits that he is the one who will betray Jesus and, saying that he does not understand why Jesus had no plan, leaves (\"The Last Supper\").\n\nThe remaining apostles fall asleep as Jesus retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. He tells God his doubts about whether his mission has had any success and pleads to find a way to avoid the horrible death that awaits him. Receiving no answer, he realises that there is no other way to complete his mission, and resigns himself to God's will. (\"Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)\"). Judas arrives with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by kissing him on the cheek . When Jesus is brought to trial before the Sanhedrin, Caiaphas and the priests send him to Pilate (\"The Arrest\"). Meanwhile, Peter is confronted by three witnesses of Jesus's arrest, to each of whom he denies that he knows Jesus. Mary observes that Jesus had predicted this (\"Peter's Denial\").\n\nPilate asks Jesus if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus answers: \"That's what you say.\" Since Jesus is from Galilee, Pilate says that he is not under his jurisdiction and sends him to King Herod (\"Pilate and Christ\"). The flamboyant King Herod pressures Jesus to prove his divinity by performing miracles, but Jesus ignores him. Herod angrily sends him back to Pilate (\"King Herod's Song\"). Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostles remember when they first began following Jesus, and wish that they could return to a time of hope and peace (\"Could We Start Again, Please?\").\n\nJudas is horrified at Jesus's harsh treatment. He expresses regret to the Pharisees, correctly dreading that he will forever be remembered as a traitor. Caiaphas and Annas assure him that he has done the right thing. Judas throws the money he was given to the floor and storms out. He curses God for manipulating him, and commits suicide (\"Judas' Death\").\n\nAt Jesus's trial, Pilate attempts to interrogate Jesus, but is cut off by a bloodthirsty mob which demands that Jesus be crucified . Unnerved, he tells the mob that Jesus has committed no crime and does not deserve to die, but to satisfy the mob, he will have Jesus flogged . Pilate pleads with Jesus to defend himself, but Jesus says weakly that everything has been determined by God. The crowd still calls for Jesus's death, and finally, Pilate reluctantly agrees to crucify Jesus (\"Trial Before Pilate (Including The 39 Lashes)\").\n\nAs Jesus awaits crucifixion, the spirit of Judas returns and questions why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if it was all part of a divine plan after all (\" Superstar \"). Jesus is crucified, recites his final words, and dies (\"The Crucifixion\"). Jesus' body is taken down from the cross and buried (\"John 19:41\").",

It is the second installment in Richmond's \"Uranium Teen Scream Trilogy\", a collection of three theatrical works, one not yet written, that take place in the exaggerated Uranium City.",
        "synopsis": "The musical begins with a mysterious and headless girl in a school uniform singing the song of an unending dream-like state (\"Dream of Life\").\n\nThe Amazing Karnak, a mechanical fortune teller automaton, introduces himself as the show's narrator. Karnak tells the audience that he is able to predict the exact moment of a person's death and formerly could inform the subject of the details of their demise, but the carnival in which he operated set him to \"Family Fun Novelty Mode\", meaning that he could only repeat vague predictions and fairground advertising. Karnak reveals that he will die soon, as a rat he has named Virgil has been gradually chewing through the rubber of his power cable and will soon bite down on 200 volts of electricity, instantly killing them both. \"As there is nothing more base than death,\" Virgil is enlisted to play the bass .\n\nKarnak, in his guilt for being unable to warn five teenagers from Uranium City, Saskatchewan of their impending deaths, summons their spirits to take part in the show, which he has constructed as a \"final apology.\" Karnak introduces the audience to the Saint Cassian Chamber Choir (\"Uranium\") and recounts their deaths on The Cyclone, a malfunctioning rollercoaster. During the crash, the teens lament their lives in Uranium City, a once- boomtown that declined drastically with the closure of its uranium mines (\"Minor Turn\"). The five teenagers arrive in Karnak's limbo and are introduced, each given a forced catchphrase to quickly convey their personalities to the audience. Karnak reveals the teens are being placed into a game of life and death, where they must compete for a chance to return to life. Karnak reads a prophecy: \"The one who wants to win it the most shall redeem the loser in order to complete the whole.\"\n\nA sixth victim, the \"mystery contestant,\" dubbed Jane Doe by the coroner, is introduced. She was the headless character who opened the show. Since no family came to claim her body when it was found headless, and Karnak never read her fortune, her identity is unknown by both herself and everyone else (\"Jane Doe's Entrance\"). Through the original costume and prop design, it is suggested that Jane has replaced her head with that of a doll, whose body she carries around with her. Jane's entrance frightens the other choir members, but Karnak proceeds undisturbed and begins the competition.\n\nTo introduce each member of the choir, Karnak narrates a  \"Bumper.\" Underscored by variations on \"Karnak's Theme,\"  each segment portrays a brief retelling of the choir member's life, as the other students portray various key figures within it. At the end of each Bumper, the choir member delivers an extended monologue as a lead-in to their song.\n\nThe first contestant is Ocean O\u2019Connell Rosenberg, a perfectionist over-achiever (\"Ocean's Bumper\"). As a child of \"far-left of center humanists,\" Ocean always felt like the self-proclaimed \"white sheep\" of the family. She tells Karnak that she \"has seen enough reality TV \" to know what he wants her to do. She proceeds to sing a song themed around her own self-importance and ego, comparing herself to the other teens and pointing out how they all fall short compared to her. She believes she is the only one worth bringing back to life, as she has the highest chance of succeeding in the world (\"What the World Needs\"). After her song ends, Karnak reveals that the choice of who lives will be made by group consensus. Though Ocean clumsily attempts to take back her words (\"I Love You Guys\"), the rest of the choir, including her best friend, Constance Blackwood, has been incredibly offended by her social Darwinist rant.\n\nThe next contestant is Noel Gruber, the only gay boy in his small town who dreams of being a cold-hearted French prostitute , but was instead stuck working at a Taco Bell (\"Noel's Bumper\"). He sings about his desire to live the tragic, loveless life of his alter ego, \"Monique Gibeau\" (inspired by Marlene Dietrich in The Blue Angel ), who dies of typhoid flu at the end of the song (\"That Fucked Up Girl (Noel's Lament)\"). Ocean expresses annoyance that his song did not have a moral. Despite Karnak's objection, she insists that every story has a lesson (\"Every Story's Got a Lesson\") and gets Constance to perform an anti-drug improv PSA with her, though it soon becomes clear that Constance's dark sense of humor is antithetical to how Ocean wants her to be.\n\nThe third contestant is Mischa Bachinski, a Ukrainian adoptee who immigrated after his mother, dying from radiation poisoning while on a Chernobyl disaster clean-up crew, put him up for adoption and lied about his age. When he reached Canada , his adoptive parents were expecting a \"recently potty-trained\" two-year-old, but instead received a violent teenage boy with a drinking problem. To cope with the isolating treatment he received from his adoptive parents, he turned to \"self-aggrandizing commercialized hip-hop,\" posting his own original raps to YouTube (\"Mischa's Bumper\"). His song begins as a gangsta rap track that heavily relies on autotune (\"This Song Is Awesome\") before transitioning into a passionate Ukrainian love ballad to his online fianc\u00e9e whom he met through his YouTube comment section (\"Talia\"). Noel, whose own performance was previously supported by Mischa, comforts him.\n\nThe fourth contestant is Ricky Potts, a socially-awkward mute boy with a complex fantasy life. The original script indicates that Ricky has a movement disability caused by degenerative illness, but speaks and (depending on the interpretation) moves without impairment in the afterlife. A 2023 revision of the licensed script altered Ricky\u2019s backstory, replacing his physical disability with muteness. Ricky is mute as the result of trauma, having witnessed his now- Pentecostal preacher father being killed by their pet viper , JoJo. To combat his loneliness, Ricky retreats into detailed science fiction fantasies based on a childhood spent with his 14 cats, imagining himself as the intergalactic savior of a race of sentient, anthropomorphic \"sexy cat women\" from a distant planet (\"Space Age Bachelor Man\"). At least until the Off-Broadway production, he conceded his chance of being resurrected, but this was removed in later versions.\n\nRather than singing about her hopes, dreams, and fantasies, Jane Doe sings about her own despair (\"Jane Doe's Bumper\" and \"The Ballad of Jane Doe\"). Jane's headless body was found in the wreckage, and though she was presumed to be a member of the choir because of her uniform, her body went unclaimed and her identity remained unknown following the stress-induced death of their choir director later that day. Her spirit has no memory of who she was. After hearing Jane's tale, the choir rallies together and holds a birthday party for her featuring a rewritten birthday song, sharing a tender moment with each other (\"The New Birthday Song\").\n\nWhile Ricky bonds with Jane by giving her one of the names he had been \"saving up\" in life, and Noel and Mischa connect over seeing each other as they want to be seen, Ocean and Constance finally come to a head. Ocean, still desperate to return to life, hurts Constance deeply in her own self-obsession. Constance, fed up with being Ocean's sidekick, finally stands up for herself by punching Ocean in the boob.\n\nFinally taking her turn (\"Constance's Bumper\"), Constance reveals that, just three hours prior to the accident, she had lost her virginity to a 32-year-old carnie in a port-o-potty . She says she did it to \"just get it out of the way;\" however, she backtracks and reveals that it was more of an action of self-loathing. Frustrated with her image as the \"nicest girl in town,\" Constance talks about her family's pride for having worked in Uranium City \"since they opened the mines\" and that though she agreed with them at first, high school made her think it was lame to feel that way. Feeling guilt for how she resented her parents in life, she recalls the moment the coaster derailed, and how all her anger and misconceptions had dropped away as they flew through the air. Constance shares how she finally learned to appreciate every small moment in her life and love her small town. She laments that \"it took a horrible accident for [her] to realize how goddamn wonderful everything is.\" (\"Jawbreaker / Sugar Cloud\u201d). At the end of her song, Ocean apologizes to Constance, \"as if seeing her friend for the first time.\"\n\nAt last, it is time for the final vote. Karnak suddenly changes the rules, telling Ocean that she alone will get the deciding vote because she has the highest Grade Point Average . Having a crisis of conscience, she refuses to vote for herself. Recalling Karnak's prophecy, she realizes that Jane is the only one who doesn't have memories to take to the afterlife with her. Ocean says that while the teenagers died young, they at least had a life, admitting that she would \"gladly take [her] seventeen years over nothing.\" The choir support Ocean in her decision and send Jane to \"The Other Side.\" Karnak reveals her name to be Penny Lamb (a character in Richmond's play Legoland ). Whether she returns to life as Penny or starts a new life is left ambiguous. A compilation of home movies of her new life from youth to old age is played (\"It's Not a Game\"). Virgil finally tears through the rubber, killing himself and Karnak before the latter can give his final piece of insight. As Karnak dies, he says the same fairground advertising he told the teens before they rode The Cyclone: \"Your lucky number is seven. You will soar to great heights. Be sure to ride The Cyclone.\"\n\nSomewhere outside of limbo, the remaining teens unite and sing an uplifting song (\"It's Just a Ride\"). The voice of Jane Doe echoes her opening song: \"I know this dream of life is never-ending / It goes around and 'round and 'round again...\" as the teens travel towards whatever comes next.",

        "title": "Of Thee I Sing",
        "description": "Of Thee I Sing is a musical with a score by George Gershwin , lyrics by Ira Gershwin and a book by George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind .  The musical lampoons American politics; the story concerns John P. Wintergreen, who runs for President of the United States on the \"love\" platform. When he falls in love with the sensible Mary Turner instead of Diana Devereaux, the beautiful pageant winner selected for him, he gets into political hot water.\n\nThe original Broadway production, directed by Kaufman, opened in 1931 and ran for 441 performances, gaining critical and box office success.  It has been revived twice on Broadway and in concert stagings in the U.S. and in London.  In 1932, Of Thee I Sing was the first musical to win the Pulitzer Prize for Drama .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn the U.S. in the 1930s, a campaign parade is taking place to support \"Wintergreen for President\".  John P. Wintergreen has been nominated for President and Alexander Throttlebottom has been nominated for Vice President, but he is of such little importance no one can remember who he is.  Politicians meet in a hotel room to devise a campaign platform, and when they ask the chambermaid what she cares about, she first says \"money,\" then \"love\" when pressed further.  The men decide that Wintergreen's platform will be \"love\"; they'll have a pageant to select the most beautiful girl in the United States, and Wintergreen will fall in love and marry her.\n\nThe pageant begins in Atlantic City, New Jersey , and the contestants wonder, \"Who Is the Lucky Girl to Be?\"  The photographers assure them that even if they do not win, they will surely be loved (\"The Dimple on My Knee\").  Wintergreen is getting nervous about marrying a girl he doesn't know.  While the girls are at the final judging, he confides in Mary Turner, the sensible young woman running the pageant.  He does not want to marry a girl just because she's beautiful; he wants a wife who will make a good home for him and his future children.  Mary shares her corn muffin with him.  Wintergreen tells Mary that he'd rather marry her than any of the girls in the contest.  He kisses her, and she agrees to marry him.  The judges of the pageant announce that Diana Devereaux, a beautiful southern girl, has won the contest, but Wintergreen declares that he loves Mary Turner.  When he gives some of Mary's extraordinary corn muffins to the judges, they agree that John and Mary are meant to wed (\"Because, Because\").\n\nOutside Madison Square Garden in New York City, at a rally for Wintergreen, the campaigners declare that \" Love Is Sweeping the Country \".  Inside, where politicians are speaking in favor of Wintergreen, a wrestling match is going on just below the speakers' platform as Alexander Throttlebottom tries to explain to the organizers that he's the candidate for Vice-President. Wintergreen proposes to Mary onstage, as he has in forty-seven states before.  She accepts again, and Wintergreen sings the campaign song to her, \"Of Thee I Sing\".\n\nOn election night, Wintergreen wins by a landslide.  Inauguration Day arrives, which is also Wintergreen's wedding day. As his inaugural address, Wintergreen bids goodbye to the girls he used to know (\"Here's a Kiss for Cinderella\").  The Chief Justice presides over the wedding ceremony, and just after he has pronounced John and Mary man and wife, Diana Devereaux interrupts the proceedings. She is serving Wintergreen with a summons for breach of promise .  She insists she is the one he should have married (\"I Was the Most Beautiful Blossom\").  The Supreme Court rules that Mary's corn muffins are more important than justice in this matter, and Diana angrily leaves to tell her story across the nation.  Wintergreen leads the Supreme Court and spectators in a chorus of \"Of Thee I Sing\".\n\n### Act II\n\nJohn and Mary settle down to business in the White House .  Her \"desk,\" back-to-back with his, is a fully loaded tea-table. Their secretaries greet each other \"Hello, Good Morning\".  Alexander Throttlebottom, now Vice-President, sneaks into the White House with a tour group.  When a guide tells him that the Vice-President's job is to preside over the U. S. Senate , Throttlebottom eagerly dashes off to the Capitol .  Wintergreen's fellow party members inform him that Diana Devereaux is gaining support across the nation.  Wintergreen holds a press conference and tells the reporters that his love for Mary is the only thing that matters (\"Who Cares?\").  The French ambassador unexpectedly arrives (\"Gar\u00e7on, S'il Vous Pla\u00eet\").  He has a surprise for Mr. Wintergreen: Diana is \"'The Illegitimate Daughter' of an illegitimate son of an illegitimate nephew of Napoleon.\"  He insists that Wintergreen annul his marriage and marry Diana to right his grievous offense against France.  Everyone agrees that Wintergreen should be impeached for breach of promise (\"We'll Impeach Him\"), but John and Mary do not care, since they have each other (\"Who Cares?\" (Reprise)).\n\nThrottlebottom has found the Senate, and the party members inform him that he will soon be President.  He is very excited and goes into the Senate Chamber to preside, beginning by taking \"The Roll Call.\"  The resolution on the impeachment of the President is brought up, and the French Ambassador and Diana mournfully insist that she was \"Jilted.\"  Mary saves the day when she announces that she is pregnant (\"Who Could Ask for Anything More?\").  The senators refuse to impeach an expectant father, and Wintergreen declares that \"Posterity\" is just around the corner.  The French Ambassador informs Wintergreen that by not marrying Diana, he has contributed to France's declining birth rate.  He demands the Wintergreens' baby as a replacement for the one they have \"taken\" from France.  John refuses, and the ambassador walks out.\n\nIn the Yellow Room of the White House, guests are arriving bearing gifts for the baby (\"Trumpeter, Blow Your Horn\").  Wintergreen is nervously awaiting the baby's birth when the French Ambassador arrives with a final message from France: surrender the baby or France will sever diplomatic relations with the U.S.  The Supreme Court justices, who have the duty to determine the sex of the baby, announce that twins have been born, a boy and a girl.  The French ambassador is even more wounded by this proclamation: France has lost two babies instead of one!  Diana mournfully joins him, and Alexander Throttlebottom arrives bearing sweaters for the babies.  The French Ambassador is about to declare war when Wintergreen has a brilliant idea: according to Article Twelve of the Constitution, when the President of the United States is unable to fulfill his duties, his obligations are assumed by the Vice-President!  The ambassador calls Wintergreen a genius, and Throttlebottom is ecstatic as they pass Diana over to him.  Servants wheel a large bed into the room, where Mary sits with the babies.  Wintergreen leads everyone in proclaiming, \"Of Thee I Sing.\"",

        "title": "Rudolf (musical)",
        "description": "Rudolf is a musical conceived for the stage by Frank Wildhorn and Steve Cuden , with a book by Jack Murphy and Phoebe Hwang, lyrics by Murphy, additional lyrics by Nan Knighton , and music by Frank Wildhorn . Arrangements by Koen Schoots and orchestrations by Kim Scharnberg. It is about Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria and his extramarital relationship with Baroness Mary Vetsera . Their 1889 deaths at his Mayerling hunting lodge apparently were the result of a murder - suicide pact, although historians have debated this explanation.\n\nLoosely based on the book A Nervous Splendor: Vienna 1888-1889 by Frederic Morton , the musical was developed under the working titles Vienna , Aff\u00e4re Mayerling ( The Mayerling Affair ), and Rudolf - The Last Kiss . The pressures of the monarchy have fallen upon Rudolf's shoulders, he is in political and personal conflict with his father, Emperor Franz Joseph , and his marriage to Princess St\u00e9phanie of Belgium is crumbling when he meets and falls in love with the 17-year-old baroness. Their secret liaison doesn't escape the attention of prime minister Eduard Taaffe , who hopes to use his knowledge of the affair to destroy Rudolf's political career.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nCrown Prince Rudolf of Austria is forced, by his domineering wife Princess St\u00e9phanie of Belgium , to attend a ceremony commemorating forty years of reign by his father, Emperor Franz-Joseph. All the upper class of Austria attend the celebration, in the renovated Hofburg Theatre , and revel in their eccentricity; while the poor lower class citizens riot outside demanding reform. A miserable Rudolf spends the evening drinking and fighting a terrible cold. (\u201cVorhang auf / Curtain Up\u201d).\n\nFranz-Joseph gives his guests a speech promising a bright future for Austria, before pulling a switch that lights the theatre with electricity for the first time. The guests are then treated to a show starring three female singers in white gowns (\u201cWiener Schm\u00e4h / Viennese Specialties\u201d). Suddenly, a lower-class woman runs up onto the stage and shoots herself in the head , splattering blood all over the performers' dresses. Most of the guests run out in fear, but Rudolf stays and kneels before the body asking, \u201cWhy?\u201d Baroness Mary Vetsera steps forward and explains, \u201cIt is better to die all at once than to die a little every day.\u201d Rudolf is left contemplating the suffering of his subjects (\"Wie jeder andere Mann Prolog / An Ordinary Man\").\n\nFranz-Joseph has a meeting with his Minister-President, Count Eduard Taaffe about the \u201cembarrassing\u201d incident and rebellious newspaper articles published by a mysterious revolutionary named, \u201cJulius Felix.\u201d Rudolf interrupts begging his father to listen to his people, but the latter has no intent of doing so. Taaffe vents his suspicions that Julius Felix is an alias for Rudolf's cousin, Archduke Johan Salvator . Franz-Joseph is hesitant to believe Taaffe, but commands him to uncover the truth. Once Taaffe leaves, Rudolf tries to explain to his father that he can no longer ignore the cries of the lower class, but Franz-Joseph again denies Rudolf's pleas. The two men argue over how neither one understands the other (\u201cDu willst nicht h\u00f6ren / You Never Listen\u201d).\n\nThe next afternoon, Mary takes a walk with her best friend, Countess Marie Larisch , while reading Julius Felix's latest article (\u201cWiener Schm\u00e4h (reprise) / Viennese Specialties (reprise)\u201d). Mary, a fellow liberal, is enthralled by Felix's words, but Marie thinks he is dangerous. Marie advises Mary to turn her attention instead to saving her poor family from ruin by marrying the wealthy Duke of Bragan\u00e7a , but Mary is not interested. Marie reminds her friend that they have to prepare for a ball Franz-Joseph is hosting that night and goes into detail on how a woman can dress to attract a man (\u201cEin H\u00fcbscher Krieg / Pretty Little War.\u201d) Mary muses on her desire to find someone who shares her ideals (\u201cMary's Lied / Mary's Song\u201d).\n\nThe ball is in honor of the newly crowned German Emperor, Wilhelm II , another of Rudolf's cousins. Still suffering from his cold, Rudolf does not desire to attend, but is again forced to by St\u00e9phanie (\u201cDer Ball / The Ball\u201d). While greeting guests Rudolf again meets Mary, but this time they talk and share a dance. Rudolf surprises Mary with his knowledge of Julius Felix's articles and his understanding of their message (\u201cMarys Walzer / Mary's Waltz\u201d). St\u00e9phanie sees the two together but has grown so used to Rudolf's increasing infidelity that she doesn't stop them. Rudolf expresses his wish to see Mary again before she leaves (\u201cDer Ball (reprise) / The Ball (reprise)\u201d).\n\nAfter the ball, Rudolf, Wilhelm II and Edward, Prince of Wales , visit a brothel. Wilhelm and Edward both leave with prostitutes, but Rudolf can only think of Mary. Elsewhere, Mary thinks about Rudolf. Neither can fight the feeling that their meeting meant so much more than met the eye (\u201cSo viel mehr / Something More.\u201d)\n\nThe next day, Taafe meets with Mr. Moriz Szeps , the editor of the newspaper responsible for printing the writings of Julius Felix, and demands he stop printing the articles. Unsure of Szeps\u2019 cooperation, Taafe orders the destruction of the newspaper's editorial office (\u201cDie Strahlende Zukunft / Blue Skies\u201d).\n\nIn the destroyed office, Rudolf secretly meets with Szeps and his associates. The men declare that they have written up a new constitution for a free and liberal Europe and try to convince Rudolf to sign the document (\u201cZeit zu Handeln / Finish What You've Started\u201d). Rudolf is hesitant to sign, not wanting to commit high treason against his father. The men agree to give Rudolf time to make his decision. Once left alone, Rudolf wonders if he can find the strength to go against his father (Wohin f\u00fchrt mein Weg? / How Will I Know?\u201d).\n\nMary then enters the office, looking to deliver a letter for Julius Felix. Rudolf reads the letter, which states Mary\u2019s desire to meet Felix. Rudolf reveals that he is, in fact, secretly Julius Felix. Mary is shocked, but elated, and the two spend the evening ice-skating (\u201cTralala / The Tra-La-La Ice Skating Song\u201d).\n\nRudolf informs Mary that they are being watched by Wiligut, one of Taafe's spies, and suggests that they play a little joke on him. Rudolf and Mary pretend to flirt with each other, teasing Wiligut, but actually begin to fall in love in the process. (\u201cIn dem moment als ich dich sah / The Moment I Saw You\u201d). Rudolf tells Mary of the one place where his life is not complicated and he can write the dreams of Julius Felix: Mayerling . Mary asks that Rudolf take her there some day.\n\nTaafe meets with Franz-Joseph to discuss the renewal of Austria's alliance with Germany . When Franz-Joseph asks of Julius Felix, Taafe divulges new intelligence that puts Rudolf under suspicion; but Franz-Joseph does not believe his son could be responsible. Rudolf overhears and fears exposure.\n\nRudolf wanders the streets aimlessly and is discovered by Mary. When Mary asks what is wrong, Rudolf unhappily replies that, while being with Mary has made him happier than he has ever been, he can no longer see her. Mary affectionately convinces Rudolf to put his fears aside and accept the fact that he loves her. The two share a kiss and begin their affair (\u201cVertrau in uns / Only Love\u201d).\n\n### Act II\n\nThat night, Rudolf suffers a nightmare in which he is tormented and Mary is hanged by a gleeful Taafe and a troupe of masked minions (\u201cDie F\u00e4den in der Hand / The Master of the Strings\u201d).\n\nRudolf awakens from the nightmare screaming Mary's name. Mary, who has spent the night with Rudolf, rushes to his side. Rudolf is visibly stirred but Mary is able to comfort him back to calmness. As Mary prepares to leave, Rudolf gives her a ring engraved with the phrase, \u201cUnited in love until death.\u201d Mary sadly insists that she will never be able to wear it, but Rudolf promises her that she will be able to wear it in Mayerling; until then Rudolf has Mary wear the ring on a chain around her neck so that it may be, \u201cthe companion of your heart.\u201d\n\nSuddenly St\u00e9phanie enters the bedroom, causing Mary to run out embarrassed. St\u00e9phanie asks Rudolf what makes Mary different from his past affairs. When Rudolf answers that he loves Mary, St\u00e9phanie flies into a rage promising Rudolf that no matter how much he loves Mary he will never be rid of her and she will be crowned and revered as Empress of Austria (\u201cDu bleibst bei mir! / It Will Be Me!\u201d).\n\nRudolf writes to the Pope , asking that his marriage to St\u00e9phanie be annulled , angering his father. When Franz-Joseph denies the annulment Rudolf threatens to relinquish his title as Crown Prince. Franz-Joseph promises that if Rudolf does so, harm will befall Mary and her family. Franz-Joseph then commands his son to forsake his petition to the Pope and to make no more public appearances. Saddened, Rudolf tells of the torment the burdens of being a prince bring him and expresses his wish to live as an ordinary man (\u201cWie jeder andere Mann / An Ordinary Man\u201d).\n\nRudolf returns to the brothel to wallow in a drunken depression. The prostitutes try to seduce Rudolf but he is not in the mood, going so far as to pull out a gun to scare them off (\u201cWiener Schm\u00e4h (reprise) / Viennese Specialties (reprise)\u201d). When a young new customer arrives, all of the prostitutes shift their attention to him, sharing their vast knowledge of lovemaking (\u201cMein s\u00fcsser Held / New Boy in Town\u201d).\n\nMary startles Rudolf by appearing in the brothel dressed like the prostitutes. When Rudolf asks her what she is doing there, a visibly hurt Mary retorts that she had spent two weeks looking for Rudolf and when she found him in the brothel she thought that he favored the prostitutes over her, prompting her transformation. Rudolf swears that the prostitutes mean nothing to him, and tries to make Mary understand that he avoided her for her own safety. Mary affirms that she is willing to take the risk, and asks Rudolf when he will be ready to do the same.\n\nMary leaves and Rudolf contemplates suicide. However, Rudolf has an epiphany and instead proclaims that he is ready to stand up against his father and fight for the rights of his people (\u201cMut zur tat / Measure of a Man\u201d).\n\nThe following day, Rudolf makes a surprise public appearance at an assembly hosted by Taaffe, who was opening a new Viennese exhibition. Rudolf gives a rousing speech to the masses, promising an innovative future in which all citizens will be treated equally, infuriating Taaffe (\u201cDer Weg in die Zukunft / The Steps of Tomorrow\u201d).\n\nMarie witnesses the speech and fears that while Rudolf may seem victorious at the moment, his doom is closing in (\u201cDie Liebe lenkt / Only Heroes Dare\u201d).\n\nMary enters a church and runs into St\u00e9phanie. Mary tries to apologize for the affair, but St\u00e9phanie firmly states that while she may always forgive Rudolf she will never forgive Mary. Mary desperately asks St\u00e9phanie why she hates her so much, to which St\u00e9phanie tearfully replies, \u201cBecause he loves you so much.\u201d Mary leaves a weeping St\u00e9phanie alone to pray.\n\nWilligut reports to Taaffe that he saw Rudolf and Mary enter a building with Szeps, and that Rudolf remained with Mary long after Szeps had left. Taafe deduces that it is Mary that is giving Rudolf his new-found courage and plots to separate her from the Crown Prince. Taafe summons Mary to his office and offers a large sum of money and a new estate in Milan for her and her family, if she will call off her affair with Rudolf. Mary bluntly refuses and Taafe promises a bitter end for the two lovers (\u201cWenn das Schicksal dich ereilt / The Writing's on the Wall\u201d).\n\nRudolf visits Marie and asks her to pass on a letter to Mary insisting that she leave Vienna for her safety; for Rudolf plans to commit high treason by signing Szeps\u2019 constitution. Marie does so, pleading with Mary to fulfill her duty to her family by marrying the Duke of Bragan\u00e7a. Lost in the sorrow of their separation Rudolf and Mary remember their time together, still aching for so much more (\u201cSo viel mehr (reprise) / Something More (reprise)\u201d).\n\nRudolf signs Szeps\u2019 constitution and hands it over to a servant to deliver to Szeps\u2019 associates. However, Rudolf is betrayed and the document is delivered straight into the hands of Taaffe, who in turn hands it over to Franz-Joseph (Zeit zu Handeln (reprise) / Finish What You've Started (reprise)\u201d). The broken Emperor summons his son and convicts him of high treason, stripping Rudolf of his rank and titles before disowning him. Meanwhile, Mary boards a train out of Vienna.\n\nRudolf runs to the train station, hoping to catch Mary before she leaves, but it appears that he is too late. Rudolf falls to his knees in tears, until he sees Mary approaching. Mary reveals she decided not to leave because she simply could not bear the thought of leaving Rudolf. With all of their hopes and dreams dashed, Rudolf and Mary pronounce each other as the only thing they have left in life (\u201cDu bist meine Welt / I Was Born to Love You\u201d). The two lovers decide that, \u201cIt is better to die all at once than to die a little every day,\u201d and form a murder-suicide pact . On January 30, 1889 Rudolf finally takes Mary to Mayerling where, after sharing one last kiss, he shoots and kills her before turning the gun on himself (\u201cVertrau in uns (reprise) / Only Love (reprise)\u201d).",

        "title": "The Phantom Tollbooth",
        "description": "The Phantom Tollbooth is a children's fantasy novel written by Norton Juster , with illustrations by Jules Feiffer , first published in 1961 . The story follows a bored young boy named Milo who unexpectedly receives a magic tollbooth that transports him to the once prosperous, but now troubled, Kingdom of Wisdom. Along with a dog named Tock and the Humbug, Milo goes on a quest to the Castle in the Air seeking the kingdom's two exiled princesses, named Rhyme and Reason. As Milo learns valuable lessons, he finds a love of learning in a story full of puns and wordplay, such as exploring the literal meanings of idioms .\n\nIn 1958, Juster had received a Ford Foundation grant for a children's book about cities. Unable to make progress on that project, he turned to writing what became The Phantom Tollbooth , his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. Jason Epstein , an editor at Random House , bought the book and published it. The Phantom Tollbooth received rave reviews and has as of 2021 sold almost five million copies, far more than expected. It has been adapted into a film , opera, and play, and translated into many languages.\n\nThough the book is on its face an adventure story , a major theme is the need for a love of education ; through this, Milo applies what he has learned in school, advances in his personal development, and learns to love the life that previously bored him. Critics have compared its appeal to that of Lewis Carroll 's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and to L. Frank Baum 's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . Additionally Maurice Sendak , in his introductory \"An Appreciation\" included in editions of the book since 1996, quotes a critic as comparing The Phantom Tollbooth to Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress : \"As Pilgrim's Progress is concerned with the awakening of the sluggardly spirit, The Phantom Tollbooth is concerned with the awakening of the lazy mind.\"",
        "synopsis": "Milo is a boy bored by the world around him; every activity seems a waste of time.  He arrives home from another boring day at school to find a mysterious package. Among its contents are a small tollbooth and a map of \"the Lands Beyond\", illustrating the Kingdom of Wisdom (which will also guide the reader from its place on the endpapers of the book). Attached to the package is a note \"For Milo, who has plenty of time.\" Warned by an included sign to have his destination in mind, he decides without much thought to go to Dictionopolis, assuming this is a pretend game to be played on the floor of his room. He maneuvers through the tollbooth in his electric toy car and instantly finds himself driving on a road that is clearly not in his city apartment.\n\nMilo begins with Expectations, a pleasant place where he starts on Wisdom's road. In Expectations, he seeks directions from the Whether Man, who is full of endless talk. As Milo drives on, he daydreams and gets lost in the Doldrums, a colorless place where nothing ever happens. Milo soon joins the inhabitants, the Lethargarians, in killing time there, a pastime angrily interrupted by the arrival of Tock, a talking, oversized dog with an alarm clock on each side (a \"watchdog\"), who tells Milo that only by thinking can he get out of the Doldrums. Head abuzz with unaccustomed thoughts, Milo is soon back on his road, and Tock joins him on his journey through Wisdom.\n\nMilo and Tock travel to Dictionopolis, one of two capital cities of the divided Kingdom of Wisdom and home to King Azaz the Unabridged. They meet King Azaz's cabinet officials and visit the Word Market, where the words and letters are sold that empower the world. A fight between the Spelling Bee and the blustering Humbug breaks up the market, and Milo and Tock are arrested by the very short Officer Shrift. In prison, Milo meets Faintly Macabre, the Not-so-Wicked Which (not to be confused with Witch), long in charge of which words should be used in Wisdom. She tells him how the two rulers, King Azaz and his brother, the Mathemagician, had two adopted younger sisters, Rhyme and Reason, to whom everyone came to settle disputes. All lived in harmony until the rulers disagreed with the princesses' decision that letters (championed by Azaz) and numbers (by the Mathemagician) were equally important. They banished the princesses to the Castle in the Air and, since then, the land has had neither Rhyme nor Reason.\n\nMilo and Tock leave the dungeon. King Azaz hosts them at a banquet where the guests literally eat their words, served to them on plates. After the meal, King Azaz lets Milo and Tock talk themselves into a dangerous quest to rescue the princesses. Azaz flatters the Humbug into being their guide, and boy, dog and insect set off for the Mathemagician's capital of Digitopolis as they must gain his approval before they can begin their quest.\n\nAlong the way, they meet such characters as Alec Bings, a little boy suspended in the air who sees through things and who will grow down until he reaches the ground. He then meets the world's smallest giant, the world's biggest dwarf, the world's thinnest fat man, and the world's fattest thin man, who turn out to just be one regular man. Milo then loses time in substituting for Chroma the Great, a conductor whose orchestra creates the colors of the world.\n\nThey meet a twelve-sided creature called the Dodecahedron , who leads them to Digitopolis. There, they meet the Mathemagician, who is still angry at Azaz and who will not give his blessing to anything that his brother has approved. Milo maneuvers him into saying he will permit the quest if the boy can show the two have concurred on anything since they banished the princesses. To the number wizard's shock, Milo proves that the two have agreed to disagree , and the Mathemagician gives his reluctant consent.\n\nIn the Mountains of Ignorance, the journeyers contend with demons like the Terrible Trivium and the Gelatinous Giant. After overcoming obstacles and their own fears, they reach the Castle in the Air. Princesses Rhyme and Reason welcome Milo and agree to return to Wisdom. Unable to enter the castle, the demons cut it loose, letting it drift away, but Milo realizes Tock can carry them down because 'time flies'.\n\nThe demons pursue, but the armies of Wisdom arrive and repel them. Rhyme and Reason heal the divisions in the old Kingdom of Wisdom, Azaz and the Mathemagician are reconciled, and all enjoy a three-day celebration.\n\nMilo says goodbye and drives back through the tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens the next day with plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, \"For Milo, who now knows the way.\" The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding direction in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for there is so much to do right where he is.",

The story is based on the 1942 novella by Eudora Welty of the same name , with a Robin Hood -like hero; the adaptation placed it in a late 18th-century American setting. The musical ran on Broadway in 1975 and again in 1976.",
        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nIn modern times, Jamie Lockhart and the other people involved tell of their ancestors, and the time dissolves to 18th-century Mississippi (\"Once Upon The Natchez Trace\").\n\nClemment Musgrove, the wealthiest planter on the Natchez Trace arrives in town only to have all of the townsfolk trying to steal his money. He finally makes it to a hotel, trying to escape the greedy townsfolk with  a little rest. Little Harp, a largely unsuccessful robber, plots with his brother, Big Harp, who is only a head that he keeps in a briefcase, about how they can steal Musgrove's money, eventually devising a plan in which they kill him in his sleep (\"Two Heads\"). Robin Hood -like Jamie Lockhart, a legendary character in Mississippi folklore , rescues Musgrove from the Harp gang by tricking Little Harp into thinking that he killed them and their ghosts attack him. Grateful, Musgrove invites Jamie to his home for dinner and for the chance to meet and woo his greatest treasure, his daughter, Rosamund. Jamie reveals to the presumably curious audience why he did not steal Musgrove's money right there, claiming that he steals with more finesse than that of a lowly crook, covering his face with berry juice and calling himself The Bandit Of The Woods (\"Steal With Style\")\n\nMeanwhile, we meet Musgrove's bitter second wife, Salome, who is making food for her husband's return from his two-week trip. She calls for Rosamund, the bane of her existence, to get herbs from out in the Indigo field. Rosamund, meanwhile, is in her own little world, dreaming of a man who will love her and call her name (\"Rosamund's Dream\"). Rosamund eventually goes out to get the herbs and Musgrove returns home, bringing gifts for his wife such as a feather duster and sewing needles, while he brings for Rosamund a dress sewn with gold. Rosamund returns home without the herbs but rather with a story of a panther causing her to lose all of them. Despite Salome's wishes that Musgrove stops babying Rosamund, he forgives her instantly and gives her the dress. In her bitterness, Salome sings of how everyone prefers the lily bud to (\"The Pricklepear Bloom\"). Salome goes out into town where everyone hates her and hires a boy named Goat to follow Rosamund back into the indigo field and kill her, taking a scrap of her new dress as proof.\n\nRosamund, donning her new dress, goes back to the woods to look for herbs, per Salome's request, and woes her empty, loveless life as Goat follows her (\"Nothin' Up\"). There, she meets The Bandit Of The Woods who requests that she completely undress and give him her dress. Rosemund does so willingly, asking if he wishes for anything else, but he leaves her there to return home naked. She does so and Musgrove is shocked but Salome is only upset that her plan was unsuccessful. Rosamund returns again to the woods later and follows The Bandit Of The Woods, intrigued by him (\"Deeper In The Woods\").\n\nIn preparations for Jamie Lockhart coming, Salome tells Rosamund to take care of the house, which she does willingly (\"Company's Comin'\"), hoping that she will look a mess by the end of it and Jamie won't be interested, leaving her to be with her Bandit Of The Woods. Finally, Jamie comes to the Musgrove estate and is greeted by Salome, dressed to the nines who immediately is entranced by his looks and pursues him sexually. Rosamund then tries to make herself out to be crazy to him and Musgrove tries to make the best of the situation and set up Jamie and Rosamund for marriage (\"Riches\"). Jamie agrees to think about it and give Musgrove his answer on Wednesday. Rosamund returns to the woods and goes to The Bandit's home\u2014which Jamie encourages (\"Little Piece Of Sugar Cane\")--finds her dress, puts it on, and fixes the place up. Jamie sings of how girls giving themselves to him takes all the fun out of it and how he prefers to steal it (\"Love Stolen\"). He knocks her out and the two of them end up in bed together.\n\n### Act Two\n\nJamie and Rosamund wake up together and she wishes to him that he would show her his face and that they could know each other's names, but he refuses, telling her that this is what he wishes love to be. He tells her that he is to be engaged to an heiress and that that is business, while this is pleasure. Meanwhile, Salome speaks again to Goat, clarifying that he needs to follow Rosamund\u2014who Musgrove believes to be kidnapped and missing by The Bandit Of The Woods\u2014and kill her in order to get his payment. After that Goat runs in to Little Harp, who is aching for a woman and offers Goat many things, including Big Harp, in order to give Rosamund to him rather than Salome (\"Poor Tied Up Darlin'\").\n\nSalome stumbles upon Jamie's cabin and finds Rosamund. Rosamund reveals to her that The Bandit will abandon her if she tries to see him without the berries and Salome advises her to do it, hoping that that will be the end of them. Rosamund leaves to do that, leaving Salome alone in the cabin. Little Harp comes to the cabin and reveals that Jamie and The Bandit are one and the same. He mistakes Salome for Rosamund and kills her (\"Goodbye Salome\"). Rosamund, now armed with a mixture to remove the berry juice, comes back and is assaulted by Little Harp. Jamie comes in and saves her, killing Little Harp. Unsettled by the murder Jamie rests at Rosamund's insistence, and she goes to remove the berry juice (\"Sleepy Man\"). She realizes who he is and wakes him up, excited that they can be both married and in love. Jamie, however, is furious and refuses, stalking out and telling her it's over. Rosamund grapples with her hate and love for him, eventually deciding to go find him. As she leaves, Jamie runs back, saying that he's changed his mind, but it's too late and they can't find each other (\"Where, Oh Where Is My Baby Darlin'?\").\n\nThen Rosamund runs into Goat, who upon being asked, reveals that Jamie is a ghost who died 9 months ago. Rosamund says that's about right, revealing her very pregnant belly. However, she continues to look for him, being harassed by townsfolk all the while (\"Pass Her Along\"). She winds up going into labor and having twins, a boy and a girl. She soon finds Jamie and tells him that their kids are named Clementine and Jamie Jr. Jamie is surprised but happy and they get married. Just after, they find Rosamund's father, who hasn't seen her since she went missing and tells her of her stepmother's death and how happy he is for them. He gives Jamie a little money, though he is already wealthy, and no longer a crook. And everyone lives happily ever after (\"Finale\").",

Based on the Book of Exodus with songs from the DreamWorks Animation 1998 film of the same name , the musical follows the life of Moses from being a prince of Egypt to his ultimate destiny of leading the Children of Israel out of Egypt . Starting from a workshop in 2015, the first production was mounted in 2017 in California. A London West End production debuted in 2020.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn Ancient Egypt , more than 3,000 years ago, the Hebrews labor, desperate for deliverance from slavery. Egyptian soldiers, under orders to kill all Hebrew firstborn boys, snatch babies from their mothers' arms. Yocheved sings a last lullaby to her newborn, then places him in a basket and sets it out on the Nile , where it drifts into the Queen's pleasure garden. Queen Tuya is there with her infant son, Ramesses II , but when she finds the new baby in the bulrushes, she decides to adopt him and names him Moses (\"Deliver Us\").\n\n18 years later, high-spirited teenagers Moses and Ramses race their chariots , destroying the marketplace and part of a temple , infuriating the high priest , Hotep (\"Faster\"). Afterwards, their father Pharaoh Seti I berates Ramses for his irresponsibility (\"One Weak Link\") and tells him he must marry the arrogant and ambitious Princess Nefertari as a political alliance. Moses defends Ramses to his father, but left alone, he wishes he could leave a mark on the world as his brother will one day (\"Footprints on the Sand\").\n\nSome months later, Seti returns from a desert campaign against the rebellious Midianites (\"Seti's Return\"). To celebrate his victory, Seti gives Ramses a captured Midianite girl as his slave, Tzipporah (\"Dance to the Day\"). Later that evening, Tzipporah breaks away from her guards and winds up in Moses' bedchamber, where she defiantly says she will always be free and escapes. Moses pursues Tzipporah into the marketplace, where he runs into Miriam , his real sister, and his brother Aaron . Miriam tells him the truth about his birth, and when he refuses to believe her, she sings him their mother's lullaby, which stirs old memories in Moses. Distraught, he races back to the palace, but cannot escape his memories. He finds artwork of the Hebrew babies being drowned by Seti's men, and the Pharaoh sadly confirms that he had to make the sacrifice for the good of Egypt. Tuya finds him and tells him the truth: he is a Hebrew, but now he must forget that and continue to live as he always has, and Moses agrees (\"All I Ever Wanted\").\n\nThe next day, Moses is with Ramses and Hotep at the temple worksite. He attempts to act as if nothing has changed, but when he sees a guard whipping a Hebrew slave, he attacks the guard and accidentally kills him. Hotep proclaims that Moses must be punished. Moses runs off and Ramses pursues him, saying he will hide the truth of Moses' identity. Moses says that isn't possible and runs into the desert (\"Make It Right\"). Barely surviving (\"Moses in the Desert\"), Moses encounters the Midianites, led by their High Priest Jethro, who welcomes him into their tribe and tells him their philosophy (\"Through Heaven's Eyes\").\n\nAs the time passes, Moses and Ramses miss one another (\"Faster\" reprise), but Moses has become a shepherd and fallen in love with Tzipporah, Jethro's daughter, whom he has re-encountered (\"Never in a Million Years\"). Then one day, following a stray sheep, Moses encounters a miraculous burning bush and hears the voice of God commanding him to return to Egypt and free his people. Moses sets off with Tzipporah as, back in Egypt, Seti dies and Ramses is crowned Pharaoh (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n### Act II\n\nMoses returns to Egypt (\"Return to Egypt\") and confronts Ramses, now married to Nefertari and the father of a son, Amun-her-khepeshef . Ramses agrees to free the Hebrews if Moses will come back to court as his adviser (\"Always On Your Side\"), and the exultant Moses informs the Hebrews they have been freed (\"Simcha\"), but Hotep then appears, holding a royal decree that doubles the Hebrews' work load. Under the influence of Hotep and Nefertari, Ramses has broken his promise to Moses. The Hebrews angrily drive Moses away (\"Deliver Us\" reprise).\n\nMoses finds Ramses sailing down the Nile on the royal barge, and warns him that if he does not keep his promise, Egypt will suffer. When Ramses refuses, the waters of the Nile are turned to blood , and further plagues of disease, fire and darkness ravage Egypt. Urged by Tuya to make peace with his brother, Moses pleads with Ramses to free the Hebrews, but Ramses will not relent (\"The Plagues\"). The final plague occurs, the death of the Egyptian first born, including Ramses' and Nefertari's son. Moses is devastated by the death and destruction he has caused (\"For the Rest of My Life\"). Ramses tells Moses that the Hebrews can go, while Nefertari grieves over the dead body of their son (\"Heartless\"). Moses tells Miriam the Hebrews are finally free, but he is too distraught to lead them. Miriam and Tzipporah, along with the freed Hebrews, revive his spirits (\" When You Believe \").\n\nMoses leads the Hebrews to the edge of the Red Sea , where Tzipporah mourns the fact that she will never see her family again (\"Never in a Million Years\" reprise). Suddenly, the Egyptian army appears in the distance, led by Ramses and Hotep, and the Hebrews appear to be trapped. Needing a miracle to escape, Moses holds out his hand and the Red Sea parts. The Hebrews pass through the Red Sea while Moses remains to offer himself as a ransom to Ramses for the Hebrews' freedom. Hotep urges Ramses to kill Moses, but Ramses refuses, saying there has been too much death, and he will be the weak link, breaking the chain of destruction. Moses and Ramses embrace, brothers once again, and then Moses and Tzipporah follow the Hebrews. Hotep commandeers the Egyptian army and pursues Moses and the Hebrews into the parted Red Sea, but once the Hebrews have reached safety, the waters fall back, drowning Hotep and the soldiers. On opposite sides of the Red Sea, Moses and Ramses face their separate destinies, knowing that they will always have a brother who supports and understands them (\"Act II Finale\").",

Inspired in part by the 2002 novel The Frog Princess by E. D. Baker , the story is a modern adaptation of the German folk tale \" The Frog Prince \" as collected by the Brothers Grimm . The film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements , and written by Clements, Musker and Rob Edwards . It stars the voices of Anika Noni Rose , Bruno Campos , Michael-Leon Wooley , Jim Cummings , Jennifer Cody , John Goodman , Keith David , Peter Bartlett , Jenifer Lewis , Oprah Winfrey , and Terrence Howard . Set in New Orleans during the 1920s, the film tells the story of a hardworking waitress named Tiana who dreams of opening her own restaurant. After kissing prince Naveen, who has been turned into a frog by the evil voodoo witch doctor Facilier, Tiana becomes a frog as well and the two must find a way to turn human again before it is too late.\n\nThe Princess and the Frog began production in July 2006, under the working title The Frog Princess . It marked Disney's brief return to traditional animation , as it was the mainstream animation studio's first traditionally animated film since Home on the Range (2004). Musker and Clements, directors of Disney Animation's The Great Mouse Detective (1986), The Little Mermaid (1989), Aladdin (1992), Hercules (1997), and Treasure Planet (2002) returned to Disney to direct The Princess and the Frog .

        "synopsis": "In 1926, New Orleans , a young woman named Tiana dreams of opening a restaurant. She works two waitress jobs to earn money, leaving no time for a social life. Meanwhile, the arrogant Prince Naveen of Maldonia arrives in town, and intends to marry Tiana's wealthy best friend, Charlotte La Bouff, because his parents have cut him off from the family fortune. Charlotte's father, Big Daddy, hosts a masquerade ball in Naveen's honor. Charlotte asks Tiana to make beignets for the party, paying her enough to buy an old mill to convert into her restaurant. Naveen and his valet , Lawrence, encounter Dr. Facilier, an evil voodoo witch doctor who plans to rule New Orleans. Facilier transforms Naveen into a frog and Lawrence into a doppelganger of Naveen, using a voodoo talisman containing Naveen's blood. Facilier intends for the disguised Lawrence to marry Charlotte, then kill her father with a voodoo doll so he can gain the La Bouff fortune. At the ball, Tiana learns she has been outbid for the mill and accidentally spills food on her outfit, so Charlotte lends her a princess costume. Feeling disheartened, she begins wishing on a star when Naveen appears. Mistaking Tiana for an actual princess, he asks her to kiss him to break the spell, offering her a financial reward. Tiana reluctantly agrees to save her restaurant, but she is instead transformed into a frog as well. The two are chased into a nearby bayou , where they meet a jazz-loving anthropomorphic alligator named Louis. When they explain their predicament, he suggests they seek the help of Mama Odie, another voodoo practitioner who lives in the bayou.\n\nThe trio come across a Cajun firefly named Ray who helps them find Mama Odie's abode. During the journey, Tiana and Naveen begin developing romantic feelings for each other, especially after Naveen learns to be more responsible. Meanwhile, when the talisman containing Naveen's blood runs out, Facilier asks his \"friends on the other side\" (a legion of voodoo spirits) to help retrieve Naveen, offering them the souls of the city's population once he succeeds in taking over, and they grant him an army of shadow demons for his bidding. Mama Odie confirms that only Naveen kissing a princess can break the spell. Tiana realizes that since Charlotte's father has been crowned Mardi Gras king, Charlotte will be a princess until midnight. The group hitches a ride on a steamboat back to New Orleans, during which Naveen tells Ray about his love for Tiana and plans to propose marriage to her. After talking to Tiana, Naveen selflessly decides against proposing, since transforming him and Tiana into humans and financing Tiana's restaurant is contingent on him kissing Charlotte. The shadow demons capture Naveen and bring him to Facilier to replenish the talisman with Naveen's blood. After Ray tells Tiana of Naveen's love for her, Tiana heads to the Mardi Gras parade to find Naveen, only to see the disguised Lawrence marrying Charlotte.\n\nRay rescues the real Naveen and steals the talisman, but is mortally wounded by Facilier, who then offers to make Tiana's dream come true in exchange for the talisman. Refusing to dishonor her father, Tiana destroys the talisman, leading the voodoo spirits to drag Facilier into their world for failing to pay back his debt. After Lawrence is arrested, Tiana reveals her love to Naveen. Charlotte agrees to kiss Naveen, but the clock strikes midnight before she can do so. Ray dies and is reincarnated as a star during his funeral. Tiana and Naveen are wed by Mama Odie and then restored to human form when they kiss, since Tiana is now truly a princess. They return to New Orleans and open their restaurant, named Tiana's Palace.",

Jim Marvin, a young dandy , enters through the window followed by a troupe of young people (\"Let's Make a Night of It\"). Jim's polo team has won a silver cup, and he's brought all his friends to George's house to celebrate. Jim is surprised to find that George is not home; George never goes out at night. However, Jim decides to continue the party and goes into the dining room with his friends to find some food and drink.\n\nGeorge is not home because he has eloped with Lou Ellen Carter. They return to the apartment ready to spend their first night together (\"You Never Knew About Me\"), not realizing they have guests. They go into the bedroom, and Jim and his friends return to the living room, not knowing George is home with Lou Ellen. Jim rhapsodizes on the wonders of an available female (\"A Package of Seeds\"). George and Lou Ellen overhear the noisy guests and open the door. They see no one, as everyone is now in the dining room, but George notices the telegram. It is from his Quaker Aunt Penelope, who controls his portion of the family fortune. She cautions him not to become engaged to Lou Ellen without careful consideration and tells him that she is coming to visit. George and Lou Ellen decide that Lou Ellen will have to go back to her parents for a while. Lou Ellen tries to sneak out through the party by pretending that she is one of the partiers. The girls ask her to go with them to their next party, but she explains that she is \"An Old-Fashioned Wife\". The landlord insists that the party must end, and everyone leaves, as George and Lou Ellen go to find a taxi to take her home.\n\nJim is left alone in the apartment when a pretty girl with a gun enters and explains she is escaping from the police. She is an actress named Jackie Sampson, and she was at a party at the Cherrywood Inn when a tipsy old gentleman named Tootles made a pass at her. He climbed on a table to read a speech, got into an altercation with a constable and started a riot. In the confusion, Jackie lost her handbag and gave the policeman a black eye. The policeman, P. C. Simms, has come to arrest her, but Jim tells him Jackie is George's wife. Jim offers to go back to the cabaret, find her handbag, and make Tootles absolve Jackie of any blame. Jackie thanks him (\"A Pal Like You\"), and they decide she should spend the night at George's to support her alibi. George can stay at Jim's place. She puts on Lou Ellen's pajamas. George returns and begins a letter to Lou Ellen (\"Letter Song: I'll Just Dream About You\") when Jackie emerges from the bedroom and explains her situation. George agrees to let her stay, and when Simms returns, George shows him the wedding certificate to prove he is married and reintroduces him to Jackie, who is still wearing the pajamas. Simms decides everything is in order and leaves, and Jackie can stay \"Till the Clouds Roll By\". George spends the night on Jim's sofa.\n\nWhen George returns home in the morning, Lou Ellen's father, Judge Carter, has come to see if George is a suitable son-in-law. Jim has invited more of his friends to George's apartment, and the Judge finds it hard to believe George is really a serious young man. George invents a story about unstable explosives that frightens Judge Carter away. A flapper sings and dances for George (\"A Little Bit of Ribbon\") before Jackie emerges. Meanwhile, Jim could not find Tootles or the handbag, but he has found Tootles's speech. Briggs goes to the train station to waylay Aunt Penelope. Lou Ellen and her mother arrive and are shocked at the apparently immoral behavior going on in the apartment. When Jackie accidentally mentions that she has stayed there all night, George tells them she is his Aunt Penelope. Jackie tries to convince them she is a Quaker (\"The First Day in May\"). Judge Carter returns, and Jackie recognizes him as Tootles!  She decides to follow him to the Country Club , where he is going to give his speech for the Polo Trophy. Hopefully he'll be able to clear her name with the police and get her handbag back.\n\n### Act Two\n\nAt the Medowsides Country Club, Jim and his friends begin the trophy ceremony with a song (\"Koo-La-Loo\"). Briggs is frantically searching for George. He tried to lock Aunt Penelope in the kitchen, but she punched him in the eye and escaped. When George and Jackie arrive, Simms greets them as Mr. and Mrs. Budd and asks them where Jackie got her pajamas; he would like to get a pair for his wife. Jackie tells Jim that even though she is becoming fond of George, she also likes him (\"Rolled Into One\"). Mrs. Carter dislikes George and persuades her husband to forbid Lou Ellen to speak to him (\"Oh Daddy, Please\").\n\nJackie tells the judge that she will give him his speech if he will get her handbag back from Simms. Jim asks Jackie to think about marrying him (\"Nesting Time in Flatbush\"). Jackie orders a strong drink to fortify her to be George's wife, his aunt, and a flapper simultaneously. Lou Ellen is despondent because she cannot speak to George, but she reassures herself that \"Words Are Not Needed\". Aunt Penelope arrives, and Simms tells her George and Jackie are married; he saw her in pajamas. Aunt Penelope feels faint and asks for a glass of water but accidentally takes Jackie's drink. Soon inebriated, she asks George about the pajamas, and he sends her to the ladies' room. Jackie, Jim, and George sing an extemporaneous piece about \"Flubby Dub the Caveman.\"  Lou Ellen meets Aunt Penelope in the ladies' room, and Aunt Penelope tells her about the pajamas. Lou Ellen asks her mother to make George explain who was wearing her pajamas and who Jackie is, since Aunt Penelope is George's aunt.\n\nAunt Penelope spots Briggs and declares that he is a madman who tried to lock her up. Simms jumps at the chance to arrest him and rushes to empty his hands, giving Jackie's handbag to Judge Carter. Judge Carter and Jackie exchange the handbag and the speech. Aunt Penelope demands an explanation: did she dream all the strange happenings, and is George really married?  George explains to everyone that he is married to Lou Ellen. Simms is thoroughly confused, but George tells him that Jackie is Jim Marvin's wife, and it is quite certain that she soon will be.",

Despite receiving some positive reviews, the show closed after 91 performances.  A Broadway revival opened in November 2014, and closed after 56 performances.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe Boss, the ringmaster of a sideshow, introduces the exhibits: the bearded lady , a geek , the Cannibal King, the seraglio of a Hashemite sheik , and, lastly, his star attraction, the Siamese twins (\"Come Look at the Freaks\"). Buddy Foster, an aspiring musician, brings Terry Connor, a press agent and talent scout for the Orpheum Circuit , to see the Siamese twins, persuading him to enter the show all the way. Coerced ominously in by the Boss, Buddy thinks he could help them create an act and convinces Terry to meet them. The two men interrupt a birthday party for the girls (\"Happy Birthday To You And To You\").\n\nTerry asks their names and they respond, \"I'm Daisy\" and \"I'm Violet\". He then asks them their dreams (\"Like Everyone Else\"); Violet, the gentler of the two, wants a life of a husband and home; Daisy, on the other hand, seeks fame and fortune. Terry tells them he wants to help their dreams come true (\"You Deserve a Better Life\"). After the Boss rudely refuses Terry's offer to be cut in on the twins' potential vaudeville career (\"Crazy, Deaf and Blind\"), Terry devises a scheme whereby Buddy will teach the girls a song. Jake, who plays the Cannibal King in the sideshow and is the twins' friend and protector, begs them to consider what they're getting into and the whole sideshow family adds its opinion (\"The Devil You Know\").\n\nTwo weeks later, Terry returns to see the twins perform and Buddy tells him how the personal dynamics with the girls are getting sticky (\"More Than We Bargained For\"). Before their secret late-night performance, the twins confess to each other how infatuated they are with the two men who've come into their lives (\"Feelings You've Got to Hide\").\n\nThe Hilton Sisters' secret debut is a great success (\"When I'm By Your Side\"). But the Boss discovers the subterfuge and physically threatens the twins when they tell him they're leaving the sideshow. Jake comes to their rescue and the other attractions threaten to leave also, causing the Boss to back down. Daisy, Violet and Jake, whom Terry has invited to help backstage on the twins' tour, bid farewell to their sideshow family (\"Say Goodbye to the Freak Show\").\n\nIt's time for the twins' first public performance, and Terry invites a group of reporters together before the show (\"Overnight Sensation\"). Before their vaudeville debut, the twins argue about their different ways of expressing interest in men (\"Leave Me Alone\"). Onstage they sing \"We Share Everything\" in a production number featuring them as queens of ancient Egypt.\n\nAfter the twins' performing triumph, Terry and Buddy shower them with kisses. Hostile reporters ask tough questions about the girls' love life (\"The Interview\"). Terry and Buddy deny any romantic inclinations, leaving the twins to wonder if they will ever find romantic fulfillment (\"Who Will Love Me as I Am?\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe second act opens with the Hilton Sisters at the height of their success - a Follies -style production number (\"Rare Songbirds on Display\"). Daisy's dream of stardom has come true but Violet seems no closer to her dream of finding a husband.\n\nAt a fancy New Year's Eve party, Buddy tries to cheer up Violet and ends up proposing marriage (\"New Year's Day\"). Afterwards, Terry imagines what it would be like to be alone with Daisy (\"Private Conversation\").\n\nIn an onstage number (\"One Plus One Equals Three\"), Buddy, Violet and Daisy issue an upbeat invitation to their wedding. But backstage both Daisy and Buddy separately express doubts as to how the arrangement will work. Jake overhears Buddy and, in an effort to save Violet from seemingly imminent heartbreak, confesses that he has loved her for years (\"You Should Be Loved\").\n\nThe night before Violet and Buddy's wedding as the grand finale of the Texas Centennial , Daisy is feeling left out. To appease her, Terry suggests going where they could be more-or-less alone together (\"Tunnel of Love\").\n\nThe big day arrives. Hawkers sell tickets and souvenirs (\"Beautiful Day for a Wedding\"). But in the dressing area, complications arise. Jake announces he is leaving. Buddy confesses he's not strong enough to marry Violet. Daisy offers a solution which will ensure a movie contract dependent on the wedding publicity (\"Marry Me, Terry\"). Terry cannot bring himself to publicly acknowledge what he feels for Daisy. She dismisses him and insists that Violet and Buddy go through with the ceremony, which will at least benefit everyone's career. Left alone, the twins find solace in each other (\"I Will Never Leave You\"). As the wedding proceeds, they reprise \"Come Look at the Freaks\" with full understanding and acceptance of who they are and what they are doing.",

        "synopsis": "Three years after the events of the second film , the original Bellas have graduated from Barden University, but they all hate their jobs. Beca and Amy, whose respective relationships with Jesse and Bumper ended some time during the three years, are now roommates along with Chloe in New York City.\n\nThey are invited alongside the remaining original Bellas by Emily, now a senior and leader of the current Barden Bellas, to an event under the impression they will be performing, only to discover they are merely guests. Disappointed, they reconvene at a bar and express how much they miss performing with each other.\n\nAubrey convinces the group to join a USO tour headlined by DJ Khaled , hoping her father will finally watch her perform. As Stacie is eight months pregnant and unable to tour, Emily takes her place.\n\nThe Bellas land at a base in Rota , Spain, greeted by liaison soldiers Chicago and Zeke. They also meet the other three bands on the tour, which use musical instruments, making the Bellas feel out of place. Chloe begins to fall for Chicago.\n\nFat Amy learns that Fergus, her estranged father (who is also a ruthless international crime lord), has found her at their hotel. The Bellas are invited to a party at DJ Khaled's suite, where Beca develops a friendship with DJ Khaled's music producer, Theo, who is impressed when she easily produces a mix of her singing on Khaled's editing equipment.\n\nMoments later, the party is thrown into chaos when Aubrey accidentally starts a fire. Meanwhile, Amy sneaks off to a poker tournament, which is revealed to be a ruse by Fergus in order to get back into Amy's life, which she agrees to after believing he has changed.\n\nWhile the Bellas are recovering from ruining DJ Khaled's party, Stacie calls to inform them that she has given birth to a girl, whom she has named Bella. The news inspires the group to continue performing, and their shows go down very well with the troops.\n\nFergus and Amy gradually make up, until he accidentally reveals that he is only trying to acquire her US$190 million offshore account created by Amy's mother, causing Amy to disown her father. Meanwhile, DJ Khaled asks Beca to open for him without the other Bellas. Beca declines the offer and returns to her room, and doesn't tell the group she was asked.\n\nThe Bellas (without Beca and Amy) are abducted and taken aboard Fergus' yacht, as an attempt to manipulate Amy. When she and Beca learn of the kidnapping, they sneak on board. Beca distracts Fergus by leading the Bellas in a performance of \" Toxic \" while Amy sets up and detonates a bomb.\n\nThe Bellas escape the yacht, and Fergus is later arrested. After the Bellas are rescued by the military, Amy reveals DJ Khaled's proposition to Beca to the others. They encourage her to take the chance, agreeing that it is time to move on with their lives. They know they will stay connected to each other as a family.\n\nAt the final USO performance, Beca opens for DJ Khaled, then brings the Bellas onstage to sing their final performance \u2013 \" Freedom! '90 \". Gail and John, the public announcers when the Bellas originally competed, have filmed a Bella documentary, only to be appalled when John realises they did not record the Bellas' final performance.\n\nNow the Bellas' lives are improving: Amy uses her new bankroll for tributes to singers named Amy; Aubrey works as a birthing coach; Flo's juice cart becomes an international brand; Chloe gets into vet school; Cynthia-Rose enlists in the USAF flight school; Emily returns to Barden and her songwriting; Lilly reveals that she was quiet because she was possessed by Satan, the bomb snapped her out of it, and her real name is Esther, and starts a relationship with DJ Dragon Nutz; Aubrey reconnects with her father; Chloe and Chicago become an item; Beca is now Theo's boss.",

When she is made aware of the situation, Liz offers to settle his account and move him, his assistant Arturo, and his prized horses to Philadelphia if he will marry Beth, and he agrees to accept her offer.\n\nBack in the States, complications arise when Liz finds herself falling in love with the Duke while Beth finds she is attracted to Sandy.

He is a young nobleman and the son of an old war comrade of Erminie's father.  Erminie and Ernest have never met each other.  Erminie, however, is secretly in love with her father's secretary, Eug\u00e8ne, and Ernest is secretly in love with Cerise Marcel, who is Eugene's sister and Erminie's friend.  Eug\u00e8ne and Cerise are orphans who were taken into his household by Erminie's father.  Eugene feels that his subservient position makes it impossible for him to ask the Marquis for Erminie's hand in marriage.\n\nOn his way to the betrothal ceremony, Ernest runs into a pair of crafty \"philanthropists\" (thieves), Ravennes and Cadeau, who steal his money and wardrobe and tie him to a tree.  They disguise Ravennes as Ernest and Cadeau as a Baron and blunder into the Lion d'Or for the betrothal, saying that they were waylaid by thieves.  Seeing the wealthy wedding guests, they scheme to make off with a lot of money.  Cadeaux gets drunk, however, and his bad manners nearly spoil the scheme.  Ernest eventually escapes his bonds and arrives late and in disordered attire at the Lion d'Or.  Seeing Ernest, Ravennes cries \"Seize the villain,\" claiming that Ernest is the thief who attacked them earlier in the day.  Ernest is arrested and tossed in jail.\n\nAt the Chateau Pontvert that evening, Ravennes, still disguised as Ernest, pretends sympathy for Erminie's love for Eugene.  He promises to help her to elope.  At the same time, she unwittingly helps him to rob the house and the wedding guests.  Eventually, however, in a farcical comedy of errors and mistaken identities, the plan fails, and the robbers are arrested.  Nevertheless, their scheming inadvertently rescues Erminie from the arranged marriage, as both pairs \u2013 Eugene and Erminie, and Ernest and Cerise \u2013 are happily united.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nMrs Wormwood gives birth to Matilda, but the new mother is only worried about a ballroom dancing contest she has missed. Similarly shallow, Mr Wormwood\u2014a used-car salesman and television addict\u2014dismisses the child when he realizes she is a girl (\"Miracle\"). Five years later, Matilda is an avid reader and lives unhappily with her parents. The Wormwoods are oblivious to her genius and frequently mock and verbally abuse her. Matilda adds some of her mother's peroxide to her father's hair oil, leaving Mr Wormwood with bright green hair (\"Naughty\").\n\nAt the library, Matilda spends time with the kind librarian Mrs Phelps and makes up a story about a world-famous acrobat couple who cannot have children (\"Once Upon a Time\"). Matilda has her first day at school (\"School Song\"). Her teacher Miss Honey instantly sees that Matilda is exceptionally intelligent and decides to request that Matilda be moved to the top class (\"Pathetic\"). However, the child-hating and tyrannical headmistress Miss Trunchbull dismisses Miss Honey's suggestion (\"The Hammer\").\n\nMatilda's father takes out his career frustration on Matilda, so she puts superglue around the rim of his hat. At school, Matilda is told of Miss Trunchbull's cruel punishments, including the Chokey: a tiny cupboard lined with sharp objects in which she locks disobedient children for hours (\"The Chokey Chant\"). Miss Honey meets Mrs Wormwood and her dance partner Rudolpho. Mrs Wormwood mocks Matilda's interest in books and intellect (\"Loud\"). Miss Honey is desperate to help Matilda but feels powerless to do so (\"This Little Girl\").\n\nContinuing her story, Matilda explains that the acrobat is pregnant, but her sister refuses to cancel the show and refund tickets, and produces a contract binding them to perform the act or go to prison (\"The Great Day Arrived\"). At school, Miss Trunchbull attempts to accuse Matilda of eating a chocolate cake she had been saving, but quickly learns that the student who ate the cake was Bruce Bogtrotter. As punishment, she forces him to eat the entire cake as the rest of the students watch him, half of them anticipating that he'll eat the entire cake, while the others are doubtful (\"Bruce\"). Even though Bruce manages to finish the entire cake, Miss Trunchbull still sends him to the Chokey.\n\n### Act II\n\nMr Wormwood advises the audience against reading in favour of watching television (\"Telly\"). Matilda's classmates sing about their hopes (\"When I Grow Up\"). Matilda tells Mrs Phelps more of the story of the acrobat. Bound by their contract, she performs her act but is fatally injured, living just long enough to give birth to a girl. Her husband invites the acrobat's sister to move in and look after his daughter. The girl's aunt is secretly cruel (\"The Trick Started Well\").\n\nMr Wormwood is pleased because he tricked his Russian customers (\"I'm So Clever\"). Matilda scolds him, so he locks her in her bedroom. Matilda continues the story of the acrobat's daughter. The aunt locks her in the cellar, where the father finds her. Filled with rage, he chases the aunt but is never seen again (\"I'm Here\").\n\nThe next day, Miss Trunchbull forces Miss Honey's class to undergo a gruelling physical education lesson (\"The Smell of Rebellion\"). Miss Trunchbull bullies the children, then verbally abuses Matilda, but Matilda discovers she can move objects with her mind (\"Quiet\"). Matilda demonstrates her powers to Miss Honey who tells of her own cruel and abusive aunt, who looked after her as a child after her parents died. When Miss Honey first became a teacher, her aunt produced a bill detailing everything Miss Honey consumed as a child, along with other expenses, and forced her to sign a contract binding her to pay it all back. Desperate to escape, Miss Honey found refuge in an old farm shed (\"My House\"). Matilda recognizes Miss Honey's scarf from the story of the acrobat\u2014which she realizes is the true story of Miss Honey's childhood, and that her wicked aunt is Miss Trunchbull.\n\nMiss Trunchbull schemes to punish Lavender, but her classmates try to intervene. Matilda uses her powers to write on the blackboard posing as the ghost of Miss Honey's father (\"Chalk Writing\"). Miss Trunchbull runs away and the children celebrate (\"Revolting Children\").\n\nMiss Honey receives her parents' house and money, and she becomes the new headmistress. Matilda can no longer use her powers. The Wormwoods try to escape with Matilda to Spain but the Russian mafia arrive. Sergei is impressed by Matilda's intellect, and he lets them go (\"This Little Girl\" reprise).

        "description": "I Do! I Do! is a musical with a book and lyrics by Tom Jones and music by Harvey Schmidt which is based on the Jan de Hartog play The Fourposter . The two-character story spans 50 years, from 1895 to 1945, as it focuses on the ups and downs experienced by Agnes and Michael throughout their marriage. The set consists solely of their bedroom, dominated by the large fourposter bed in the center of the room.",
        "synopsis": "Act One\n\nA bedroom, complete with four-poster bed, chaise longue and easy chair. There are two dressing tables downstage on either side. Michael and Agnes sit at the tables, getting dressed for their wedding. They finish their makeup and don their wedding apparel. They move through the ceremony, complete with Agnes throwing the flowers and the two going out into the audience to shake hands and welcome guests. Finally, Michael carries Agnes back across the threshold and they fall into the bed (\"Prologue\").\n\nAgnes' feet hurt. Michael removes her shoe and kisses her foot. Agnes protests; a little drunk, a little weepy and very nervous. Michael professes his belief that they were married in a former life, and his sweetness makes her cry. We get a glimpse of the Michael that we will soon get to know when he ruins her happy moment by pointing out to her that she should go ahead and cry, as her youth is over. They nervously and elaborately prepare for the wedding night. They climb clumsily into bed and pull the covers back to find, to their horror, a pillow embroidered with the words, \"God Is Love.\" Michael awkwardly turns out the light. They say goodnight to each other, and Agnes admits that she's never seen a naked man (\"Goodnight\"). There is an uncomfortable silence. Finally, they kiss and embrace passionately.\n\nA spotlight comes up on Michael, sitting on the lip of the stage. He stretches and smiles and tells the audience a surprising secret: contrary to conventional wisdom, he actually loves his wife (\"I Love My Wife\"). He wakes her and they dance together. He falls asleep, and she puts the \"God Is Love\" pillow under his head, tucks him in and kisses him. The music becomes soft and tender as Agnes straightens the room. She folds his clothes and puts them away, gets the robe that is hanging at her dressing area and slips into a new outfit. We see that she is very, very pregnant. She ruminates on impending motherhood (\"Something Has Happened\").\n\nIn the following blackout, we hear an old-fashioned, hand-rung bell as Michael calls for Agnes. He is in bed with a washcloth on his head as she enters \u2013 still hugely pregnant \u2013 pushing a bassinet. Michael is having sympathetic labor pains and is very needy and upset. He already feels displaced by the baby to come. Sitting on his lap, Agnes goes into labor. As Michael goes for the doctor, they promise to each other that they will never let anything happen to their relationship.\n\nLights come up on Michael pacing, worrying and praying that his wife and baby survive (\"The Waiting Room\"). All is well; Michael has a son. He tosses cigars into the audience. Agnes enters, pulling a clothesline strung with diapers and baby clothes. Michael now realizes that he has a family for whom he needs to provide (\"Love Isn't Everything\"). Agnes then has a girl. Now Michael knows that he really needs to make money. Despite the stress, love isn't everything... but makes it all worth it. The tension between Agnes and Michael starts to become palpable. Michael has become very self-involved and self-important about his work and success as a novelist. He treats her as a lowly domestic as he lectures the audience on writers and writing, themes and works. She interrupts him in the middle of his diatribe and calls his work dull. He corrects her grammar, criticizes her cooking and habitual lateness, insisting that she accompany him to literary parties at which she feels uncomfortable. She counters that she also has a list of irritating habits (\"Nobody's Perfect\").\n\nThey return from the party and argue bitterly. He admits to having an ongoing affair with a younger woman. He blames Agnes for driving him away. He also points out that everyone knows that men get better with age and women get worse (\"A Well Known Fact\"). Agnes exits in disgust, and Michael finishes the song, making a fast, showy exit, a matinee idol in all his glory. In response to Michael having criticized her shopping habits, Agnes starts parading the extravagant items on her dressing table. She fantasizes about what her life would be like if she were a saucy, single divorcee, partying the night away (\"Flaming Agnes\").\n\nMichael reappears to finish their discussion. She tells him to get out; he refuses, since, he claims, it is his house and his mortgage. She resolves to leave, taking the checkbook with her. He begins throwing her things into a suitcase: her alarm clock, her nightgown, her cold cream and the \"God Is Love\" pillow. Their eyes are now wide open about each other... and it isn't pleasant (\"The Honeymoon Is Over\").\n\nShe stalks out, with her ermine thrown over her nightgown, with the Flaming Agnes set determinedly on her head. He waits for a moment, certain of her return. When she doesn't come back, he rushes after her. We hear a struggle and he reappears, dragging her into the room. They fight and he throws her on the bed. His anger dissipates. Looking at her pleadingly, he tells her of his loneliness and regret. Her eyes fill with tears and she acknowledges that no one is perfect (\"Finale \u2013 Act I\"). They lie together and embrace.\n\nAct Two\n\nAgnes and Michael are in bed, celebrating New Year's Eve . The \"God Is Love\" pillow is gone, as is the gaudy chandelier. Time has passed; their children are teenagers now, celebrating at New Year's Eve parties of their own. Agnes and Michael are getting older (\"Where Are the Snows?\"). Michael is angry that their son hasn't returned and goes downstairs to wait for him. He storms back into the room, having found bourbon in his son's room. They argue about parenting, and Michael takes a swig from the bottle, only to discover that their son has filled the bottle with the cod liver oil that his mother thought she was administering for three years. We hear that, offstage, Michael has confronted his son at the door with the razor strap, only to discover that his boy is a man, dressed in his father's tuxedo.\n\nMichael and Agnes reflect on the dreams and regrets of their early married years. Agnes asks Michael if he is disappointed. He is not (\"My Cup Runneth Over\"). They fantasize about their children growing up and moving out. They make plans for their middle age and retirement: he'll finally finish his Collected Tolstoy; she'll cruise to Tahiti and learn to do the hootchi-koo; he'll play the saxophone, she the violin (\"When the Kids Get Married\").\n\nLater, Michael is dressing with little success for his daughter's wedding. He is not pleased with his little girl's choice of husband (\"The Father of the Bride\"). Agnes enters, crying. The stained glass window appears again, and Michael and Agnes watch the ceremony. They wave to the departing couple and go home to face an empty nest.\n\nAgnes faces her transition to middle age. She doesn't know what to be now that her children no longer need her as much (\"What Is a Woman?\"). Michael enters the scene with two packages, but Agnes announces that she's going away; she doesn't love Michael anymore. She feels that he neither understands nor appreciates her, and reveals her infatuation with a young poet. Michael confesses his love and concern for his wife. He shows her that he loves her, and she breaks down, laughing and crying at once. He gives her a charm bracelet with a charm for each of them, one for each of their children and room for many grandchildren. She feels much better. They dance together and multi-colored ribbons cascade from above (\"Someone Needs Me\").\n\nThe music changes, becomes softer and more carousel-like as, together, they pick up the boxes and papers. They begin to pack up the house (\"Roll up the Ribbons\"). The music continues as they go to their dressing tables and apply old-age makeup, wigs and whiten their hair. It's eight a.m., and the much older Michael and Agnes are moving to a smaller apartment. They are gathering the last bits and pieces to take along with the movers. He pulls out a steamer trunk and finds the \"God Is Love\" pillow. Agnes wants to leave the pillow for the newlyweds who have bought the house, but Michael refuses. He was mortified to find it on their wedding night and won't have another young groom traumatized. Agnes sends Michael to look for a bottle of champagne and sneaks the pillow back under the covers. Michael returns with the champagne, but they determine that they won't drink it, since it is too early. They look at each other across the bed and remember what a good life they've had (\"This House \u2013 Finale\").\n\nThey take a last look around and leave the room together. Michael comes back in for the champagne and finds the \"God Is Love\" pillow under the covers. He puts it on Agnes' side of the bed and the champagne on his side before exiting. The curtain falls on the home.",

        "description": "Rachael Lily Rosenbloom (And Don't You Ever Forget It) is a musical with a book by Paul Jabara and Tom Eyen , and music and lyrics by Jabara (with some songs having additional lyrics by David Debin and Paul Issa ).\n\nThe convoluted plot revolves around the misadventures of the title character (whose first name sports the extra \"a\" dropped by Barbra Streisand from her own) and her journey from a Brooklyn fish market to fame as a Hollywood gossip columnist , and then a career culminating in an Academy Award nomination and a nervous breakdown. The score is a mix of disco and more traditional Broadway show tunes.\n\nJabara had written the show specifically for Bette Midler , who passed on the project. Eyen was brought in to overhaul the book and replace original director Ron Link, and Grover Dale was hired to assist Tony Stevens with the choreography. Ellen Greene was cast as Rachael Lily Rosenbloom.  Jabara himself played the lead male role of Joey; Anita Morris was the second female lead.\n\nThe Broadway production began previews on November 26, 1973. Within days, it was obvious to everyone involved that it was beyond repair. On December 1, a small notice in the local newspapers announced the show would be closing that night, prior to its official opening.\n\nThe demand for tickets was immediate. Theatre buffs who revel in the calamitous as much as the classical were determined to see what was destined to go down in the Broadway annals as one of the all-time biggest flops. When the curtain went up that night, the cast was facing a sold-out house. Frank Rich of the New York Times noted that the musical had a small hardcore group of fans who had followed its evolution from the beginning and already had seen it several times: \"In scattered pockets throughout the otherwise shell-shocked house were claques of theatergoers who sang along with the musical numbers and gave mini-standing ovations at the end of most of them.\"\n\nProducers Robert Stigwood and Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn lost all of their $500,000 investment in the production. In addition to Ellen Greene in the title role, the cast included Jabara, Wayne Cilento , Anita Morris (who married assistant choreographer Grover Dale ), Thommie Walsh , and Andr\u00e9 DeShields . The play was mentioned in passing in the liner notes of Paul Jabara's The Third Album . [ citation needed ]\n\nIn January 2017, Feinstein's/54 Below announced it would revive the musical, with the support of Jabara's family, for two concert stagings on March 13, 2017.

The first, The Little Comedy , is based on a short story by Arthur Schnitzler and explores the budding relationship between two people who have adopted personas other than their own. Set in late 19th century Vienna , it focuses on Josefine, a demimondaine weary of the social life provided by her upper class lovers, and wealthy playboy Alfred, who has tired of a seemingly endless round of inconsequential affairs. She assumes the guise of a working class woman, while he pretends to be a struggling poet , and the two meet while enjoying their new identities. Whether or not they can survive a weekend in the country with their usually glamorous trappings replaced by inedible food, bad wine, swarming insects, and total boredom is the question to be answered.\n\nSummer Share , the second act based on Jules Renard 's 1898 play Le pain de m\u00e9nage , is updated to the late 1980s and set in The Hamptons , where two married couples in their thirties are spending the season in a rented cottage. Sam, who is married to Barb, and Monica, who is married to Lenny, find themselves gradually progressing from harmless flirtation to the serious possibility of an illicit affair.",

Inspired by the recent Silver Jubilee of George V of Great Britain, the story is of the royal family of a fictional European country. Several of its songs, especially \" Begin the Beguine \" and \" Just One of Those Things \", became independently popular and have become part of the American Songbook .\n\nThe musical opened on Broadway in October 1935, in the midst of the Great Depression .  It had strong reviews and was considered \"one of the great theatrical events of the 1930s.\" It ran for 169 performances. Although the original arrangements were lost after 1948, beginning in 1986 the musical was reconstructed. It has been produced by several companies in New York, London and elsewhere.",
        "synopsis": "Time: 1935\n\nPlace: In and Around London, England and Rockwell-On-Sea\n\n### Act I\n\nWhen the curtain rises a ball is being hosted at the Royal Palace by the Royal Family (\"Our Crown\"). The King (Henry) and the Queen (Katherine) are sitting in the throne room, ignoring the guests, as the Prime Minister attempts to convince them to come to the Ball. The Queen is reading a movie magazine and suggests that the picture \"Mowgli and the White Goddess\", which features swimmer Charles Rausmiller as the scantily-clad Mowgli , be shown at the Jubilee. The King then suggests that he could perform his string trick and Prince James and the Princess (Diana) come in with their own requests. Prince James would like to have American Dancer Karen O'Kane come to the Jubilee, and the Princess would like songwriter/actor/playwright Eric Dare to receive Jubilee honors. The Prime Minister denies their requests and the Royal Family is finally summoned to the ball after the guests begin to steal ashtrays, and the tassels off the curtains. Meanwhile, the young Prince Peter and his cousin Prince Rudolph scheme to be able to visit Radio City Music Hall so while the Cabinet is meeting, they throw a rock through the window, with a message attached to it. It reads: \"If the Royal Family is not out of the Palace by midnight, we will come and take them out. This is our first and last warning\". The Prime Minister alerts the Royal Family that they will be evacuated to the dreary Feathermore Castle, but they decide \"to Hell with Feathermore!\" and that they will do something they've always wanted to do (\"We're off to Feathermore\"). The Princess decides to visit Eric Dare (\"Why Shouldn't I?\") who is currently being greeted by a crowd of admirers (\"Entrance of Eric\") after returning from exotic travels (\"The Kling-Kling Bird on the Top of the Divi-Divi Tree\"). The Princess requests an autograph from Eric, who becomes intrigued with Diana after she proves herself more thoughtful than the rest of his crowd of admirers (\"When Love Comes Your Way\"). Meanwhile, in a Municipal Park (\"What a Nice Municipal Park\"), the King is practicing his string trick, which is seen by socialite and party planner Eva Standing, who drags him off to be an attraction at her next party. The Queen, with the help of a man dressed as an ape, finds the theater where \"Mowgli and the White Goddess\" is playing (\"When Me Mowgli Love\") and meets Charles Rausmiller at the stage door, asking him to help her with her breaststroke, to which he agrees (\"Gather Ye Autographs While Ye May\"). At the Cafe Martinque, (\"My Loulou\"), Prince James is watching Karen O'Kane perform (\" Begin the Beguine \"). He meets her and together they win a cash prize for the best-danced Beguine. Meanwhile, the King has been staying at Eva's place preparing his party trick, while Eva attends to her schedule of social appearances (\"Good Morning Miss Standing/My Most Intimate Friend\"). The prime minister has been searching with all the means at his disposal for the Royal Family, but has had no luck. He just misses the King and Queen at the pool where Mowgli and the Queen have been doing their swimming lessons. The King believes that they are now running a risk of being caught, as he was photographed outside a news office. Meanwhile, Karen and Prince James have been comfortably living with each other for the past few days (\"A Picture of Me Without You\"). At a grand, Greek-themed party thrown by Eva (Ev'rybod-ee Who's Anybod-ee\"), the Royal Family meet again. Two classical dances are performed, one of them featuring Karen (\"The Judgment of Paris\" and \"Aphrodite's Dance\"). News breaks out that the Royal Family is missing, and to calm the crowd Eva says that the Royal Family is in this very room and there is no need to worry (\"Swing that Swing\"). The Prime Minister demands the Royal Family step forward; they do, and they are dragged off to Feathermore, \"that very nasty castle in the North\" (\"Finale Act One\").\n\n### Act II\n\nIt is a rainy Sunday morning at Feathermore (\"Sunday Morning Breakfast Time\"). The Royal Family has invited all of their friends from the past week to the Castle, as they couldn't stand the dull routine practiced at Feathermore. When their friends arrive, they decide to abdicate the throne and run off to Rockwell-on-Sea before going to America (\"Mr. and Mrs. Smith\"). At Rockwell-on-Sea (\"Six Little Wives\"), both the Queen and the Princess win \"Miss Rockwell 1935.\" The Prime Minister comes to them, dragging along Prince Peter and Prince Rudolph, revealing that there was no threat; they will return to the Palace for the Jubilee. Everyone bids their friends goodbye (\"A Picture of Me Without You\" (Reprise)). The King and Queen cheer up by listening to a favorite old song of theirs (\"Me and Marie\") before being arrested for bathing nude. As the prison burnt down, they are put in lion cages. With James' help, they knock out the zookeeper with a version of the King's string trick and escape. Meanwhile, Eric Dare and the Princess tearfully say goodbye (\"When Love Comes Your Way\" (Reprise)), and Karen and Prince James share their last dance (\" It Was Just One of Those Things \"). At the Jubilee, Eric, Karen, Eva, and Charles are awarded Jubilee honors and the two young Princes are allowed to go to Radio City (\"Our Crown\" (Reprise)). The King attempts to perform his string trick, but resorts to singing \"Me and Marie\" instead, as the curtain falls on the joyful scene (\"Finale Ultimo\").",

        "description": "Someone Like You is a musical with a book by Robin Midgley and Fay Weldon , lyrics by Dee Shipman , and music by Petula Clark .\n\nBased on a concept developed by Clark and Ferdie Pacheco over a period of several years, it is set in West Virginia immediately after the end of the Civil War . Originally entitled Amen , it was conceived as a dark view of the difficulties Southerners faced dealing with carpetbaggers during the Reconstruction period, and also dealt with the problems of morphine -addicted Confederate soldiers returning home. It lost many of its serious overtones as the project evolved; Clark and Shipman's original book was revised substantially by Weldon (who also contributed the new title), and the plot became convoluted, often bordering on the ridiculous. Shipman later stated, \"For all the faults there were in the original book . . . it was better than the hybrid we ended up with because it had passion.\"\n\nThe story centers on Abigail Kane, who journeys to America from her native England with her son Andy in search of her preacher husband, who allegedly had gone to the States to participate in the skirmish between North and South. She comes to the aid of the Major, a doctor struggling to care for a multitude of injured soldiers without the benefit of medical supplies, and soon discovers her missing husband is involved in shady dealings not usually associated with a man of the cloth. Drawn together out of both necessity and desire, Abigail and the Major forsake their marital vows and become involved in a passionate romance.\n\nDirected by Midgley , the musical premiered on 25 October 1989 at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in Cambridge , and in his review in the Cambridge Evening News , Alan Kersey wrote, \"Petula Clark proved last night at the world premiere of Someone Like You that she can still work wonders both on stage and in the tough real world of show business.\" The production toured the UK through 9 December.\n\nOn 22 March 1990, Someone Like You opened at the Strand Theatre in London 's West End . In addition to Clark, it starred Dave Willetts ( The Phantom of the Opera ) as the Major, Clive Carter as Kane (roles in which Clark had hoped Andy Williams and Sting would be cast) and Lewis Rae as Andy. Reviews were mixed, although most critics praised Clark's performance and her contribution to the score.\n\nDue to financial difficulties faced by producer Harold Fielding , all his assets were seized, and the show closed without warning after the 25 April performance. Although an original cast album was never released at the time, Clark's recordings of several of the tunes were issued on various CDs throughout the ensuing years.\n\nA studio recording of the score was released by Sepia Records in May 2007. With arrangements by the show's original musical director and arranger, Kenny Clayton , it features vocals by Debi Doss , Andrew Derbyshire , and Lewis Rae , who appeared in the original production as young Andy.

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nHarry Potter rejoices that he is entering his second year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with his best friend Ron Weasley and nerd Hermione Granger (\"Goin' Back to Hogwarts\"). Headmaster of Hogwarts Albus Dumbledore welcomes everyone back, skips the Sorting Ceremony and reintroduces the House Cup Tournament, in which a champion will be chosen on behalf of each House ( Gryffindor , Ravenclaw , Hufflepuff , and Slytherin ) to fight for the House Cup. Professor Severus Snape chooses the champions out of a magical trophy to be Harry (Gryffindor), Harry's crush Cho Chang (Ravenclaw), her current boyfriend Cedric Diggory (Hufflepuff), and Harry's obnoxious rival Draco Malfoy (Slytherin). No one can drop out due to the enchantment on the trophy.\n\nDraco attempts to intimidate Harry by claiming that he will transfer to Pigfarts, a prestigious wizarding academy on Mars presided over by Headmaster Rumbleroar, a talking lion, but Hermione forces him to back off. Meanwhile, Defense Against The Dark Arts professor Quirinus Quirrell is secretly conspiring to revive the evil wizard Voldemort , who is parasitically attached to the back of his head. They bicker about this arrangement, which causes inconvenience to both of them due to their conflicting personalities (\"Different As Can Be\").\n\nHarry convinces Hermione to do all of his school work for him while he writes a love song for Cho Chang. He tests out the song on Ron's younger sister Ginny (\"Ginny's Song\"), oblivious to her own crush on him. Harry, Ron and Hermione use his Cloak of Invisibility to sneak off and investigate what the first round of the tournament entails, leaving Ginny alone to lament her unrequited love (\"Harry\"). The trio discover that the first round will involve dragons and eavesdrop on Malfoy hinting at an unrealized crush on Hermione.\n\nVoldemort convinces Quirrell to go out and celebrate the progress of their evil plan instead of grading papers. After returning from a night of drunken escapades, they reminiscence on past events and how they have become good friends from their time spent together (\"Different As Can Be (Reprise)\"). Harry continues to neglect his preparation for the tournament, and is caught off-guard when he is forced to face a deadly Hungarian Horntail in battle while his competitors fight imaginary dragons. With no other choice, Harry summons his guitar and serenades the dragon into submission, allowing him to move on to the next round (\"The Dragon Song\").\n\nThe annual Yule Ball is announced, and Ginny asks Harry to be her partner. Unfortunately, Harry is dead set on asking Cho and unknowingly rejects Ginny, causing her to run off in tears. Harry plays his song for Cho (\"Ginny's Song Reprise (Cho's Song)\") but is rejected because Cho had already agreed to go with Cedric, leaving him and Ron as the only two male students without partners. Quirrell relieves Voldemort of his worries surrounding their master plan as the two weigh the pros and cons of their upcoming physical separation. Voldemort realizes he has become close with Quirrell, and that he wishes to remain his friend.\n\nAt the Yule Ball, the normally-unattractive Hermione shows up with a gorgeous makeover, causing Ron and Malfoy to realize their feelings for her (\"Granger Danger\"). Harry develops an attraction to Ginny and asks her to dance, leaving Ron to get \"drunk\" on Butterbeer and fight over Hermione with Malfoy, causing her to lash out at both of them. Harry pulls back from a kiss with Ginny, stating that they cannot be together because of his friendship with Ron. Ginny leaves in tears and a flustered Harry attempts to regain his dignity by cutting in with Cho, causing him to get into a fight with Cedric. As they argue, they both grab an enchanted ladle planted by Quirrell, teleporting them to a mysterious graveyard.\n\nQuirrell appears, kills Cedric with the Killing Curse and uses the full Body-Bind curse on Harry. As Quirrell and Voldemort submerge themselves in a large cauldron, Snape appears and uses his own hand and Harry's blood to complete a ritual that successfully revives Voldemort, who joyfully celebrates with his followers, the Death Eaters (\"To Dance Again!\"). Bellatrix Lestrange arrives to welcome back her master and former lover and reveals their plan to use Quirrell as a scapegoat for the murder of Harry. Heartbroken, Quirrell falls out with Voldemort and is taken to Azkaban . Before Voldemort can kill Harry, Harry manages to use the ladle to escape back to Hogwarts, where he exclaims in horror that Voldemort has returned.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe Ministry of Magic doesn't believe that Voldemort's back, \ndespite proof such as Voldemort's new vlog and his review of 17 Again , with the star Zac Efron . Meanwhile, Harry, consumed by the stress this situation is causing him, pushes his friends away by acting egocentric. Malfoy tries to make fun of Harry, but he's once more humiliated in front of the student body and he promises revenge. Ginny tries to make sense of her relationship with Harry, but he explains to her that as long as Voldemort is around, they can't be together because he wants to protect her. When Ginny runs away in tears, Dumbledore in disguise calls Harry to his office to discuss Voldemort.\n\nSnape reveals himself as a Death Eater undercover and meets up with Voldemort, who's in a deep depression after his fight with Quirrell. Snape introduces Draco Malfoy to the Dark Lord, who informs him about a secret passage leading to Hogwarts in exchange for a rocket to Mars (\"Pigfarts, Pigfarts, Here I Come\"). Voldemort makes Draco sign a magical contract to make him kill Dumbledore. Harry, Ron and Hermione get to Dumbledore's office for the meeting. There, Dumbledore explains that Voldemort possesses some Horcruxes that make him immortal as long as they exist, he reveals that he has already destroyed five of the six Horcruxes and tells Harry to find the last one, hidden right there in Hogwarts. At that moment, the Death Eaters break into Dumbledore's office and arrest him. Malfoy is ready to follow through his part of the deal, but after a speech from Dumbledore he finds himself unable to give him the final blow. Snape takes the initiative and kills Dumbledore, traumatising Harry, who declares he has to kill Voldemort on his own.\n\nVoldemort successfully takes over the Ministry of Magic, but he's still sad about the loss of Quirrell. Voldemort, Quirrell and Harry lament all the people they lost (\"Missing You\"). After that, a Death Eater informs Voldemort that Hogwarts has fallen, and Voldemort gets ready to leave for Hogwarts.\n\nGinny finds Harry and tries to convince him that he has the power to save everyone, but Harry is pessimistic and he complains about all the unrealistic expectations and the pressure on him for being the \"Boy Who Lived\". Ginny reassures him that he's not alone in his fight against evil (\"Not Alone\") and he makes up with Ron and Hermione. With Malfoy's help, who regretted his choices, Harry and Ron go to Dumbledore's office to destroy the last Horcrux, while Ginny and Hermione try to contact the Order of the Phoenix . Before they separate, Ron apologises to Hermione for his behaviour at the Yule Ball and the two share a passionate kiss.\n\nHarry, Ron and Malfoy find out that the last Horcrux is Zac Efron's poster that Dumbledore kept in his office. The Horcrux tries to turn Ron against Harry by taking the form of Voldemort and Hermione and relying on his insecurities. Ron fights against it and destroys the Horcrux, rekindling his friendship with Harry.\n\nA group of Death Eaters led by Bellatrix arrives in the office, after having captured Ginny and Hermione. Snape is revealed to be Dumbledore's agent and tries to save the students, but Bellatrix kills him. At that moment Ginny and Ron's mother, Molly Weasley , intervenes and kills Bellatrix. With his last breath, Snape reveals that Harry became a seventh Horcrux the night his parents died.\n\nVoldemort has arrived at Hogwarts and demands that the student body delivers Harry to him in exchange for their lives. Harry realises that he has to die to save everyone else and he turns himself in to Voldemort, who kills him. In a realm between life and death, Harry meets Dumbledore, who explains to him that by killing Harry, Voldemort involuntarily destroyed his seventh Horcrux. Dumbledore makes Harry return to the world of the living before leaving for Pigfarts riding Rumbleroar, the lion who acts as Headmaster at the Mars school.\n\nRon and Hermione gather the other Hogwarts students and convince them to fight because that's what Harry would have done (\"Voldemort is Goin' Down\"). When Harry shows himself still alive, everybody cheers, but Voldemort bursts into the room, shocked that Harry isn't dead. Harry explains that his sacrifice made the Hogwarts' students immune to Voldemort's magic, and that Voldemort's disregard about other people is eventually going to be his demise. Voldemort tries the Avada Kedavra curse, but Harry counterattacks the spell and kills him.\n\nThe student body celebrates Voldemort's death, and Neville Longbottom finds Dumbledore's will, in which the Headmaster awards Gryffindor with the House Cup and nominates Harry as the new Headmaster. Harry kisses Ginny after Ron gives them his blessing, and all the students throw a party.\n\nAt Azkaban, Quirrell hears about Voldemort's death and he's devastated. However, the last residue of Voldemort's soul comes to make amends with Quirrell, and the two gloriously reunite (\"Not Alone (Reprise)/Goin' Back to Hogwarts (Reprise)\").",

        "description": "Zombies from The Beyond is an American musical comedy with book, music, and lyrics by James Valcq . It opened Off-Broadway on October 11, 1995, at the Players Theatre . The show examines American ideals and foibles during the era of President Dwight D. Eisenhower in a tone that is often parodistic and sometimes genuinely satiric, all following closely the structural form of grade-B space paranoia films that were popular during the 1950s.",
        "synopsis": "It's 1955. Ike is president, the economy is booming, and \"The Sky's the Limit\" at the Milwaukee Space Center. Staunch Major Malone (originally played by Michael Shelle), his aide Rick Jones (originally played by Robert Boles), secretary Charlene \"Charlie\" Osmanski (originally played by Suzanne Graff ), Deli delivery boy Billy Krutzik (originally played by Jeremy Czarniak), and the Major's unnervingly competent daughter Mary (originally played by Claire Morkin) are all abuzz at the arrival of rocket scientist Trenton Corbett (originally played by Matt McClanahan) to the Probe Seven Control Room. Via the Probe's space photography equipment, the crew makes an alarming discovery on the television monitor screen: \"A Flying Saucer\".\n\nLater at the Orbit Room Cocktail Lounge, Rick and Mary dauntlessly dance away the imminent danger (\"The Rocket-Roll\"). Trenton arrives just in time to hear the saucer buzzing the Galaxy of Coiffures Beauty Salon across the street. After impetuous Rick rushes off to investigate, Trenton attempts to calm the fears of the usually intrepid Mary (\"Second Planet on the Right\").\n\nBack in the Control Room, a top-secret scheme is hatched to launch a crewed rocket into battle with the hovering spacemobile. Charlie is inducted to measure up the men for suitable spacewear (\"Blast Off Baby\"). Billy pesters Charlie for a date, quick, before aliens conquer the city. He taps his way into her heart with his \"Atomic Feet\" and they plan to rendezvous later that night. When the brazen saucer actually lands in the beauty salon, it's \"all systems go\" for new emergency procedures: Trenton will develop a weapon of mass destruction, Rick will set up a blockade at the beauty shop, and poor Charlie will man the television monitor. Shifty Rick now reveals his true color \u2013 (red!) \u2013 as he retrieves orders via mysterious walkie-talkie to slip Charlie a mickey and make contact with the invaders for the greater glory of his homeland (\"Big Wig\").\n\nIn Mary's car, Trenton \u2013 sworn to secrecy \u2013 breaks Mary's heart when he breaks their date (\"In the Stars\").\n\nMeanwhile, at the Galaxy of Coiffures, Rick encounters Zombina (originally played by Susan Gottschalk), a buxom alien aviatrix bent on procuring he-specimens to play stud on her female-laden planet. Employing her supersonic \"Secret Weapon\" (a soprano voice so stratospheric that it zombifies), Zombina transforms Rick into a bug-eyed slave to her nefarious demands. She and her entourage of titillatingly tacky \"Zombettes\" (originally played by the rest of the cast, decked out in intentionally unconvincing 'disguises') sound the shrill soprano war-cry of \"Zombies from The Beyond\".\n\nZombina's tirade of terror has the city on pins and needles (\"Dateline: Milwaukee\"), yet Trenton and Mary are able to terminate their tiff (\"Second Planet Reprise\"). Our heroes plan to implement Trenton's newly developed 'amplificator' against subversive enemies, singing gaily: \"Don't just hate 'em, exterminate 'em, that's \"The American Way!\" Charlie emerges from her stupor and a series of spine-tingling clues leads the probe crew to a cataclysmic conclusion about Rick ('I Am a Zombie\"). Zombina herself appears on the television monitor screen and proceeds to zombify Trenton and Malone in an amazing 3-D \"broad\"-cast. Can Mary and Charlie save Milwaukee from this menace?\n\nZombina, fed up with Rick's inability to perform up to her high standards, resolves to employ her considerable wiles in perpetrating her perverse ploys (\"The Last Man on Earth\"). Running amok in historical downtown Milwaukee, she plays demolition derby with her stratocruiser and does away with Rick once and for all.\n\nIn the chilling climax high atop the Wisconsin Gas Company Building, Mary and Charlie battle it out with Zombina (\"Breaking the Sound Barrier\"), pitting their brash belting voices against Zombina's coloratura quavers. All appears lost until good old Billy arrives and joins forces with the girls by adding his Geiger-counter tap-dancing to their raucous roundelay, resulting in the hideous demise of Zombina whose formerly formidable voice drops a couple octaves (She bewails: \"What a world! I'm belting!\") Malone and Trenton are de-zombified, and Milwaukee \u2013 (what's left of it) \u2013 is saved! Stalwart Major Malone leads the survivors in a stirring hymn of patriotic paranoia, advising everyone, everywhere to \"Keep Watching the Skies\".",

Bill arrives with a homburg hat \u2014a trophy from Gorilla Baxley, a rival gang leader whom he has just \"taken care of\". The gang rejoices\u2014Bill's Beer Hall will now be the center of crime in Chicago, as great as the original Bill's Beer Hall in Bilbao (\"The Bilbao Song\") says the Governor which has since gotten very bourgeois and respectable.\n\nA policeman drops off an old lady who passed out in the street. She turns out to be The Fly in disguise, and tells them a big bank job is set for Christmas Eve, two days away. The Fly is angry that Bill murdered Baxley without her consent and signals the gang to kill him. The Fly leaves and the gang plots to frame Bill for killing the pharmacist they were planning to shake down.\n\nA Salvation Army band begins to play out on the street (\"Lieutenants of the Lord\"). Sister Lilian (or Lillian) Holiday brings the band inside the bar (\"March Ahead\"), and begins to try to convert the gang. They try to assault her and Bill comes to her rescue. When the gang and the band leaves, Lilian stays behind with Bill and tries again to reach him, singing \"The Sailors' Tango\".\n\nBrother Hannibal returns with the band and is shocked at Lilian's behavior. After finding Bill's gun there, the police burst in and arrest Bill for the murder of the pharmacist in his shop.\n\n### Act 2\n\nAt the Canal Street Mission, Major Stone is questioning Lilian's actions. She sings a reprise of \"The Sailors' Tango\". The police come to take Lilian's statement. She gives Bill an alibi: she was alone with him in the bar when the murder was committed. Brother Hannibal faints\u2014the result of an old head injury\u2014and the Major relieves Lilian of all her duties and tosses her out of the mission.

He gives BabyFace advice on being tough (\"Song of the Big Shot\").\n\nBack at the Mission, Bill arrives at the end of the service (\"Don't Be Afraid\") looking for Lilian.

Sam runs in saying Bill is out of jail and at the Mission looking for Lilian. The Governor gets his gun and goes to the Mission. Hannibal is singing \"The Liquor Dealer's Dream\". The Governor and Bill go out the door. There are sounds of a fight, a gunshot, and a splash. Bill runs in interrupting the last refrain. \"Sing that last chorus again,\" he cries and jumps out the window just as Lilian comes through the front door.\n\n### Act 3\n\nChristmas Eve\u2014Bill and the gang are preparing for the big bank job. The Professor is fiddling with some sort of two way radio and Sam is dressed as a woman. They joke with Sam who sings \"The Mandalay Song\".\n\nThe Fly's voice comes over the radio and gives the gang their instructions. Bill will be in charge of grabbing the money. As the gang leaves, Lilian enters. She is disappointed Bill has gone back to his life of crime (\"Surabaya Johnny\").\n\nBill cries at her song but says he's still tough (\"Big Shot Reprise\"). The Fly comes in disguised as a newsboy. Bill recognises her and realises he's almost missed the hold up. He runs out and Lilian storms out behind him.\n\nThe gang returns but Bill is nowhere to be found. The Fly puts the hit out on him again. \"Take care of him tonight and leave worrying about the money till tomorrow\" (\"The Ballad of the Lily of Hell\").\nLilian returns to the Mission and so does Bill. The Major wants nothing to do with either of them. The gang rushes in. Bill shows them he has the money. A cop comes in and the gang offers up the false alibis The Fly had given them. But the cop is there to question Bill about the disappearance of The Governor. The door flies open and The Governor walks in (\"Big Shot Reprise 2\"). He had only hit his head falling into a shallow part of the canal. Everyone is innocent so the policeman leaves.\n\nNow The Fly comes in, gun drawn. Hannibal shouts \"Sadie!\" It turns out that he is the Fly's long lost husband (\"In our Childhood Reprise\"). She gives him the loot which he turns over to the Major. The Major gives Lilian her job back. The Fly steps forward and says the two groups should unite to fight for the poor against the injustices of the rich (\"Epilogue: Hosanna Rockefeller\").

Mack reminisces about \"when he ran the show\", the glorious era of silent movies, thinking of his Bathing Beauties and Keystone Cops (\"Movies Were Movies\").\n\nIn a flashback, it is 1911. When Mabel, a delicatessen worker, delivers a sandwich to Lottie, the actress that Mack is filming, Lottie is unable to pay, and Mabel reacts violently.  Mabel's dramatic behaviour catches Mack's eye, and he thinks she has potential as an actress.  He offers her a part in his next film.  She initially refuses, but when she looks back on the offer, she is dazzled by the career prospects (\"Look What Happened To Mabel\").\n\nMabel is very successful and becomes a major star. Later, along with Mack's two accountants, Kleiman and Fox, who are helping to finance his projects, the film company moves to a new, larger studio, in California.  Lottie and the rest of Mack's film crew, who include the comedian Fatty Arbuckle , eagerly fantasize about moving up in the world, (\"Big Time\").  Meanwhile, Mabel has become attracted to Mack.  Mack catches her unawares while she is reciting an improvised poem, and she invites him into her train compartment for a meal.  Though he has become fond of Mabel, Mack has no time for serious romance (\"I Won't Send Roses\").  He reluctantly takes part in a mock wedding ceremony, and he and Mabel sleep together, but Mack wakes up horrified and leaves in a hurry.  Mabel is still in love with Mack, and resolves to do things his way (\"I Won't Send Roses\" (Reprise)).\n\nEventually, Mabel wants to try other genres of film.  Frank, an actor in Mack's company who aspires to bigger things, sees Mabel's potential as a serious actor, and has written a romantic drama called Molly, with her in mind for the title role.  Mabel, who is still in love with Mack and afraid of losing him, reluctantly declines.  Mack is only interested in comedy (\"I Wanna Make The World Laugh\").  Mabel eventually stands up to Mack and lobs a prop pie at him during rehearsals.  Soon the whole cast is throwing pies, and the resulting melee inspires another set of two-reelers.  Mabel regrets her childish behaviour, and the status quo is resumed.\n\nEventually,  Mabel meets a director of serious films, the smooth-talking William Desmond Taylor , whose films she has adored for years, at a hotel reception.  He is instantly attracted to her, and invites her to audition for his next film.  He informs her that he has admired her for years, and believed she deserves better than two-reelers.  Taylor informs Mabel that he has repeatedly asked Mack to loan her to his studios for one picture, but Mack has refused.  Mabel is horrified.  Taylor also invites her to dinner.  Mack tries in vain to discourage her. After a heated argument, Mabel dresses in her best clothes and puts on make-up, then goes off not only for her appointment with Taylor, but for good, as she never wants to see Mack again (\"Wherever He Ain't\").  Mack is confident that he can manage without Mabel: he made a star out of one ordinary girl, and he can make a star out of another.  With this in mind, he immediately comes up with the concept of the Bathing Beauties (\"Hundreds of Girls\").\n\nFive years after Mabel's departure, the popularity of the Bathing Beauties is waning, and Mack comes under pressure to ask Mabel back. Fortunately, Mabel has realised she still has feelings for Mack and returns to the studios.  She is welcomed with open arms by the entire film company (\"When Mabel Comes In The Room\").  Mack is so glad to have her back that he agrees to film \"Molly\", at his studio.  But he attempts to turn it into a comedy, by way of his latest creation, The Keystone Cops, (\"My Heart Leaps Up\"), and Mabel returns to Taylor.   Mack sees Mabel again as she is preparing to embark on a ship with Taylor.  Taylor shows up and Mack leaves. Taylor, sensing that Mabel might still have feelings for Mack, persuades Mabel, who is complaining of tiredness, to take heroin, saying it is a pick-me-up, which works with the magic words, \"Bye, Mack!\".  Mabel is heartbroken by everything Mack has done to her, (\"Time Heals Everything\").\n\nThe show suddenly fasts forward six years.  Talkies are all the rage, and Lottie Ames, another actress in Mack's company, has become a star (\"Tap Your Troubles Away\"), but Mabel has become a full-time drug addict and her reputation is ruined.  To add further to the tragedy, her lover, William Desmond Taylor, is murdered, and she is the prime suspect.  Mack refuses to believe Mabel is a drug addict, and finally willing to try to patch things up between him and Mabel, but it is too late - she has died.  The musical ends with a dream sequence, with Mack imagining a reconciliation between him and Mabel, (\"I Promise You A Happy Ending\" / \"I Won't Send Roses (Reprise)\").",

In 2009, the film was deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry .",
        "synopsis": "The story opens with the Muppets sitting down for a private screening of a movie that acts as an origin story of how they all met.\n\nKermit the Frog lives a simple life in a Florida swamp. After he plays his banjo and sings \" Rainbow Connection \", he is approached by Bernie, a talent agent who encourages him to pursue a career in show business. Inspired, Kermit sets off on a cross-country trip to Hollywood .\n\nHe meets Fozzie Bear , who is working as a hapless stand-up comedian, and invites him on his journey. The two set out in Fozzie's 1951 Studebaker but are pursued by entrepreneur Doc Hopper and his assistant Max, who try to convince Kermit to be the new spokesfrog of Hopper's struggling French-fried frog legs restaurant franchise. Horrified, Kermit refuses, and he and Fozzie drive away. Unwilling to accept Kermit's refusal, Hopper follows the pair and resorts to increasingly forceful means of persuasion. In an old church, Kermit and Fozzie meet the rock band Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem , and their manager Scooter , who help them disguise their car. Driving on, they meet and are joined by Gonzo and his girlfriend Camilla the Chicken , who are also interested in becoming movie stars. They trade in their failing vehicle at a used car lot, where they meet Sweetums . They invite Sweetums to come with them, but he runs away. The others drive away, only for Sweetums to emerge and reveal that he had only gone to pack his things.\n\nThe group meets Miss Piggy at a county fair and she and Kermit become love-stricken with each other. When they meet for dinner that night, Hopper and Max abduct Miss Piggy as bait to lure Kermit. When they capture Kermit, Hopper orders mad scientist Professor Krassman to give Kermit an electric lobotomy so that he would willingly perform in Hopper's advertisements, but Miss Piggy knocks out Hopper's henchmen and causes Krassman to have his brain fried by his own device. Immediately after the fight, however, Miss Piggy receives a job offer and abandons a devastated Kermit.\n\nJoined by Rowlf the Dog , the Muppets pick up Miss Piggy \u2013 who is hitchhiking on the side of the road \u2013 and continue their journey; but their car breaks down in the desert. Sitting at a campfire, the group realizes that they will likely miss the auditions the next day. Kermit wanders off, ashamed for bringing his friends on a fruitless journey, but personal reflection restores his commitment. He returns to camp, where he discovers that the Electric Mayhem have come to their rescue, having learned of their plight by reading ahead in the film's script . The Mayhem offer to drive the group the rest of the way in their bus.\n\nThe group is warned by a reformed Max that Hopper has hired an assassin, Snake Walker, to kill Kermit. Kermit decides to face his aggressor and proposes a Western-style showdown in a nearby ghost town . There, they find inventor Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and his assistant Beaker . Kermit and his friends are saved when one of Dr. Honeydew's inventions, \"insta-grow\" pills, enlarges Mayhem drummer Animal , who frightens away Hopper and his henchmen.\n\nOnce the Muppets reach the Hollywood studio, they meet executive Lew Lord, who signs them to a \"standard 'rich and famous' contract\". The first take in their attempt to perform the script goes awry when Gonzo crashes into the prop rainbow, which knocks the scenery down and an explosion blows a hole in the roof of the studio, but a real rainbow shines through the hole and illuminates all the Muppets. Joined by characters from other Henson productions \u2013 including Sesame Street , Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas , and The Land of Gorch \u2013 the Muppets sing the final verse in a reprise of \"Rainbow Connection\". As the film ends, Sweetums tears through the screen, elated that he caught up with them.",

        "synopsis": "The following synopsis is based on the Broadway version of the show.\n\n### Act 1\n\nThe show opens with J.M. Barrie dressed in black with Peter Pan and Tinker Bell (represented by a light) on stage. Barrie is thinking out loud about his life. He also is finding clarity and accepting himself (\"If the World Turned Upside Down\").\n\nTime winds back and James M. Barrie states that the story happens in London, 1903. We see a party hosted at Barrie\u2019s house by his wife Mary and himself, after the opening night of his latest play The Wedding Guest . Charles Frohman, the show's producer, is attending the party. The party-goers say that it's the \"best party of the year\", however the play failed to please the audience. Lord Canaan, a wealthy and pompous man, is also attending the party and flirts with Mary (\"All of London is Here Tonight\").\n\nA month later, Barrie meets Frohman at Kensington Garden and tells him that he is almost finished with his next play to substitute the failure that The Wedding Guest was. The Llewelyn Davies boys, Peter, Michael, Jack and George, play as pirates around the park and interact with Barrie, except Peter who sits and reads. Sylvia, their mother, tries to get them to behave, but fails, ultimately joining the play (\"The Pirates of Kensington\"). She meets Barrie and confesses that she did not enjoy his latest play as it felt that he recycled lots of elements from the previous ones. Barrie asks Peter why did he not play with his brothers, to which he responds that he finds it all silly.\n\nBack at their home, Mary is waiting for Barrie to go to a formal dinner, complaining that he is late. Barrie arrives and tells her that he met Sylvia Llewelyn Davies and her children. Mary says that Sylvia\u2019s husband died of cancer of the jaw and that her mother, Mrs. du Maurier, is very influential and thus they should invite them for dinner. Mary leaves alone for the dinner and Barrie tears his newest play up, believing it to be rubbish.\n\nThe next day, Barrie meets Frohman and the acting troupe, who are expecting to read the new play but are frustrated to discover Barrie threw it away. Frohman says that if Barrie cannot write another play fast he will find another writer. Later, Barrie meets with the Llewelyn Davies at the park. Barrie says to Peter that he started writing when he was his age to escape reality. He stimulates him and the rest of the family to use their imagination (\"Believe\"). Barrie invites Sylvia, her mother and the boys to the dinner his wife is planning.\n\nThe following month, the dinner occurs. Mrs. du Maurier tells Mary she is intrigued by Barrie\u2019s relationship with her daughter and grandsons. Frohman arrives with Lord Canaan in an attempt to persuade him to invest in their next play. Barrie gives Peter a notebook as a present, incentivizing him to write a play. During dinner, inspired by a spoon reflecting the light, Barrie claims that the light is a fairy. Bored by the grown-ups' talk, Barrie stops time with his imagination and is joined by the boys, Sylvia and the servants to have their own party (\"We Own the Night (The Dinner Party)\"). The time unfreezes and Lord Cannan leaves the party offended by Barrie's behavior. Mary scolds him telling that he is behaving like a child.\n\nMrs. du Maurier gives Sylvia and the children a carriage ride home. Sylvia talks with her mother outside, who is worried that her relationship with Barrie is hurting her prospects. Sylvia is sick and avoiding telling her boys, since her husband recently died. Sylvia wishes to spend the rest of her life living it to the fullest with her boys and contemplates the happiness Barrie has brought to her (\"All That Matters\").\n\nOn another night inside the house, the boys play in their pajamas and refuse to go to sleep (\"The Pirates of Kensington (Reprise)\"). Barrie is there and watches the boys jumping on their beds, and is inspired as they look like they are flying. They discuss what they should play and Peter suggests they pretend to be castaways and Barrie should be an Indian chief. Peter is offended as Barrie says that as the chief he would raise the castaways as his sons, claiming he is not their father. The boys fight and Sylvia sings them to sleep (\"Sylvia's Lullaby\"). Barrie confides in Sylvia that when he was Peter's age his brother died, so he knows the pain of loss. Sylvia gives Barrie a thimble, claiming it protects from pain while sewing. Barrie claims his brother went to Neverland, a place he invented where no one ever grows older (\"Neverland\").\n\nIn the theater, Barrie presents his idea based on Neverland for his play to Frohman. Frohman is outraged as he believes the concept will not attract an audience. He also alerts Barrie to comments people have been making about his relationship with Sylvia and the boys. Barrie goes home and finds Mary alone with Lord Canaan. She confronts him with his diary, where he writes a lot about Sylvia, but not about her. She leaves him. Barrie goes to the Llewelyn Davies residence to see Sylvia and the boys, but Mrs. du Maurier stops him at the door claiming Sylvia is in bed and that their relationship is hurting her. Barrie is flustered by all the different pressures he is facing (\"Circus of Your Mind\").\n\nSeemly defeated, Barrie is visited in his imagination by Captain Hook. A figment of Barrie\u2019s frustrations and strife, Hook convinces Barrie to continue with the play and write him in as the new villain. It is communicated that Hook is a villainous side to Barrie\u2019s personality, but one that he needs nonetheless (\"Live by the Hook\"). Barrie strides, in his imagination, on a pirate ship with the support of Hook and the pirates. He realizes that he doesn\u2019t need to allow anyone else\u2019s opinion to change his. If he believes in his own work, that's all that truly matters (\"Stronger\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nAt the beginning of act II, the Llewelyn Davies boys visit Barrie at the theater as the company is reluctant and confused, testing some elements of the new play (\"The World is Upside Down\"). Charles invites the actors to drink at The Swan, a tavern. Sylvia arrives to take the children home. She has heard that Mary left him. The children convince her to go with Barrie to the tavern as Elliott, Frohman\u2019s assistant, takes them home. Sylvia is afraid that she was part of the reason Mary left Barrie, but he assures her that the separation was long in the making. The two play in the empty theater stage with the shadows cast by the ghost light and try to put to words what their relationship means to each other (\"What You Mean to Me\").\n\nAt the tavern, the company is afraid the play will be a failure. Barrie arrives with Sylvia and tells Frohman that they need children in the audience, asking him to keep 25 seats to orphans. Sylvia remarks that Frohman and the actors have forgotten how to play. They reminisce about old times when they used to live more whimsical and free in their youth (\"Play\").\n\nIn the Llewelyn Davies backyard the boys prepare a play of their own, written by Peter, who is afraid he is not a real writer. His brothers tell him to be proud of what he did and encourage him based on what Barrie has been teaching them (\"We're All Made of Stars\"). Barrie and Sylvia arrive to watch the play. Barrie asks Peter permission to use his name as the protagonist. They start Peter's play, but during the presentation, Sylvia starts to cough very badly, to which she claims it is only a silly chest cold. Barrie sees blood on the handkerchief, but Sylvia refuses to pursue treatment as she does not want the boys to relieve the experience they had with their father and asks Barrie to take care of her children. Barrie takes Sylvia inside and Peter starts destroying the set of the play. Barrie comes back to check on Peter, who lashes out at him, saying that grown ups are always lying and he does not believe that his mother has just a chest cold, for something similar happened to his father. In rage, he tears his play apart from the notebook Barrie gave him. Barrie comforts him, letting him know that life can be difficult but imagination can help him escape for a bit when needed (\"When Your Feet Don't Touch the Ground\").\n\nOn opening night the company is very nervous, but Frohman encourages them as they prepare to present Peter Pan (\"Something About This Night\"). Barrie arrives at the Llewelyn Davies residence to pick up the family to see the play. Mrs. du Maurier stops him at the door and forbids him to see her daughter. George intervenes and lets Barrie in, confronting his grandmother. Sylvia is not feeling well and cannot leave the bed, so the children have decided to stay with her. Barrie decides to stay with them as well and miss the opening night to his own play. Sylvia insists that he goes and takes one of the boys with him, as she wants a full report. Michael, Jack and George insist that Peter should be the one to accompany Barrie. Before he leaves, Sylvia gifts him with his notebook, to which she pasted his play back together.\n\nAt the theater, Frohman greets the audience, while at the Llewelyn Davies' residence, Jack, George and Michael prepare to go to sleep while Sylvia and Mrs. du Maurier put them to bed. Barrie and Peter arrive with the whole cast claiming that the theater was just a dress rehearsal, for the real opening night would take place at their residence. Peter says that the main character has his name, but the real Peter Pan is Barrie himself. The company presents the show while the family watches amused as they recognize elements of their times together that inspired the play. Sylvia is sprinkled with fairy dust and flies off with Peter to Neverland (\"Neverland (Reprise)\").\n\nBarrie appears wearing the black clothes in which he started the first scene, showing that he has been mourning Sylvia. He meets Mrs. du Maurier at the park and she explains to him that Sylvia asked them to have joint guardianship of the boys in her will, which he accepts. Barrie then meets Mary accompanied by Lord Canaan. Mary praises Barrie\u2019s play while Lord Cannan acts childishly. Frohman appears next, claiming they are going to make a lot of money with the success that Peter Pan is, to which Barrie responds that he will donate all the profit to a children's hospital. Peter appear next, holding a play which he is working on. He says he is missing his mother, to which Barrie responds that he can visit her anytime he likes in Neverland. The boys appear next and Jack calls Barrie \"father\" for the first time. Mrs. du Maurier, seeing with new eyes the positive impact Barrie had on the children,  says that Sylvia will keep guiding them from Neverland and is joined by Barrie, the boys and the rest of cast in concluding that make believe can help you navigate the world (\"Finale\").",

        "title": "Very Warm for May",
        "description": "Very Warm for May is a musical composed by Jerome Kern , with a libretto by Oscar Hammerstein II .  It was the team's final score for Broadway , following their hits Show Boat , Sweet Adeline , and Music in the Air . It marked a return to Broadway for Kern, who had spent several years in Hollywood writing music for movies, including Swing Time for Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers .\n\nVincente Minnelli directed Very Warm for May , which opened at the Alvin Theatre on November 17, 1939.  It contained such favorite songs as \" All the Things You Are \", \"All in Fun\", and \"In the Heart of the Dark.\" Gerald Bordman, author of the definitive Kern biography Jerome Kern: His Life and Music , hailed the score as one of Kern's finest.\n\nBillboard magazine saw the show pre-Broadway, and was enthusiastic: \"Prophesied this venture will be a season's hit. The ballet corps keeps the audience awake and eager. Choreography is unique and excellent. Its lyrics, in numbers such as 'All the Things You Are' and 'Up in Harlem' will be taken up soon. Scenery and costumes are colorful, bizarre, and original. 'Very Warm for May' is not one show. It's a three-in-one with enough material for a couple more extravaganzas and maybe a crumb or two to spare.\"\n\nVery Warm for May ran on Broadway for two months, with June Allyson , Eve Arden , Grace McDonald , Jack Whiting , and Vera-Ellen among the performers. It closed after 59 performances. It received mixed reviews, with the New York World-Telegram calling the show \"Gay and delightful\" and finding the songs to be \"the most charming that Kern and Hammerstein have ever written\", while Brooks Atkinson, of the New York Times , yawned, \" Very Warm for May is not so hot for November\", and Robert Benchley of The New Yorker praised the show as \"Lovely to the ear and complimentary to the intelligence...unlike most musicals, (it) actually gets better and funnier as it goes on.\"\n\nPart of the lukewarm response may have been due to a book that was changed at the last minute. Very Warm for May opened out of town with a plot that had Long Island society girl May Graham fleeing threatening gangsters and hiding out with an avant-garde summer stock troupe in Connecticut. Eve Arden portrayed a dizzy society matron.  This first version of the show received rave reviews and played to sold-out houses.  Producer Max Gordon had been away when the show opened out of town and when he saw it, he hated the gangster subplot and had it removed. However, New Yorkers didn't seem to be as crazy about the summer stock story, having just seen Babes in Arms the year before.\n\nIt was a very competitive season on Broadway. One month after Very Warm for May opened, Cole Porter 's Du Barry Was a Lady , DeSylva and Henderson's George White's Scandals and Rodgers and Hart 's Too Many Girls all opened. Very Warm for May is a quintessential \"lost musical from the 1930s\" because of its enduring score by two Broadway legends and its surprisingly quick disappearance from the theatre scene.\n\nIn 1984, recordings of the original cast performances from 1939 were discovered and which were assembled to form a long playing (LP) album and thus became the oldest Original Broadway Cast Recording . With notes by Gerald Bordman, the album received a Nomination for a Grammy Award in 1985 as Best Cast Show Album. It was subsequently released as a compact disc and later became available on iTunes . The recordings, however, are actually from a promotional radio show and not an attempt to faithfully record the full score. Several songs from the show are missing, and \"All the Things You Are\" appears four times on the collection.\n\nVery Warm for May was transferred (loosely) to the silver screen for the MGM movie Broadway Rhythm ( 1944 ) with only \"All the Things You Are\" retained from the musical and the plot rewritten yet again. The actor George Murphy plays snippets of songs from the original score while seated at a piano awaiting the arrival of leading lady Ginny Simms.\n\nStephen Sondheim has cited Very Warm for May as an inspiration for his interest in the musical theater. Sondheim saw the original production at the age of nine.\n\nHammerstein refused to allow productions of Very Warm for May after Kern's death. In 1985, however, the Hammerstein and Kern estates finally authorized a performance by a small New York company, followed in 1994 by a Carnegie Recital Hall concert (with full orchestrations).  San Francisco's 42nd Street Moon theatre performed it as a staged concert a year later in 1995.  In May 2010, 42nd Street Moon produced a fully staged version at the Eureka Theatre, subsequently making it the West Coast premiere.",

        "synopsis": "Loosely based on the real-life historical figure Martin Guerre and the 1982 film The Return of Martin Guerre he inspired, the story is set in early modern France in the anti-Protestant town of Artigat , where young Martin Guerre is forced into an arranged marriage with Bertrande de Rols in order to produce a Catholic heir. Martin is unsatisfied with the marriage, complicated by the fact that a childhood friend, Guillaume, is secretly in love with Bertrande. Beaten by the priests due to his failure to consummate the union, Martin abandons his home and Bertrande to fight the Protestant Huguenots , and it is during the skirmishes that he befriends Arnaud du Thil with whom he shares his history, beginning the story at this point, seven years later, in medias res . When Martin appears to die in battle, Arnaud goes to his village to inform Bertrande of her husband's death but, mistaken for the deceased soldier by the residents, he decides to play along with their error and becomes involved with Bertrande. Aware of Arnaud's deception, Bertrande decides to keep his secret and the two discover a mutual romantic attraction while Arnaud takes the name \"Martin Guerre\" for himself. Guillaume, who had until now hoped for a chance with Bertrande romantically, becomes envious of the supposedly returned soldier. As Bertrande, secretly converted to Protestantism , also turns Arnaud to her faith, Guillaume uncovers their beliefs and so they are assaulted by a roused mob. Before Arnaud is killed, however, Benoit, the knowing village idiot , reveals that he is not truly Martin Guerre, but rather, an imposter . The authorities arrest Arnaud\u2014still claiming that he is Martin\u2014under charges of deception and at the end of the trial, Martin Guerre himself, having apparently survived the war, appears as the last witness. In prison, Arnaud, however, is freed by Martin who forgives him for stealing his identity, noting the legitimacy of Arnaud and Bertrande's love for each other. The mob, though, sets the town ablaze and Guillaume stabs Arnaud before he can escape. As Arnaud dies in Bertrande's arms, Martin and Bertrande sing mournfully about love and the two part for good. The town contemplates their own xenophobic actions remorsefully.",

It was directed by George Scribner and written by Jim Cox, Tim Disney , and James Mangold . In the film, Oliver is a homeless kitten who joins a gang of dogs to survive in the streets. Among other changes, the setting of the film was relocated from 19th-century London to 1980s New York City, Fagin 's gang is made up of dogs (one of which is Dodger ), and Sykes is a loan shark .\n\nIn late 1984 or 1985, Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg held a pitch meeting with the animation staff. After story artist Pete Young pitched the idea to adapt Oliver Twist with dogs, the pitch was quickly approved, and the film quickly went into production under the working title Oliver and the Dodger . Pre-production started with the crew reading Oliver Twist and watching the musical Oliver! , developing the film for six to nine months. After production began in 1986, 300 artists and technicians worked on the film within two and a half years of production.\n\nAlong with The Land Before Time , Oliver & Company was released theatrically on November 18, 1988. Oliver & Company received mixed reviews from critics. The music and vocal performances of celebrities were praised, while the animation, designs, its use of computer-generated imagery , and plot received divided reviews. The film however performed very well at the box office, grossing $121 million worldwide against the budget of $31 million.\n\nThe film was re-released in theaters in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom on March 29, 1996. It was released on home video in North America on September 24, 1996, on VHS and LaserDisc . A DVD edition followed on May 14, 2002, as a special edition. Oliver & Company was later released on Blu-ray Disc on August 6, 2013, to commemorate its 25th anniversary.",
        "synopsis": "Outside a shop in New York City , several orphaned kittens are put up for adoption ; all of them manage to find homes except for an orange tabby , who begins wandering the streets hoping that someone will take him in. One day, the kitten meets a Jack Russell Terrier named Dodger , who helps him steal food from a hot dog vendor before fleeing with the hot dogs, prompting the kitten to pursue him.\n\nThe kitten chases Dodger to a barge , where he watches Dodger sharing the stolen hot dogs with his friends\u2014Tito the Chihuahua , Einstein the Great Dane , Francis the Bulldog , and Rita the Saluki . Their owner, Fagin , is a petty thief indebted to Sykes , a nefarious loan shark , who gives him an ultimatum to repay the money in three days. After the other dogs encounter the kitten, they are confronted by Sykes' two Dobermanns , Roscoe and DeSoto, who threaten to eat the kitten until he claws DeSoto's nose, a deed that earns the kitten respect from Fagin and the dogs.\n\nThe next day, Fagin goes to pawn some of his stolen goods, while the dogs and the kitten try to steal more money for him. Through a theatrical ruse, the animals stop a limousine belonging to the wealthy Foxworth family, but their attempt to rob the limo fails, and the kitten is discovered by the family's child Jenny , who is worried that her parents, who are on a business trip , won't be able to return home in time for her eighth birthday . Jenny adopts the kitten, whom she names Oliver , and bonds with him, much to the jealousy of Georgette, the Foxworths' spoiled prize-winning poodle .\n\nMeanwhile, Dodger and the other dogs believe that Oliver has been kidnapped, and they go to the Foxworths' house to \"rescue\" him. With the help of Georgette, the group take Oliver back to their barge, but Oliver tells them that he wants to stay with Jenny, making Dodger feel betrayed. As Oliver attempts to return home, Fagin picks him up and recognizes from Oliver's new collar and gold name tag that he has been adopted by a wealthy family; seeing this as an opportunity to repay his debt, Fagin decides to hold Oliver for ransom , and he informs Sykes of his plan.\n\nHaving found Fagin's ransom note, Jenny and a reluctant Georgette set out to get Oliver back. She meets with Fagin, who is shocked to be dealing with a child; bothered by his conscience, Fagin gives Oliver back to Jenny freely. However, Sykes, who was watching the events take place, abducts Jenny with the intention of blackmailing her family, while ending his deal with Fagin. Oliver, Georgette, and the other dogs sneak into Sykes' warehouse to rescue Jenny with Fagin helping them escape via his trike . Sykes, Roscoe, and DeSoto chase the group into the subway tunnels where Roscoe and DeSoto are fatally electrocuted on the third rail of the subway following a battle between Oliver and Dodger, while Sykes is killed after his car collides with a train on the Brooklyn Bridge .\n\nFollowing the incident, Jenny and Oliver are reunited. They later celebrate Jenny's birthday with the dogs, Fagin, and the Foxworths' butler , Winston, who learns that Jenny's parents are returning home tomorrow. Oliver opts to stay with Jenny but promises to remain in contact with Dodger and the gang.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nA pantomime of never-ceasing activities depicts the hustle and bustle of New York City (\"Runyonland\"). Three small-time gamblers, Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Benny Southstreet, and Rusty Charlie, argue over which horse will win a big race (\" Fugue for Tinhorns \"). The band members of the Save-a-Soul Mission, led by the pious and beautiful Sergeant Sarah Brown, call for sinners to \"Follow the Fold\" and repent (\"Follow the Fold\"). Nicely and Benny's employer, Nathan Detroit, runs an illegal floating craps game . Due to local policeman Lt. Brannigan's strong-armed presence, he has found only one likely spot to hold the game: the \"Biltmore garage\". Its owner, Joey Biltmore requires a $1,000 security deposit, and Nathan is broke (\"The Oldest Established\"). Nathan hopes to win a $1,000 bet against Sky Masterson, a notoriously lucky gambler willing to bet on virtually anything. Nathan proposes a bet he believes he cannot lose: Sky must take a woman of Nathan's choice to dinner in Havana, Cuba . Sky agrees, and Nathan chooses Sarah Brown.\n\nAt the mission, Sky attempts to make a deal with Sarah; offering her \"one dozen genuine sinners\" in exchange for the date in Havana. Sarah refuses, and they argue over whom they will fall in love with (\"I'll Know\"). Sky kisses Sarah, and she slaps him. Nathan goes to watch his fianc\u00e9e of 14 years, Adelaide, perform her nightclub act (\" A Bushel and a Peck \"). After her show, she asks him to marry her once again, telling him that she has been sending her mother letters for twelve years claiming that they have been married with five children. She finds out that Nathan is still running the craps game. After kicking him out, she reads a medical book telling her that her long-running cold may be due to Nathan's refusal to marry her (\" Adelaide's Lament \").\n\nThe next day, Nicely and Benny watch as Sky pursues Sarah, and Nathan tries to win back Adelaide's favor. They declare that guys will do anything for the women they love (\"Guys and Dolls\"). General Cartwright, the leader of Save-a-Soul, visits the mission and explains that she will be forced to close the branch unless they succeed in bringing some sinners to the upcoming revival meeting. Sarah, desperate to save the mission, promises the General \"one dozen genuine sinners\", implicitly accepting Sky's deal. Brannigan discovers a group of gamblers waiting for Nathan's craps game, and to convince him of their innocence, they tell Brannigan their gathering is Nathan's \"surprise bachelor party\". This satisfies Brannigan, and Nathan resigns himself to eloping with Adelaide. Adelaide goes home to pack, promising to meet him after her show the next afternoon. The Save-A-Soul Mission band passes by, and Nathan sees that Sarah is not in it; he realizes that he lost the bet and faints.\n\nIn a Havana nightclub, Sky buys a \"Cuban milkshake\" for himself and Sarah, which contains Bacardi rum. After a long dance sequence (\"Havana\"), a fight breaks out in the nightclub, and they flee. Outside, a drunk Sarah kisses Sky (\" If I Were a Bell \"). Sky realizes that he genuinely cares for Sarah, and he takes her back to New York. They return at around 4:00 a.m., and Sky tells Sarah how much he loves the early morning (\"My Time of Day\"). They both spontaneously admit that they're in love (\" I've Never Been in Love Before \"). A siren sounds and gamblers run out of the Mission, where Nathan has been holding the craps game. Sarah assumes that Sky took her to Havana so Nathan could run the game in the mission, and she walks out on him.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe next evening, Adelaide performs her act (\"Take Back Your Mink\"). Afterwards, Nicely and Sky inform her that Nathan once again will not be making an appearance. Adelaide and Sky argue about their respective relationships and their outlooks on life. He leaves, and she sadly reflects on Nathan standing her up again (\"Adelaide's Second Lament\").\n\nBack in the Mission, Sarah admits to Arvide and Martha that she does love Sky, but she will not see him again. Arvide, her grandfather and fellow mission worker, expresses his faith in Sky's inherent goodness and urges Sarah to follow her heart (\" More I Cannot Wish You \"). Sky arrives and tells Sarah he intends to deliver the dozen genuine sinners for the revival, but she rebukes him and walks off. Arvide subtly encourages Sky, who leaves and finds Nicely. Nicely shows Sky to the craps game, which has now moved to the sewers to hide (\"The Crapshooters' Dance\"). After playing for twenty-four hours, most of the gamblers are tired, but Big Julie, a gambler from Chicago , has lost a large sum of money and refuses to end the game until he earns it back.\n\nSky arrives and fails to convince the crapshooters to come to the mission. He gives Nathan $1,000 and claims that he lost the bet. After a comment made by one of the gamblers inspires him, Sky formulates a last-minute bet to get the sinners: if he loses, everyone gets $1,000, but if he wins, they visit to the mission one time. He wins the bet (\" Luck Be a Lady \"). On the way to the Mission, Nathan runs into Adelaide. She tries to convince him to elope, but when he tries to deflect her, Adelaide finally realizes he will never change. Nathan finally professes his love for her (\"Sue Me\"), and leaves.\n\nSarah is shocked to see that Sky carried through on his promise. The General asks the gamblers to confess their sins, and while some offer sarcastic confessions, one of them admits the real reason they are even there. The General is thrilled that good can come from evil. Attempting to appear contrite during his confession, Nicely invents a dream that encouraged him to repent, and the gamblers join in with revivalist fervor (\" Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat \"). Brannigan arrives and threatens to arrest everyone for the craps game in the Mission, but Sarah clears them, saying that none of the gamblers were at the mission the previous night. After Brannigan leaves, Nathan confesses that they held the craps game in the mission and apologizes. He also confesses to the bet he made with Sky about taking Sarah to Havana, adding that he won the bet, to Sarah's shock. She realizes that Sky wanted to protect her reputation and must genuinely care about her. Afterwards, Sarah and Adelaide run into each other, and they commiserate and then resolve to marry their men anyway and reform them later (\"Marry the Man Today\").\n\nA few weeks later, Nathan owns a newsstand and has officially closed the craps game at Adelaide's behest. Sky, who is now married to Sarah, works in the Mission band and has also stopped gambling. The characters celebrate as Nathan and Adelaide are married (\"Guys and Dolls (Finale/Reprise)\").",

Michael has taken a loan from his employer, the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, and is three months behind on payments. Wilkins, the bank's corrupt new chairman, sends associates to warn him that his house will be repossessed if the loan is not repaid in full by Friday. Michael mourns Kate and expresses concern about raising his children without her (\"A Conversation\"). Michael and his sister Jane recall that their father left them shares in the bank that should cover the loan, and they search the house for the share certificate . During the search, Michael finds his childhood kite and disposes of it.\n\nThe children visit a local park, and Georgie, who has found the kite, flies it. Mary Poppins descends from the sky with the kite in her hand. She takes the children home and announces that she will take charge of them as their nanny . She draws a bath for the three children, leading to underwater adventures (\"Can You Imagine That?\").\n\nMichael visits the bank seeking proof of his shares, but Wilkins denies that there are any records, later covertly destroying the page from the official ledger. Annabel and John decide to sell their mother's 'priceless' bowl to pay off the debt. Georgie tries to stop them, and the bowl becomes damaged while the three fight over it. Jack, a lamplighter and Bert's former apprentice, greets Mary Poppins and joins her and the children on a trip into the scene decorating the bowl. During their visit to the Royal Doulton Music Hall (\"A Cover is Not the Book\"), Georgie is kidnapped by a talking wolf, weasel, and badger who are repossessing their belongings, and Annabel and John set out to rescue him. They do so successfully, fall off the edge of the bowl, and wake in their beds. Realizing they are hurting after the loss of their mother, Mary sings them a lullaby (\" The Place Where Lost Things Go \").\n\nThe children visit Mary Poppins's cousin Topsy, hoping to get the bowl mended (\"Turning Turtle\") and learn that it has little monetary value. They take Michael's briefcase to him at the bank, where they overhear Wilkins discussing the planned repossession of their house. Believing that he and his associates are the same animal gang who kidnapped him, Georgie interrupts the meeting. Michael is angry with the children for putting the house and his job at risk. Mary Poppins takes the children home, guided by Jack and his fellow lamplighters who teach the children their rhyming slang (\"Trip A Little Light Fantastic\"). The children comfort a despairing Michael, and the four reconcile.\n\nAs midnight on Friday approaches, the Bankses prepare to move out of their house. While examining his old kite, Michael discovers that Georgie had used the missing share certificate to mend it. Jane and Michael rush to the bank while Mary Poppins and the children go with Jack and the lamplighters to Big Ben to 'turn back time'. After scaling the clock tower, they turn the clock back five minutes, giving Jane and Michael just enough time to reach the bank.\n\nWilkins, however, will not accept the certificate as part of it is still missing. Wilkins's elderly uncle and the bank's previous chairman, Mr. Dawes Jr., arrives and dismisses Wilkins on the spot for his corrupt business practices. He reveals that Michael has plenty of assets to cover the loan, namely the judiciously invested tuppence he had deposited with the bank many years earlier .\n\nThe next day, the Bankses visit the park, where a fair is in full swing. They purchase balloons that carry them into the air, where they are joined by Jack and many others (\"Nowhere to Go but Up\"). On their return home, Mary Poppins announces that it is time for her to leave. Jane and Michael thank her as her umbrella carries her back up into the sky and away.",

        "title": "Shock Treatment",
        "description": "Shock Treatment is a 1981 musical comedy film directed by Jim Sharman , and co-written by Sharman and Richard O'Brien . It is a follow-up to the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show . While not an outright sequel , Shock Treatment does feature characters from the previous film, most portrayed by different actors, as well as several Rocky Horror actors in new roles. The film stars Jessica Harper as Janet Majors and Cliff DeYoung in a dual role as her husband Brad, as well as the movie's main antagonist Farley Flavors, with O'Brien and Patricia Quinn playing sibling character actors , Cosmo and Nation McKinley, and also stars Ruby Wax , Charles Gray , and Barry Humphries . The film is an international co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe film is set in the fictional town of Denton, which has been placed under the control of a television network . The town's entire population is involved in the network's productions. Brad Majors finds himself imprisoned in the local mental hospital , while his wife Janet becomes the pet project of Farley Flavors, the local plutocrat .\n\nGiven a limited release on the midnight movie circuit beginning on October 30, 1981, Shock Treatment was a critical and commercial failure, not earning the same level of cult film status its predecessor received, but later reviews have praised its satirical themes, particularly a prescient satire of reality television. In 2015, the film was adapted as a stage production in London.",
        "synopsis": "Continuing from The Rocky Horror Picture Show are the characters of Brad and Janet Majors, now married. The film takes place in the town of Denton, U.S.A., which has been taken over by fast food magnate Farley Flavors. The film is set within a DTV (Denton Television) network television studio and opens as the studio audience is admitted into the studio. Brad and Janet, seated in the audience, are chosen to participate in the game show Marriage Maze by the kooky, supposedly blind host, Bert Schnick. While on the Marriage Maze , Brad is deemed \"an emotional cripple,\" and is forcibly sent to Dentonvale, a mental hospital located in the studio run by siblings Cosmo and Nation McKinley and the subject of the synonymously named reality show , for \"treatment.\"\n\nWhile Brad is locked away at Dentonvale, Farley Flavors, via prerecorded video, persuades Janet to pursue superstardom , suggesting that her fame will make Brad better. Although Janet participates willingly, her compliance is assured when she is drugged by the McKinleys. Janet's parents, Emily and Harry Weiss, also become enamored with fame and television, appearing first on Marriage Maze, answering questions about Brad's alleged mental instability, and later, as their \"prize\" for answering questions about Brad correctly, on Happy Homes, a reality TV show that follows people on a television set of an idealized suburban home. Rapidly, Janet and her parents forget about Brad and become obsessed with fame.\n\nIn the meantime, Betty Hapschatt and Judge Oliver Wright, cohosts of the Denton Dossier and the only people not won over by Farley Flavors' flashy television shows, investigate Flavors and the other people involved in DTV. The duo eventually discover that Cosmo and Nation McKinley are not doctors as they claim, but merely character actors , and that Farley Flavors himself is Brad's jealous, long-lost twin brother, seeking to destroy Brad and take Janet for himself. Betty Hapschatt and Judge Wright break Brad out from his prison in Dentonvale and have him confront his twin. The trio break onto the set of Farley's latest show, Faith Factory, during its debut just as Janet, who is heavily drugged, is about to be crowned \"Miss Mental Health.\" Seeing Brad helps Janet snap out of her drug-induced trance and she returns to him. Flavors imprisons Brad, Janet, Betty, and Judge Wright, then invites the remaining audience members to follow him to Dentonvale. Everyone except the four prisoners and the kids in the local band, Oscar Drill and the Bits, willingly and enthusiastically accept straitjackets and commit themselves to Dentonvale in the name of \"mental health.\" Brad, Janet, Betty, and Judge Wright escape the office they are locked into using one of Betty's hairpins to pick the lock. They join the band and successfully hotwire the car given to Miss Mental Health by a show sponsor. Band members force open the door to the studio and Brad, Janet, Betty, Judge Wright and the band drive off as a voice over reminds the viewer that \"the sun never sets on those who ride into it.\"",

        "description": "On Your Toes (1936) is a musical with a book by Richard Rodgers , George Abbott , and Lorenz Hart , music by Rodgers, and lyrics by Hart. It was adapted into a film in 1939.\n\nWhile teaching music at Knickerbocker University, Phil \"Junior\" Dolan III tries to persuade Sergei Alexandrovich, the director of the Russian Ballet, to stage the jazz ballet Slaughter on Tenth Avenue . After becoming involved with the company's prima ballerina Vera Barnova, Junior is forced to assume the male lead in Slaughter . Trouble ensues when he becomes the target of two thugs hired by Vera's lover and dance partner to kill him.\n\nOn Your Toes marked the first time a Broadway musical made dramatic use of classical dance and incorporated jazz into its score. [ citation needed ]",
        "synopsis": "On a vaudeville stage, Phil Dolan II, his wife Lili, and his son Junior perform their nightly routine, but afterwards in the dressing room, the parents tell Junior that he must go to school\u2014his mother is worried that the chorus girls taking an interest in him will corrupt him, since he has an exceptionally strong libido. Fifteen years later, as predicted, Junior is a music teacher at Knickerbocker University. He has two talented students: Sidney Cohn and Frankie Frayne. Sidney has written a promising jazz ballet which Frankie catches Junior dancing to alone in the classroom (uncovering his \"secret past\"), and she trades an introduction to the Russian Ballet's manager in return for his listening to her song.\n\nIn the apartment of Vera Baranova, star of the Russian Ballet, Peggy, the manager, enthusiastically tells Sergei, the company's director, about the new jazz ballet. He is not interested in anything new - he doesn't even recognise that the Revolution has happened! Junior arrives as Vera and co-star/unfaithful lover Konstantine Morrosine are having a Russian screaming match. The others leave, so that Vera and Junior can discuss the new ballet.  Liking what she sees, Vera pulls a very confused Junior into bed with her, and in spite of his growing love for Frankie, he succumbs to her siren seduction.\n\nBack in the classroom, Frankie is jealous of Junior's stories about Vera and the Russians (Peggy has promised him a chance to dance in the corps de ballet).  Now it's Frankie's turn to play seductress, even the score, and they find a small hotel with a wishing well. At the opening of the ballet, La Princesse Zenobia , Junior is told that one of the dancers is in jail and he must take his place, but onstage he gets all his steps, rhythms and positions cock-eyed and makes a laughing-stock of the ballet. But the audience loves it, nevertheless.\n\nSergei, Peggy, Vera, Morrosine and Junior have listened to the jazz ballet. Opinions are mixed, and Vera and Morrosine are still arguing, as he becomes increasingly jealous of Junior. Poor Junior has got love problems, too: he upsets Frankie by going to lunch with Vera (for business reasons) instead of her, but she is \" Glad to Be Unhappy \".\n\nThen Peggy, Sergei, and some of the company visit Junior's school. Sergei has come to break the bad news that he will not be doing the jazz ballet, but Peggy persuades him by threatening to pull out the million dollars she has put into the company. After Sergei's announcement that the next production will be Slaughter on Tenth Avenue , the class stages the title number \"On Your Toes\", in which the students' jazz and the company's classical routines are deftly combined.\n\nAt a rehearsal, Morrosine's jealousy of Junior escalates, he fights with Sergei and is knocked\u2013out, suddenly making Junior the new star. The humiliated Morrosine plots with his gangster friend, Louie, to shoot Junior at the end of the performance. Joe, the stage doorman, overhears and warns Frankie. On-stage, Junior is tipped\u2013off by her, and signals to the conductor to avoid the final loud climax which would cover the shot, so he keeps the orchestra playing the last few bars of the music over and over as Junior dances frantically to keep the shooter from firing until the police arrest him. After the curtain call, Frankie embraces Junior and is startled to see his parents waiting to congratulate him. Junior chooses Frankie over Vera, asks her never to leave him.  The music-teacher has made it back to his home-ground - the stage.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nJoey Richter wakes up one morning and begins talking to his best friend, his penis , Dick, about their non-existent sex life. This includes talking about Joey's crush on a particularly attractive and popular girl named Vanessa. This gets Dick excited but Joey says there isn't time for masturbation because they'll be late for school, but Dick counters by saying it will hurt if he doesn't . Joey and Dick begin masturbating, imagining an encounter with Vanessa. Suddenly, Joey's plain-looking neighbor Sally calls through Joey's window asking if he is ready for school. Due to this interruption, Joey and Dick can't finish . Dick then tries to talk Joey into \"introducing\" him to Vanessa and talks him into \"taking life by the balls,\" in order to win Vanessa's heart and get Joey to lose his virginity (\"Me and My Dick\").\n\nWhile waiting to walk to school with Joey, Sally begins talking to her vagina , Miss Cooter, who is equally upset with their sexual situation. Sally chalks it up to being \"an ugly duckling that became an ugly duck.\" Miss Cooter advises her to not be afraid to go after what she wants. Sally decides to ask Joey out, but ends up just asking him to be chemistry partners, which he agrees to. While Sally is explaining their science project, Joey and Dick plan to get Vanessa's attention but get sidetracked when they see Vanessa. Vanessa meets up with her friend Tiffany as do their vaginas, The Old Snatch (Tiffany's) and Flopsy (Vanessa's). They discuss boys, as well as monogamy , since Flopsy is tired of always having sex with Vanessa's boyfriend and the Old Snatch is used to having casual sex with almost any boy Tiffany meets. Both are ready for a break. Vanessa reveals to Tiffany that her boyfriend Rick cheated on her. Tiffany then talks Vanessa into hooking up with a loser to get back at Rick, in this case, Joey (\"Ready to Go\").\n\nSally attempts to ask out Joey again, but she is interrupted by Tiffany pairing Vanessa and Joey together for the chemistry project, which Joey eagerly accepts. Joey thanks Sally for letting him pair with Vanessa and hugs her. In the midst of the hug, Dick and Miss Cooter meet and fall in love (\"I've Seen You Around Here Before\").\n\nTiffany arrives at Vanessa's to give her a box of \"tools\" in case her study date with Joey turns into an \"epic fail,\" including handcuffs , beer , and condoms . Vanessa and Flopsy argue over whether having sex with Joey is right, but Vanessa convinces Flopsy that it is important to her. Meanwhile, Dick explains to Joey that while he and Sally hugged, Dick met Miss Cooter. Dick explains his feelings for Miss Cooter, but Joey changes Dick's mind by making him think of how great Vanessa's vagina will be.\n\nAs Sally encounters difficulties working on the science project with Tiffany, the Old Snatch tries to convince Miss Cooter to not be in love with a dick (\"Nothin' Like a Dick\"). Miss Cooter tells the Old Snatch that she is in love with Joey's dick, and the Old Snatch reveals that Joey and Vanessa are planning to have sex together. Miss Cooter refuses to believe this, insisting that Dick loves only her. Tiffany similarly breaks the news to Sally, and Sally storms off, distraught.\n\nJoey goes to Vanessa's house, and Vanessa and Joey begin drinking to try to ease the tension. Vanessa then tries several different ways to show Joey she's interested in him, but Dick tells him to play it cool, so he shrugs off her advances. However, when Vanessa flat out says she wants to have sex with him, he becomes willing. As Joey and Vanessa become physically romantic, Dick meets Flopsy but is repulsed by her and does not have the same romantic experience he had with Miss Cooter. Because of this, Joey and Dick experience erectile dysfunction , which leads Vanessa to throw them out of her house.\n\nJoey is so frustrated that he wishes he did not have a dick, and during a struggle, Dick comes off of Joey and runs away to find Miss Cooter. In shock of losing his penis, Joey is visited by his heart, who has been ignored ever since Joey and Dick became friends. Joey's heart tells Joey that everything he's been doing with Vanessa is wrong, explaining that girls want love, and not just sex (\"Listen to Your Heart\").\n\n### Act II\n\nDick becomes lost while searching for Miss Cooter, but he meets two abandoned penises, Big T and Weenie. These two are initially rough with Dick, but they decide to help him. Big T and Weenie reveal to Dick there are actually many \"lost dicks\". They bring him to the Land of the Dicks.\n\nVanessa tells Tiffany what happened with Joey. Joey arrives shortly thereafter to (with the help of his heart) win Vanessa's love. Vanessa quickly dismisses Joey's advances, and Joey runs off, crying. Tiffany lets slip what happened between Joey and Vanessa. The Old Snatch realizes that Joey was acting differently, as if he didn't have a dick. Meanwhile, Big T and Weenie realize that Dick isn't adapting well to his new home, but talk him into living as a \"free\" dick and not to be so fixated on \"getting pussy.\" Relieved to be \"off pussy time,\" Dick reveals that he left Joey, as opposed to the other dicks who had been thrown away. Big T and Weenie see this as an opportunity to find a new home: Joey.\n\nJoey and his heart are licking their wounds after their failed marriage proposal to Vanessa, but Joey's heart decides the only way to keep their dignity is for the two of them to commit suicide . Sally shows up to console Joey and Miss Cooter convinces her to confess her feelings of love to Joey. Sally does, much to Joey's shock. Sally attempts to leave but before Sally can, Joey calls after her and asks her to stay. He and his heart realize that Sally is \"the one\" for them. Sally introduces Joey and his heart to her own heart, with whom Joey's heart immediately falls in love. Joey and Sally finally come together, sharing a passionate kiss (\"Even Though\"). Sally then introduces Joey to Miss Cooter, but when it is Joey's turn to introduce Dick, Joey says that he can't be with Sally, causing Sally, Miss Cooter, and Sally's heart to leave crying. Joey's heart then convinces Joey that he has to find Dick in order to be with Sally and be happy (\"Gotta Find His Dick\").\n\nSally's heart is demanding Sally drown her sorrows in ice cream. Meanwhile, Miss Cooter tries to figure out what was wrong with Joey before being visited by the Old Snatch, who wants to take her to meet the Council of the Pussies (\"The Council of the Pussies\"). The Old Snatch asks the Council of the Pussies to help find and return Dick to Joey, stating that Dick and Miss Cooter are in love. Flopsy disputes this saying that dicks cannot love. Miss Cooter manages to convince the Council that love between genitalia does exist, and they agree to help her. The Old Snatch volunteers to lead the pussies to the Land of the Lost Dicks (\"Flight of the Pussies\").\n\nJoey is having trouble finding Dick and passes out. He is later awakened by the Lost Dicks, who at first give him hospitality, but when Joey starts asking questions about Dick, they quickly stand back to draw attention to Big T. Big T welcomes Joey to the Land of Lost Dicks and claims \"there are plenty of dicks to choose from,\" and tries to talk Joey into taking him as his dick instead of Dick. Dick arrives, and Joey tells him that he came to bring him home. Big T continues to try and convince Joey to take him, bad-mouthing Dick in the process (\"Big T's Temptation\"). Despite this, Joey chooses Dick, and tells Dick he was right about Sally and Miss Cooter all along (\"Me and My Dick (Reprise)\"). The Lost Dicks aren't happy about this, and take Dick away. Big T stands up for Dick and Joey, but Weenie sees this as Big T growing soft, and takes over as leader of the Lost Dicks. Just before Weenie can attach himself to Joey, the Council of the Pussies arrive to save him. Weenie is then picked up by a bird (the same bird who once tried to eat him after he was abandoned) and flown away. Joey and Dick are reunited, and Joey introduces Dick to his heart, stating that love and sex should be a team effort between them. The group meets up with Miss Cooter and the Old Snatch, who told Joey not to tell anyone of the world of walking, talking genitalia, which he accepts. Flopsy takes Joey, Dick, and Joey's heart home, and Dick and Miss Cooter promise to meet again. At this point, Miss Cooter prepares to leave, but the Old Snatch reveals that she isn't going back to Tiffany, as she plans to see the world. She then runs into Big T, who was her first dick. She is still mad at him for running out on her. Big T reveals that he did love her, but his master abandoned him before he could find her. (Suggesting that Tiffany was the inspiration for Big T's master to get a sex change). The two reconcile their differences and decide to travel to Venice together.\n\nMiss Cooter returns to Sally, and then she, Miss Cooter, and Sally's heart are visited by Joey, Dick, and his heart. Joey tells Sally he loves her, and the two decide to culminate their feelings by finally having sex. Meanwhile, Vanessa is envious of their new-found love, but gets back together with Rick, who says the rumors of him cheating on her were false. Flopsy and Rick's Dick are reunited, the Old Snatch and Big T are happily seeing the world together, and Weenie finds a new home as the dick of the now-vagina-less Tiffany (\"Finale\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nDiana Goodman, a suburban mother with bipolar disorder, waits for her teenage son to return home after he has broken curfew. Diana's daughter Natalie is also awake completing her homework. Her son returns home and Diana's husband Dan wakes up, and the family prepares for the day ahead until Diana, disoriented, prepares sandwiches on every surface in the kitchen, including the floor (\"Just Another Day\").\n\nNatalie, a pianist who hopes to attend the Yale School of Music , laments the stress of being an overachiever while practicing for an upcoming recital in the school music room. She runs into her classmate Henry and they bond over their shared love of music (\"Everything Else\"). Diana regularly visits her psychiatrist Dr. Fine, who prescribes a series of medications to treat her bipolar disorder that all cause unpleasant side effects. Dan, waiting in the car, mourns the current state of his life and his and Diana's relationship. When Diana says her new medication makes her feel numb and emotionless, Dr. Fine declares her stable (\"Who's Crazy?/My Psychopharmacologist and I\").\n\nHenry confesses his romantic feelings for Natalie and they start dating (\"Perfect for You\"). Diana mourns the full spectrum of emotions she once felt and flushes her medications at her son's urging (\"I Miss the Mountains\"). Henry joins the family for dinner (\"It's Gonna Be Good\"), but when Diana brings out a cake for her son's 18th birthday, Dan gently reminds her that he died as an infant and her visions of him are delusions (\"He's Not Here\"). Diana reveals to Dan that she stopped taking her medication and tells him he will never understand the pain she feels. Dan begs her to help him understand, but Diana's vision of her son reappears and she runs to him instead (\"You Don't Know\"/\"I Am the One\"). Natalie vents to Henry about Diana's attachment to her firstborn child and their strained relationship (\"Superboy and the Invisible Girl\").\n\nDiana visits a new psychiatrist, Dr. Madden, who agrees to start with talk therapy. Her son reappears and reasserts his control over Diana's life; her delusions disturb her, but she is also comforted by his presence (\"I'm Alive\").  Diana later tries hypnotherapy with Dr. Madden; she opens up about her son's death and her relationship with Natalie, admitting she had Natalie to be a replacement child and Diana was unable to hold her in the hospital. Meanwhile, Natalie messes up her piano recital after realizing her parents are not there (\"Make Up Your Mind/Catch Me I'm Falling\"). Dr. Madden encourages Diana to begin getting rid of her son's things, and she has another vision of him (\"I Dreamed a Dance\"). The vision tells Diana the only way they can be reunited is if she is dead, and she attempts suicide (\"There's a World\").\n\nDiana survives the suicide attempt, and Dr. Madden tells Dan that due to the severity of Diana's condition, electroconvulsive therapy is among the last treatment options left. Dan reminisces about their relationship and how he has stood by her through everything (\"I've Been\"), while Diana is furious at the suggestion she undergo ECT (\"Didn't I See This Movie?\") Dan convinces Diana that the treatment is a chance to get back to normal, and she reluctantly agrees (\"A Light in the Dark\").\n\n### Act II\n\nDiana undergoes ECT, while Natalie experiments with drugs and frequently goes clubbing. The two have a shared hallucination (\"Wish I Were Here\"). When Diana is released from the hospital, she reveals that she has lost her memories from the past 19 years, including her son. Dan remains optimistic that her memories will return, while Natalie is upset her mother agreed to the treatment in the first place (\"Song of Forgetting\"). Henry, worried about Natalie's substance use and self-destruction, asks her to the upcoming school dance and she declines (\"Hey #1\").\n\nDr. Madden assures Dan that Diana's memory loss from ECT is normal. Dan is hesitant to remind her about their late son, given her mental illness first manifested after the trauma of his death (\"Seconds and Years\"). The family goes through old photo albums to jog Diana's memory, leaving out any mention of their firstborn (\"Better Than Before\"). Diana's vision of her son appears and reminds her there is an important part of her life she has forgotten (\"Aftershocks\"). Henry again asks Natalie to the dance and she again declines, though he says he will come pick her up that night in case she changes her mind (\"Hey #2\").\n\nAt a follow-up visit, Diana tells Dr. Madden she knows there is something important from her past she still can't remember. Dr. Madden, unaware that Dan has been keeping it from her, accidentally reveals the existence of her dead son (\"You Don't Know (Reprise)\"). Diana returns home and finds her son's music box, and Dan reluctantly reminds her of the circumstances of his death at 8 months old from an intestinal blockage, which all the doctors had missed (\"How Could I Ever Forget?\") but the confused Diana says she remembers him as a teenager due to having hallucinated him. The couple argue over Dan's insistence that she undergo more ECT and his refusal to tell her their son's name (\"It's Gonna Be Good (Reprise)\").\n\nDiana asks Dan why he stays with her despite everything her illness has put him through. He reminds her of the vows he took when they married and promises he is committed to her no matter what. Henry, waiting to take Natalie to the dance, pledges the same to her (\"Why Stay?/A Promise\") and she agrees to go with him. The vision of Diana's son reappears (\"I'm Alive (Reprise)\") and threatens Diana, telling her the doctors lied to her.\n\nDiana visits Dr. Madden, frustrated that years of treatments haven't helped her and wondering if her grief over her son's death can even be treated (\"The Break\"). Dr. Madden unsuccessfully pleads with her to continue treatment (\"Make Up Your Mind/Catch Me I'm Falling (Reprise)\") but she leaves. Diana and Natalie have a heart-to-heart, noting their similarities (\"Maybe (Next to Normal)\") Diana drives Natalie to the dance, where she frets to Henry that she will struggle with her mental health the same way as her mother. Henry promises he will stand by her regardless of what happens in the future (\"Hey #3/Perfect for You (Reprise)\").\n\nDiana returns home and tells Dan though she loves him, she is leaving, as they each need to grieve their son on their own (\"So Anyway\"). After she leaves, a devastated Dan finally acknowledges the vision of his late son, and they embrace. For the first and only time in the show, Dan and Diana's son is called by his name: Gabe (\"I Am the One (Reprise)\").\n\nNatalie returns home from the dance to find her mother gone and her father sitting in the dark. She turns on a lamp, telling Dan, \"We need some light.\" Natalie continues her relationship with Henry, while Diana temporarily moves in with her parents. Dr. Madden recommends another psychiatrist to Dan, so he can begin his own journey of grieving Gabe's death. The cast, including Gabe, acknowledge the difficulty of moving forward but hopeful that they will adjust to the changes in their lives (\"Light\").",

It was generally well received by critics, and Garfield received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance.",
        "synopsis": "Jon is an aspiring composer for musical theater , who lives in SoHo , New York.  The year is 1990, and as his 30th birthday approaches Jon is worried about his aging and lack of achievement (\"30/90\").  Michael, a friend of Jon's since childhood, gave up acting to pursue a more lucrative career in marketing . Susan, Jon's girlfriend, is a dancer who teaches ballet to \"wealthy and untalented children\". On the roof of his apartment building, Jon reveals that he is nervous about an upcoming workshop of his newest musical, SUPERBIA . When Susan comes to join him, he comments on her dress and how beautiful it makes her look (\"Green Green Dress\").\n\nThe next morning, Susan asks Jon about the possibility of leaving New York.  Jon is torn between following his dream of composing and opting for security and family in a different career (\"Johnny Can\u2019t Decide\"). His reverie is cut short when he remembers his day job as a waiter in a SoHo diner (\"Sunday\").\n\nAfter work, Michael picks Jon up in his brand new BMW to show Jon his new apartment. Michael exults at the thought of a life of luxury (\"No More\"), and pressures Jon further to consider changing his career path. He agrees to accompany Michael to work the next day and visit a brainstorming session at his firm. Back at home, Jon plans to spend the remainder of the evening composing, but is interrupted by a call from Susan (\"Therapy\").\n\nAt Michael's office, the brainstorming session involves naming a cooking fat substitute through a convoluted process.  Jon sees the futility of the process and his unwillingness to cooperate gets him removed from the meeting. As Jon drives Michael to the airport for a business trip, they argue about the meeting. Michael tells Jon that the life Susan wants doesn't sound bad, and that he wishes his job could give him the chance to settle down (\"Real Life\").\n\nAfter dropping Michael off, Jon goes to a rehearsal for SUPERBIA, but not before stopping to get a snack of Twinkies (\"Sugar\"). At the market, he spies Karessa Johnson, one of his actors for SUPERBIA. She reveals a similar weakness for Twinkies, and this leads to a sudden friendship between the two. After the rehearsal, Susan sees Jon and Karessa walking together and becomes jealous. Jon begs Susan to stay and be with him. Despite this, she leaves for home, and Jon thinks about what may have happened to make her behave this way (\"See Her Smile\").\n\nThe next morning, Jon arrives early at the theater for the workshop of SUPERBIA. Karessa steals the show with her performance of \"Come to Your Senses\". Jon gets many congratulations, but no offers to produce the show, and so, in his eyes, the workshop has been a failure. Jon visits Michael and tells him that he is through with music. Michael says that while he enjoys how he makes a lot more money now, he finds the job to be banal and unrewarding. The two argue, and Jon yells at Michael for not understanding fear or insecurity. Michael responds by telling Jon that he is HIV-positive. Shocked, Jon leaves quickly and wanders through Central Park until he finds himself at the closed Delacorte Theater . He finds an old rehearsal piano and begins to play it while collecting his thoughts. Jon ponders on whether the amount of sacrifice required for his career in music is worth it, and whether those telling him to \"have it all, play the game\" are right (\"Why\"). Ultimately, he realizes that he will only be happy as a professional composer, no matter what hardships that may bring.\n\nThe next morning is Jon's thirtieth birthday party (\"30/90 (Reprise)\"). He sees Susan, who is getting ready to leave. She gives him his birthday gift: a thousand sheets of blank manuscript paper. They agree to write to each other, and she leaves. The phone rings, and the caller is Jon's idol, Stephen Sondheim . Sondheim leaves Jon his contact information so they can meet and discuss SUPERBIA . Jon realizes that he is surrounded by friends and that his talents are finally being recognized (\"Louder than Words\").",

        "description": "Pinocchio is a 1940 American animated musical fantasy film loosely based on Carlo Collodi 's 1883 novel The Adventures of Pinocchio , produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures . The production was supervised by Ben Sharpsteen and Hamilton Luske , and the film's sequences were directed by Bill Roberts, Norman Ferguson , Jack Kinney , Wilfred Jackson and T. Hee .\n\nWith the voices of Cliff Edwards , Dickie Jones , Christian Rub , Walter Catlett , Charles Judels , Evelyn Venable , Frankie Darro , Mel Blanc and Clarence Nash , the film follows a wooden puppet, Pinocchio , who is created by an old woodcarver , Geppetto , and brought to life by a blue fairy . Wishing to become a real boy, Pinocchio must prove himself to be \"brave, truthful, and unselfish.\" Along his journey, Pinocchio encounters several characters representing the temptations and consequences of wrongdoing, as a cricket named Jiminy , who takes the role of Pinocchio's conscience, attempts to guide him in matters of right and wrong.\n\nPinocchio was a groundbreaking achievement in the area of effects animation, giving realistic movement to vehicles and machinery as well as natural elements such as rain, water, lightning, smoke, and shadow. After premiering at the Center Theatre in New York City on February 7, 1940, Pinocchio was released in theatres on February 23, 1940.\n\nAlthough it received critical acclaim and became the first animated feature to win a competitive Academy Award \u2014 winning two for Best Music, Original Score and for Best Music, Original Song for \" When You Wish Upon a Star \" (the latter that would later serve as the Walt Disney Company 's signature song ) \u2014 it was initially a commercial failure , mainly due to World War II cutting off the European and Asian markets. It eventually made a profit after its 1945 rerelease, and is considered one of the greatest animated films ever made , with a 100% rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes . The film and characters are still prevalent in popular culture, featuring at various Disney parks and other forms of entertainment. In 1994, Pinocchio was added to the United States National Film Registry for being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nIn 2000, a live-action musical television film titled Geppetto was released with some elements from the 1940 film. A live-action remake of the same title directed by Robert Zemeckis was released in 2022 on Disney+ .",
        "synopsis": "In a sleepy village in Italy , Jiminy Cricket arrives at the shop of a woodworker and toymaker named Geppetto , who creates a puppet he names Pinocchio . As he falls asleep, Geppetto wishes upon a star for Pinocchio to be a real boy. Late that night, the Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself to be brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy. When Jiminy reveals himself, the Blue Fairy assigns him to be Pinocchio's conscience. Geppetto awakens upon hearing the commotion from Pinocchio falling, and is overjoyed to discover that he is alive and will become a real boy.\n\nThe next morning, while walking to school, Pinocchio is led astray by con artist fox Honest John and his sidekick Gideon the Cat . Honest John convinces him to join Stromboli 's puppet show, despite Jiminy's protestations. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction, but when he tries to go home, Stromboli locks him in a bird cage and leaves to tour the world with Pinocchio. After Jiminy unsuccessfully tries to free his friend, the Blue Fairy appears, and an anxious Pinocchio lies about what happened, causing his nose to grow and become a tree branch with a bird's nest. The Blue Fairy restores his nose and frees Pinocchio when he promises to make amends, but warns him that she can offer no further help.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious Coachman hires Honest John to find disobedient and naughty boys for him to take to Pleasure Island , a notorious and infamous place. Honest John, despite the legal risks and the Coachman's implication of what happens to the boys, accepts the job out of fear, and finds Pinocchio, persuading him to take a vacation on Pleasure Island. On the way to the island, Pinocchio befriends Lampwick , a delinquent boy. At Pleasure Island, without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio, Lampwick, and many other boys soon engage in vices such as vandalism, fighting, smoking and drinking. Jiminy eventually finds Pinocchio in a bar smoking and playing pool with Lampwick, and the two have a falling out after Pinocchio defends Lampwick for his actions. As Jiminy tries leaving Pleasure Island, he discovers that the island hides a horrible curse that transforms the boys into donkeys after making \"jackasses\" of themselves, and they are sold by the Coachman into slave labor. Pinocchio witnesses Lampwick transform into a donkey, and with Jiminy's help, he flees before he can be fully transformed himself, though he still has a donkey's ears and tail.\n\nUpon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find Geppetto's workshop deserted, and obtain a letter from the Blue Fairy in the form of a dove, stating that Geppetto had set out to sea in search for Pinocchio on Pleasure Island, but got swallowed by a gigantic and vicious sperm whale called Monstro and is now trapped in its belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the Mediterranean Sea with Jiminy and is soon swallowed by Monstro, where he reunites with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze and allow them to escape, but the whale chases them and destroys their raft with his tail. Pinocchio selflessly pulls Geppetto to safety in a cove just as Monstro crashes into it and Pinocchio is killed.\n\nBack at home, Geppetto, Jiminy, Figaro, and Cleo mourn Pinocchio. Having succeeded in proving himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, Pinocchio is revived and turned into a real human boy by the Blue Fairy, much to everyone's joy. As the group celebrates, Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.",

The original 1962 Broadway production featured Sid Caesar in multiple roles with multiple stage accents, playing all of the heroine's husbands and lovers. One of the better-known songs from the musical is \" I've Got Your Number \".",
        "synopsis": "Note: This summary is based on the original Broadway production. The libretto was revised heavily for both of the subsequent revivals, with songs cut, added, or moved (most notably \"Little Me\").\n\nBelle Poitrine (n\u00e9e Schlumpfert) writes her autobiography with the help of Patrick Dennis (\"The Truth\"). As a child from Venezuela, Illinois, she lived in Drifter's Row, the poor side of town and dreamed of living on The Bluff, the rich part of town (\"The Other Side of the Tracks\"). Then she meets Noble Eggleston, from the \"right\" side of the tracks, and they feel an instant connection due to the presence of their \"I Love You Theme\" that plays whenever they touch. He invites her to his Sweet Sixteen party, and she agrees to go. At the party, Noble's friends all try to out-snob each other (\"The Rich Kid Rag\"). Noble's mother discovers that Belle lives in Drifter's Row and demands that Belle be sent away. Belle and Noble profess their love (\"I Love You\"), and Belle agrees to find wealth, culture, and social position to become equal to Noble so they can be together. She begins her journey, ignoring her friend George, who tells her it will only lead to her \"getting kicked in the heart\" (\"The Other Side of the Tracks (Reprise)\").\n\nHer first conquest is old, rich banker Mr. Pinchley, who is the \"meanest, nastiest, and stingiest man in town\" who refuses to help the poor. After Belle gets him to look at himself, Mr. Pinchley decides he no longer wants to be hated. Belle agrees to help him, and he wins the love of his son, and the citizens of Drifter's Row due to his generosity (\"Deep Down Inside\"). He shows her a gun, telling her that he was going to kill himself for his birthday, and that now, because of her, he won't. He asks Belle to marry him, and, as it will award her with wealth, culture, and social position, she accepts. When she gives him a hug, the gun accidentally goes off, killing him. Arrested and put on trial for murder, she meets theatrical producers Benny and Bernie Buchsbaum and they advise her to become a star (\"Be a Performer\"). With Noble (who is now attending Harvard and Yale) helping her, she is acquitted and becomes a famous vaudeville performer with her own signature number (\"Dimples\") and no talent.\n\nBenny and Bernie fire her when they get a new star, and she is forced to become a camera girl at a club. There, she discovers Noble's mother is forcing him to marry Ramona, his wealthy friend. Devastated, she runs off. Then, the grand Val du Val makes his entrance and performs his sexually implicit song (\"Boom-Boom\") with his \"Val du Val-ettes\". Deciding she has nothing left to live for, she prepares to jump off the roof. Val du Val notices this and prevents her from jumping, and leaves her in the hands of the club's owner. The owner is revealed to be George, who charms her (\"I've Got Your Number\") and gets her pregnant.\n\nAt a party during World War I, she meets and marries near-sighted soldier Fred Poitrine, who mistakes her pregnant condition for excess weight (\"Real Live Girl\"). Fred is shipped off to France immediately after they marry, and soon dies in action from a serious digit wound after his finger gets caught in a typewriter. Belle has her baby and discovers that Noble is in trouble in France. She leaves the baby to her mother, quickly travels to France and, after failing to find Noble, stays to cheer up the troops with the help of some willing girls (\"Real Live Girl (Reprise)\"). She then finds Val du Val has been left by his lover and now has amnesia . Belle uses the \"booms\" of the cannons to help him remember (\"Boom-Boom (Reprise)\"). His memory returns and they decide to marry. However, Noble has also arrived and Belle decides to marry him instead. When Val returns, she informs him of this, but he believes she \"jilted\" him like his old girlfriend and loses his memory again. Remembering how Val saved her life, she marries Val and tells Noble she no longer loves him (\"Finale Act I: Boom-Boom\").\n\nFive years later, Belle and Val sail on the SS Gigantic . She runs into Noble again, and, with the help of their \"I Love You Theme\", they reveal they still love each other. The boat hits an iceberg and Noble helps save the passengers while they reaffirm their love (\"I Love (Sinking) You (Reprise)\"). Discovering Belle loves Noble, Val du Val believes he has been \"jilted\" and loses his memory. He dies when he forgets how to swim, the only casualty of the sinking. This allows Belle to sue the boat company for the loss of her husband and luggage, and she successfully attains the wealth she had been seeking.\n\nBernie and Benny ask her to fund their next movie with her enormous fortune, and she accepts both the charity and the lead role (\"Poor Little Hollywood Star\"). While looking for a producer, she meets the director Otto Schnitzler (\"Be a Performer (Reprise)\"). As they shoot the movie, Otto shows an actor what to do with a stage knife but actually stabs himself. Belle finishes the movie herself, which is a huge critical failure. However, she receives a huge award for her role in the movie, meaning she has attained culture.\n\nDuring The Great Depression , Ramona's family has lost all of their money, and Miss Eggleston forces her and Noble to divorce, leaving him free for Belle. Belle, meanwhile, is still in search of social position and determines to seek it in Europe (\"Little Me\").\n\nBelle next journeys to Monte Carlo and meets Prince Cherney, the leader of a small, impoverished nation. He has a heart attack when he gambles his country's entire treasury and loses. He needs his hypodermic needle, but Belle gives him his fountain pen, leading him close to death. He and his many mourners make a huge deal out of it (\"Goodbye (The Prince's Farewell)\"), but Belle gives him part of her giant fortune to save his country. In his relief, he is restored to health, and in gratitude he makes her \"Countess Zoftig\" - she has attained social position. She then reveals that she had given him poisoned wine so he wouldn't suffer. The Prince suddenly dies, but Belle now has wealth, culture, and social position and can return to Noble.\n\nNoble, now governor of both North Dakota and South Dakota, agrees to marry Belle, and, in celebration, she suggests that he take a toast of champagne despite being a lifelong teetotaler. This causes him to become alcoholic, and he is impeached . Ashamed, he leaves Belle. Devastated, she returns to Baby and marries George, where they now live in The Bluff (\"Here's to Us\"). As Belle hosts a party (\"Here's to Us\"), George encounters Noble, now a drunken bum, outside their home. He encourages him to return to Belle, but Noble instead flees to find a way to regain himself.\n\nAfter Belle finishes her story for the autobiography, Baby announces she and Noble Junior (whom Noble had while with Ramona) are getting married. Patrick Dennis announces he is done with his research, but right then Miss Eggleston bursts in with a gun, intent on killing Belle for ruining her life and her son. She and Belle struggle with the gun, and it goes off just as Noble, newly sober, steps into the room. At first it appears Noble was shot, but then it is revealed that she shot George, who dies. Their \"I Love You Theme\" playing, Belle decides to marry Noble even though he no longer has wealth, culture, and social position and they all live happily ever after (\"Finale Act II\").\n\nNote: As scripted, the same actor portrays Noble, Pinchley, Val, Fred, Schnitzler, Prince Cherney and Noble Junior.",

Based on the comic strip Little Nemo in Slumberland by Winsor McCay , the film went through a lengthy development process with a number of screenwriters. Ultimately, the screenplay was credited to Chris Columbus and Richard Outten ; the storyline and art style differed from the original version. The original soundtrack was penned by the Academy Award -winning Sherman Brothers . The film features the English dub voices of Gabriel Damon , Mickey Rooney , Ren\u00e9 Auberjonois , Danny Mann, and Bernard Erhard .\n\nEven though it derived from an American comic strip, Little Nemo was animated by the Japanese company Tokyo Movie Shinsha and thus is often considered an anime film, although it was a joint production of Japanese and American animators and production companies.\n\nThe movie was infamous for being in development hell for much of the 1980s, with many people involved with the production at some point before dropping out. Some of those attached to the film worked at Disney , Lucasfilm , Warner Bros. Cartoons , and Studio Ghibli . Those who expressed interest or were involved at some stage included George Lucas , Chuck Jones , Ray Bradbury , Isao Takahata , Brad Bird , Jerry Rees , Chris Columbus, Ken Anderson , Frank Thomas , Oliver Johnston , Paul Julian , Osamu Dezaki , the Sherman Brothers ( Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman ), Hayao Miyazaki (who was working at TMS at the time), and Gary Kurtz .\n\nThe film was first released in Japan on July 15, 1989, by the Toho-Towa and in the United States on August 21, 1992, by the Hemdale Film Corporation for the dub. It received mixed reviews and was a box-office bomb , earning $11.4 million on a $35 million budget. However, it sold well on home video and has since become a cult film .",
        "synopsis": "A young boy named Nemo experiences a nightmare in which he is pursued by a locomotive . Upon awakening the next day, he goes with his pet flying squirrel , Icarus to see a parade welcoming a traveling circus . However, Nemo is unable to see the circus since his parents are too busy to take him.\n\nThat night, Nemo imitates sleepwalking in an attempt to sneak some pie away, which acts against a promise he had made earlier to his mother, who catches him in the act and makes him run back to his room empty-handed.\n\nUpon falling asleep, Nemo is approached by figures from the circus parade. The circus organist introduces himself as Professor Genius and claims that they had been sent on a mission by King Morpheus, the king of a realm named Slumberland. The mission involves Nemo becoming the playmate of the princess, Camille. Although Nemo initially has reservations about interacting with a girl, he and Icarus decide to set off to fulfill his mission after being persuaded with a gift box of cookies from the princess.\n\nNemo is taken to Slumberland in a dirigible which he is allowed to drive, causing some chaos, and is introduced to King Morpheus. Morpheus reveals that he summoned Nemo to become his heir to the throne. Morpheus gives Nemo a golden key that opens every door in the kingdom and warns him of a door with a dragon insignia that must never be opened. Nemo is introduced to Princess Camille and the pair roam the entirety of Slumberland together.\n\nAfterward, Nemo meets the mischievous clown Flip who convinces him to ditch his prince lessons, and later angers a group of cops, forcing him and Nemo to hide out in a cave. There, Nemo discovers the door that Morpheus warned him not to open. Flip tempts Nemo into unlocking the door, which unleashes \"the nightmare\". Nemo rushes back to Morpheus' castle in time for his coronation ceremony where he is handed the royal scepter, the only thing capable of defeating the Nightmare King, the ruler of Nightmare Land, should he ever return to Slumberland. In the middle of a dance session between Morpheus and Genius, \"The Nightmare\" reaches the castle and steals Morpheus away. As the partygoers search for a scapegoat, Flip and Nemo accuse each other, though the responsibility goes to Nemo who had the key.\n\nNemo awakens in his home, which floods with seawater and ejects him and Icarus into the ocean. Genius discovers them and tells Nemo not to blame himself for Morpheus's capture and that Flip is at fault for tempting him, but Nemo accepts his role in the situation, and pledges to find the King. When the three return to Slumberland, they rescue Flip from being shot out of a cannon into outer space because he withheld information on owning a map of Nightmare Land where Morpheus is currently being held.\n\nNemo, Icarus, Camille, Flip, and Genius set off in a tugboat in search of Morpheus. They are soon sucked into a whirlpool and find themselves in the goblin -infested Nightmare Land. The five come across a group of shapeshifting goblins called Boomps consisting of Oompa, Oomp, Oompe, and Oompy. They wish to aid in the quest to rescue Morpheus. The Nightmare King sends a flock of gigantic bats to seize the rescue party. Nemo attempts to use the scepter, but cannot remember the full incantation, and awakens in his bed along with Icarus again after watching Camille, Flip, and Genius get captured.\n\nThe Boomps appear in Nemo's room after he awakes. After reuniting with a lost member of theirs named Oompo who gives Nemo a letter from Morpheus containing the full scepter incantation, the group travels to Nightmare Castle by flying through a portal in the sky. However, they are subsequently trapped in the castle where the Nightmare King demands possession of the scepter, threatening his captives, including Morpheus, to try and force Nemo's compliance. After a fierce battle, Nemo uses the scepter to finally destroy the Nightmare King and purify Nightmare Land, but seemingly at the cost of his own life as well.\n\nAs everyone mourns Nemo's death, Morpheus uses the scepter to revive him, and accepts his apology for causing everything, assuring Nemo that his courage has allowed him to make up for his mistake and become a true prince. As Slumberland celebrates the fall of the Nightmare Kingdom, Camille escorts Nemo and Icarus home on the dirigible. She and Nemo then share a kiss.\n\nNemo awakens in his room, where he apologizes to his mother for breaking his promise and trying to take the pie. Nemo's parents also agree to take Nemo to the circus. Nemo stares out the window with Icarus as he looks forward to his new day.",

        "description": "The Phantom of the Opera is a musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber , lyrics by Charles Hart , additional lyrics by Richard Stilgoe , and a libretto by Lloyd Webber and Stilgoe. Based on the 1910 novel by Gaston Leroux , it tells the tragic story of beautiful soprano Christine Daa\u00e9 , who becomes the obsession of a mysterious and disfigured musical genius living in the subterranean labyrinth beneath the Paris Opera House .\n\nThe musical opened in London's West End in 1986 and on Broadway in New York in 1988, in a production directed by Harold Prince and starring English classical soprano Sarah Brightman (Lloyd Webber's then-wife) as Christine Daa\u00e9, screen and stage star Michael Crawford as the Phantom, and international stage performer Steve Barton as Raoul. It won the 1986 Olivier Award and the 1988 Tony Award for Best Musical, with Crawford winning the Olivier and Tony for Best Actor in a Musical. A film adaptation , directed by Joel Schumacher , was released in 2004.\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera is the longest running show in Broadway history , and celebrated its 10,000th performance on 11 February 2012, becoming the first Broadway production in history to do so. It is the second longest-running West End musical , after Les Mis\u00e9rables , and the third longest-running West End show overall, after The Mousetrap . With total estimated worldwide gross receipts of over $ 6 billion and total Broadway gross of over $1 billion, The Phantom of the Opera was the most financially successful entertainment event until The Lion King surpassed it in 2014. By 2019, it had been seen by over 140 million people in 183 cities across 41 countries.\n\nThe original West End production at His Majesty's Theatre , London, ended its run in March 2020 due to the shutdown of theatres resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic . A scaled-down, revised staging opened in the same theatre in July 2021, with a \"smaller orchestra and redesigned set\". The original Broadway production played its final performance on 16 April 2023.",
        "synopsis": "### Prologue\n\nIn 1919, the Paris Op\u00e9ra House hosts an auction of theatre memorabilia. Among the attendees is Raoul de Chagny , who purchases Lot 665, a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 music box with a monkey figurine. He cryptically observes that it appears \"exactly as she said\". The next lot \u2013 Lot 666 \u2013  is a broken chandelier, portions of which have been renovated with electrical wiring. The auctioneer states that this chandelier was involved in a famous disaster, connected to \"the strange affair of the Phantom of the Opera , a mystery never fully explained\". He commands the auction assistants to turn on the chandelier. As the overture plays, the chandelier flickers to life and ascends to the ceiling, a transition back in time restoring the opera house to its former grandeur (\"Overture\").\n\n### Act I\n\nIn 1881, the cast of a new production, Hannibal , is rehearsing (\"Hannibal Rehearsal\"). Carlotta, the Op\u00e9ra's resident soprano prima donna , begins performing an aria when a backdrop falls from the flies, causing anxious chorus girls to shout, \"He's here! The Phantom of the Opera!\" The new owners, Firmin and Andr\u00e9, downplay the incident, but Carlotta storms offstage. Madame Giry , the Op\u00e9ra's ballet mistress , suggests that Christine Daa\u00e9 , a chorus girl and orphaned daughter of a prominent Swedish violinist, has been \"well taught\" and can sing Carlotta's role. As their only alternative is cancelling the show, the managers audition her, and discover that she is indeed talented. As Christine sings the aria during the evening performance, the Op\u00e9ra's new patron, Raoul, Vicomte de Chagny, recognizes her as his childhood friend and playmate (\"Think of Me\").\n\nBackstage after her triumphant debut, Christine confesses to her friend, Madame Giry's daughter Meg , that her singing has been inspired by an unseen tutor she knows only as the \"Angel of Music\" (\"Angel of Music\").  Raoul visits Christine in her dressing room and the two reminisce about \"Angel of Music\" stories that her father used to tell them. Christine confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing (\"Little Lotte\"). Raoul indulges what he assumes are fantasies and insists on taking Christine to dinner. When Raoul leaves to fetch his hat, Christine hears the Phantom's voice and entreats him to reveal himself. The Phantom appears in her mirror (\"The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)\"). Christine is hypnotized and drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who leads her into the shadowy sewers below the Op\u00e9ra house. The two board a small boat and cross a subterranean lake to his lair (\" The Phantom of the Opera \"). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his musical compositions. A mirror reflects an image of her in a wedding dress; when the mirror image spreads its arms towards the real Christine, she faints . The Phantom lays her on a bed and covers her with his cloak (\" The Music of the Night \").\n\nAs the Phantom composes music at his organ, Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box (\"I Remember\"). She slips behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his disfigured face. The Phantom rails at her prying, then ruefully expresses his longing to be loved (\"Stranger Than You Dreamt It\"). Moved by pity, Christine returns the mask to the Phantom, and he escorts her back above ground.\n\nJoseph Buquet , the Op\u00e9ra's chief stagehand, regales the ballet girls with tales of the \"Op\u00e9ra Ghost\" and his terrible Punjab lasso. Madame Giry warns Buquet to restrain himself (\"Magical Lasso\"). Arguments break out in the managers' office between Firmin, Andr\u00e9, Raoul, and Carlotta over notes sent by the Phantom, including a demand that Christine replace Carlotta in the starring role of the new opera, Il Muto (\"Notes\").  Firmin and Andr\u00e9 assure Carlotta that she will remain the star (\"Prima Donna\").\n\nThe premi\u00e8re of Il Muto goes well until the Phantom enchants Carlotta's voice, reducing it to a frog-like croak. Firmin rushes to defuse the situation by announcing to the audience that Christine will take over the starring role; he instructs the conductor to bring the ballet forward to keep the audience entertained. Buquet's corpse drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Mayhem erupts and the Phantom's sinister laugh is heard throughout the auditorium (\"Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh\").\n\nChristine escapes with Raoul to the rooftop and tells him about her encounter with the Phantom (\"Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There\"). Raoul promises to love and protect her (\" All I Ask of You \"). The Phantom, who overheard their conversation, is heartbroken and swears revenge. In the auditorium, the chandelier crashes onto the stage during the Il Muto curtain call (\"All I Ask of You (Reprise)\").\n\n### Act II\n\nSix months later, the Opera house hosts a masquerade ball . The Phantom, who has been absent since the chandelier disaster, appears in costume as the Red Death . He announces that he has written an opera entitled Don Juan Triumphant , and demands that it be produced with Christine, who is now secretly engaged to Raoul, in the lead role. He pulls Christine's engagement ring from the chain around her neck before vanishing in a flash of light (\"Masquerade/Why So Silent\").\n\nRaoul accosts Madame Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. She explains that the Phantom is a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer, who was born with a deformed face. Feared and reviled by society, he was exhibited in a cage as part of a travelling fair until he escaped and took refuge beneath the opera house.\n\nRaoul plots to use the premi\u00e8re of Don Juan Triumphant to trap the Phantom, knowing he will attend the debut. He begs Christine to help lure the Phantom into the trap (\"Notes/Twisted Every Way\"). During rehearsals, Piangi, the house tenor, sings his role incorrectly, causing chaos. The piano suddenly plays by itself, with the entire cast singing in harmony. Torn between her love for Raoul and her loyalty to the Phantom, Christine visits her father's grave, begging for his guidance (\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\"). The Phantom appears atop the mausoleum (\"Wandering Child\"). Christine begins succumbing to the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to rescue her. The Phantom taunts Raoul, hurling fireballs at him until Christine begs Raoul to leave with her. Furious, the Phantom declares war upon them.\n\nDon Juan Triumphant premieres with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles of Aminta and Don Juan. During Don Juan and Aminta's duet, Christine realises that the Phantom has replaced Piangi (\"Don Juan Triumphant/The Point of No Return\"). She calmly removes his mask, revealing his deformed face to the horrified audience. Exposed, the Phantom drags Christine off the stage and back to his lair. Piangi's garrotted body is revealed backstage and the opera house plunges into chaos. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for the murders of Buquet and Piangi, searches for the Phantom. Madame Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's subterranean lair and warns him to keep his hand at the level of his eyes to avoid the magical lasso (\"Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer\").\n\nThe Phantom forces Christine to don a wedding dress. Raoul comes to the rescue but is ensnared in the Punjab lasso. The Phantom offers Christine an ultimatum: if she will stay with him, he will spare Raoul, but if she refuses, Raoul will die (\"The Point of No Return Reprise\"). Christine tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him.\n\nHaving experienced kindness and compassion for the first time, the Phantom frees Raoul. He tells Christine that he loves her before she exits the lair with Raoul. As the mob closes in, the Phantom huddles on his throne beneath his cloak. Meg is the first to enter the lair. She approaches the Phantom's throne and pulls away the cloak, finding only his mask (\"Finale\").",

In the infirmary, Ron cries over Hermione's petrified body and determines to find a way to save everyone, realising he doesn't care about being second-best (\"I'm Just A Sidekick\"). Ron discovers a note Hermione wrote; Draco and Ron drink Felix Felicis and Draco sets out to find the Chamber of Secrets, while Ron searches for Harry.\n\nRon runs into Lockhart, who gloats about how he has turned Harry's story into seven books and merchandise in order to extort money from muggles. He also revealed he purposefully drove Harry away and slandered him in the election, he attempts to obliviate Ron, but is chased by the Wizard Cops who had been working with Hagrid all year. Ron learns that Kingsley Shacklebolt intends to blow up Hogwarts to kill the monster, but Hagrid secretly frees Ron who steals the flying car.\n\nHarry is horrified to find Godric's Hollow has destroyed his statue to replace with one of Andrew Garfield's Spiderman, but the construction worker gives him advice. The worker repeats what Dumbledore said earlier, revealing to have Dumbledore's beard underneath his own before vanishing mysteriously. Ron arrives and attempts to convince him to return, but Harry refuses and causes a distraught Ron to storm off.\n\nHarry finds the Resurrection Stone inside his lucky Snitch , and the ghosts of his deceased family and friends appear to give him encouragement (\"Everything Ends\"). Ron returns after talking to the construction worker and they return to Hogwarts. The students stand up to the Ministry and with Ron, Harry, the Sorting Hat 'Sorty', and the Scarf of Sexual Preference 'Scarfy', set out to slay the Basilisk (\"Goin' Back To Hogwarts\" reprise).\n\nInside the Chamber, Harry and the students are overpowered by the Basilisk. Scarfy sacrifices himself to temporarily blind the Basilisk and allow them to escape. Harry succeeds in pulling the sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat and slays the Basilisk, but is bitten in the process (\"Harry Freakin' Potter\" reprise). As Voldemort stands over a dying Harry, Harry stabs the diary with the sword, killing the fragment of Voldemort's soul and saving Ginny. Hagrid arrives with Fawkes, whose healing tears rescue Harry from near-death.\n\nThe petrified students recover from their frozen state following the Basilisk's death, except for Colin Creevey, who dies. Hermione joins the rest of the students in the Chamber. Ron pulls an engagement ring from the Scarf of Sexual Preference and proposes to Hermione, who accepts, having heard his song in the infirmary. Harry finally accepts Draco as his friend. Harry proposes to Ginny, who accepts, and the students rejoice (\"Days of Summer\" reprise). As Harry is taking in all the times he had at Hogwarts, Ron arrives to pick him up for the last time. Harry says goodbye to Hogwarts and leaves with Ron.\n\n19 years later, Harry takes his son - Albus Scarfy Potter - to platform 9\u00be (\"Goin' Back to Hogwarts\" reprise), where he runs into Quirrell, but fails to recognize him. Voldemort and Quirrell are at King's Cross to see their daughter leave for Hogwarts. Voldemort has come to terms with his defeat, and says that Harry has taught him how to love and that it is okay to let go of things, even if it hurts.",

        "title": "School of Rock (musical)",
        "description": "School of Rock is a rock musical with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber , lyrics by Glenn Slater and a book by Julian Fellowes . Based on the 2003 film of the same name , written by Mike White , the musical follows Dewey Finn, an out-of-work rock singer and guitarist who pretends to be a substitute teacher at a prestigious prep school. After identifying the musical talent in his students, Dewey forms a band of fifth-graders, in an attempt to win the upcoming Battle of the Bands contest.\n\nThe musical made its Broadway debut and world premiere on December 6, 2015, at the Winter Garden Theatre , following previews from November 9, 2015, directed by Laurence Connor and starring Alex Brightman as Dewey Finn and Sierra Boggess as Rosalie Mullins. The musical made its West End debut at the Gillian Lynne Theatre on November 14, 2016.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe musical begins with a performance by the band No Vacancy . The band's guitarist, Dewey Finn, repeatedly attempts to upstage the lead singer (\"I'm Too Hot for You\u201d) which leads to the band agreeing to kick him out for his antics after Dewey leaves the stage. The next morning, Dewey is awoken in his bedroom by his longtime friend, Ned Schneebly, and Ned's domineering girlfriend, Patty Di Marco. Patty demands rent from Dewey while Ned cowers behind her. After they leave, Dewey goes about his day, getting kicked out of his band and fired from his job at a record store, all while dreaming about getting his break and becoming a superstar (\"When I Climb to the Top of Mount Rock\"). Afterwards, Dewey receives a call from Rosalie Mullins, principal of the prestigious Horace Green School. She asks to speak to Ned, saying that the school has an open substitute teacher position that will pay over nine hundred dollars a week\u2014enough to meet the rent. Pretending to be Ned, Dewey accepts the position.\n\nAt Horace Green, Rosalie does her best to keep everything running smoothly while greeting parents who come to drop off their children (\"Horace Green Alma Mater\"). Dewey arrives late both hungover and unprepared for the day, and the principal warns that \"Ned\" will be expected to meet the school's high standards (\"Here at Horace Green\"). Dewey enters his classroom and introduces himself as Mr. Schneebly. His thirteen students are immediately wary of him, and one of them, uptight Summer Hathaway, attempts to explain to him how the classes manage, and Dewey is disgusted by the rigid system. With no food to treat his hangover, Dewey spends most of the day sleeping, leaving the students to run wild.\n\nAt the apartment, Patty asks Ned to go on a jog with her, but he declines, claiming he has a lot of papers to grade. Understanding, Patty goes. However, as soon as she's gone, Ned pulls out his Guitar Hero console and begins playing. When Dewey comes home, he joins Ned and they discuss various topics such as teaching and their old band (\"Variation 7\u201d). After their game, Dewey attempts to convince Ned to rejoin him in their music career, by reminding him of all the perks of being a rockstar (\"Children of Rock\u201d). However, Patty arrives and breaks up the men's reminiscing session. Angry at Dewey, Patty reminds him that he's nothing more than a dreamer who will never succeed in the rock business, and gives him an ultimatum: pay the rent in thirty days, or they will kick him out (\"Give Up Your Dreams\u201d).\n\nThe next day at school, Dewey argues with another teacher and hears music coming from one of the classrooms. Upon learning that his students are in music class with Rosalie (\"Queen of the Night\"), he inquires in amazement about what instruments they play. Dewey then tells his students that they're now a part of his new band set to compete in the Battle of the Bands. First, he puts together the instrumentals of his band: Zack on electric guitar, Katie on bass guitar, Lawrence on keyboards, and Freddy on drums. He also makes two of the girls\u2014Shonelle and Marcy\u2014backup singers, and two other girls\u2014Madison and Sophie\u2014roadies. Then he moves onto technical jobs. Mason is put in charge of lights, James is made the security officer, and an ecstatic Billy is made the band's stylist. Summer is angry that she hasn't been given a job and says \"groupies are sluts\" in response to Dewey's first suggestion. Dewey then makes her the band's manager. The only student left without a job is Tomika, the shy new girl (\"You're in the Band\"). Confident about their prospects, Dewey hands out famous CDs to the students to listen to as homework (\"You're in the Band (Reprise)\u201d).\n\nThe children go home, and a glimpse is seen in some of their home lives:\n\nFrustrated, Zack, Tomika, Billy, Freddy, and the other students lament that they have so much to tell and offer their parents and the world, but they just won't listen to them yet (\"If Only You Would Listen\"). The kids are concerned about what they will play, leading to Dewey improvising the first version of (\"In the End of Time (A Cappella Version)\").\n\nIn the Faculty Lounge, the other teachers complain that the children have become undisciplined under Dewey (\"Faculty Quadrille\"). In the classroom, the band continues practicing Dewey's new song (\"In the End of Time (Practice Version)\"). After playing, Dewey tells everyone they're doing great. However, Zack is playing in an uptight and rigid manner, and Dewey says that Zack needs to get angry at \"the Man\" in order to really rock. He explains that the man is responsible for everything wrong with the world, and Dewey and the kids get angry and shout about how they're going to stick it to the Man (\"Stick it to the Man\"). Shonelle and Marcy say that they should call the band School of Rock . On account of being stuck in school, Dewey and the kids end up sneaking out of the building in order to make it to the Battle of the Bands auditions on time. The children and Dewey sadly arrive late at the auditions. With the manager about to leave, Summer convinces him to stay with a lie about a terminal illness and the class is able to compete (\"In the End of Time (The Audition)\"). They qualify and celebrate their success (\"Stick it to the Man (Reprise)\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThirty-six hours before the Battle of the Bands, the students are hard at work preparing for the event while Dewey attends a faculty conference. The students conclude that the one outstanding issue is the costumes, which Billy has yet to show anybody. He argues that they aren't finished yet, but Summer makes him show them anyway. Using Lawrence as an unwilling model, Billy shows everyone, and they hate them. Annoyed but not disheartened, Billy goes back to the drawing board (\"Time to Play\"). At the faculty meeting which Rosalie uses to stress the importance of parents' night, Dewey discovers that she is secretly a rocker, and loves Stevie Nicks . Dewey panics when he gets back to the classroom and begins to think of a cover. Tomika summons the courage to speak to him saying that she wants to sing. When Dewey asks why she didn't respond to the call for backup singers, she states that she's a lead singer and can\u2019t sing backup. Although initially too nervous, Tomika begins to sing when others are not looking and it turns out that she has the voice of a perfect angel (\"Amazing Grace\").\n\nUpon hearing that Rosalie is coming, students quickly cover their instruments with Thanksgiving -themed items and Dewey breaks into a fake lesson. When she challenges this, Dewey accuses other teachers of being on crack before admitting that he uses music to teach \"boring\" subjects. After arguing that there are no boring subjects, Rosalie announces that she will be sitting in for the rest of Dewey's lesson. Nervous, Dewey pulls out his guitar and improvises a song about math (\"Math Is a Wonderful Thing\"). Rosalie is unimpressed, but Dewey decides to ask her out to a bar regardless. Later that night, Rosalie and Dewey meet at the bar, and, after having a few drinks, Dewey plays a Stevie Nicks song on the jukebox, causing Rosalie to let loose and laments about how she feels she has lost her inner music. Stating that Dewey has reminded her about it, she promises that if the parents' meeting goes well the next day, she will help Dewey and School of Rock go to the Battle of the Bands (\"Where Did the Rock Go?\"). Dewey impulsively kisses Rosalie, and they part ways.\n\nDewey arrives home just as Patty and Ned are going through the mail. Prompted by the discovery of Dewey's paycheck made out to Ned, Dewey explains his impersonation idea. Ned goes into a panic attack, but Dewey manages to calm him down and make him promise not to tell Patty. The next day, the students go to rehearse their song, but then Zack reveals that he wrote his own song for the band in his free time. Dewey is floored by Zack's talent, and has Zack teach the song to the rest of the band (\"School of Rock (Band Practice)\"). However, in the middle of the practice, Rosalie unwittingly brings the students' parents into the classroom, and they are appalled by what is going on. Focusing on the talent of each child, Dewey slowly convinces the parents to see the band in a positive light until Patty and Ned burst in. Having extracted the information from Ned, Patty reveals that Dewey is not Ned Schneebly and sends the parents into a rage, and Dewey and the children escape in the commotion (\"Dewey's Confession\").\n\nAs Rosalie paces nervously in the halls, she finds Mason and reminds him that Dewey isn't who the students think he is. Mason counters that he is a role-model regardless of his name. Touched by this, Rosalie misleads the parents to buy the children more time. The children use this time to reinvigorate Dewey who has given up on his dream and returned to his room. Led by Tomika, they all explain how much they need him (\"If Only You Would Listen (Reprise)\"). Discovering that they stole the bus to head to the Battle, Dewey's dream is reignited (\"Stick it to the Man (Reprise)\"). Patty makes one last attempt to stop them, but Ned finally stands up to her and accompanies them to the Battle. The band arrives just as No Vacancy is finishing up their performance (\"I'm Too Hot for You (Reprise)\"). Dewey decides that they should play Zack's song and accepts new costumes from Billy. The parents arrive but are not allowed backstage by the security guards. As the students go to perform, Zack's father begins shouting at his son not to go onstage, telling him that School of Rock is ridiculous and stupid. Finally having enough, Zack stands up to his father and tells him that the band means more to him than he does, and then goes to play with the band.\n\nThe School of Rock performs Zack's song, and the crowd goes wild. Their parents watch on from an empty box seat, and each of them slowly fall in love with the band and how amazing their children are. Each of the instrumental students gets a solo, and Tomika sings lead with Dewey as well. By the end, Zack's father is frozen with pride and has to be pulled away by Summer's mother (\"School of Rock (Teacher's Pet)\"). After the performance, Rosalie and the band's parents congratulate the group, as well as Ned who has decked out in full heavy metal gear for the Battle. Dewey watches the parents and their kids, and finally feels as though he has accomplished something worthwhile. Patty then enters with a police officer and tries to get Dewey arrested for fraud, but Rosalie convinces the officer that Mr. Finn is Horace Green's official Band Coach. The winner of the competition is announced as No Vacancy , but Dewey assures everyone that winning didn't really matter because they did something even more special. To please an enthralled crowd, the band plays an encore (\"Stick It to the Man (Encore)\"). After their song, Dewey and Rosalie kiss again, and Rosalie mixes her classical singing with the heavy rock music of School of Rock , implying that a change is coming to Horace Green and its curriculum because of the band and Dewey (\"Finale\").",

        "title": "The Secret Garden (musical)",
        "description": "The Secret Garden is a musical based on the 1911 novel of the same name by Frances Hodgson Burnett . The musical's script and lyrics are by Marsha Norman , with music by Lucy Simon . It premiered on Broadway in 1991 and ran for 709 performances.\n\nThe story is set in the early years of the 20th century. Mary Lennox, an English girl born and raised in the British Raj , is orphaned by a cholera outbreak when she is ten years old. She is sent away from India to the moors of Yorkshire , England, to live in the manor of a brooding uncle she has never met. There, her personality blossoms among the other residents of the manor as they bring new life to a long-neglected garden.\n\nAn entirely different musical version of the novel, book and music written by the team of Jay Turvey and Paul Sportelli, premiered at Canada's Shaw Festival in 2024.",
        "synopsis": "This synopsis describes the original Broadway production; the reworked London production altered this sequence by moving or omitting several scenes and songs.\n\n### Act I\n\nMary Lennox, a sickly 10-year-old English girl who has lived mostly in isolation in India since birth, dreams of English nursery rhymes and Hindi chants (\"Opening\"). Survivors of a cholera outbreak discover Mary and inform her that her parents and nearly everyone she knew, including her Ayah , have died during the epidemic (\"There's a Girl\").\n\nMary is sent to live in England with her mysterious uncle Archibald Craven, a reclusive hunchback who has spent years grieving the death of his wife, Lily. Due to Archibald's introversion, the management of his manor house , Misselthwaite, is largely left to his manipulative brother, Dr. Neville Craven. The housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock, coldly welcomes Mary to Yorkshire (\"The House Upon the Hill\"). Due to Archibald and Mary's lingering grief, the house is haunted by ghosts from their pasts (identified in the libretto as \"dreamers\" who sometimes act as a Greek chorus of narrators, including the ghosts of Mary's parents, Rose and Albert). Lonely and misbehaving, Mary despises her new surroundings and her first night there hears echoes of crying voices (\"I Heard Someone Crying\"). The next morning, Mary meets Martha, a young chambermaid who encourages Mary to go play outside by telling her about the surrounding moorland and, in particular, a hidden garden (\"If I Had a Fine White Horse\"). Archibald remains submerged in his ghostly memories of Lily (\"A Girl In the Valley\").\n\nMary explores the grounds' Victorian -style topiary maze , discovering the walled garden overgrown with ivy. She encounters the old gardener Ben Weatherstaff (\"It's a Maze\"), who says the garden has been locked since Lily's death, as it reminds Archibald of her, and its door has been lost somewhere behind the weeds. Martha's mystical brother, Dickon, invokes the spring (\"Winter's On the Wing\") in a rustic druid -like fashion. When he comes upon Mary, he gives her some seeds, claims that he can converse with animals, and teaches her to speak the Yorkshire dialect to a robin , which guides Mary to the garden's secret key (\"Show Me the Key\").\n\nInside the manor, Neville and Archibald are discussing how Neville abandoned his medical practice to take care of a bedridden boy when Mary suddenly enters. She asks Archibald for a bit of earth to plant a garden of her own. He allows it and, after she leaves, confides to Neville that his dreams of Lily have been worsening, which Neville blames on the arrival of Mary, who bears a strong physical resemblance to her aunt Lily. Curious at the simple modesty of Mary's request for some earth, Archibald muses on Lily and Mary's shared interest in gardening (\"A Bit of Earth\"). As the Yorkshire gloom turns to a fearsome storm (\"Storm I\"), Archibald and Neville grieve separately over Lily; thus, it is revealed that both men were in love with her (\"Lily's Eyes\"). Mary again hears crying (\"Storm II\"), but this time she uncovers its source: Colin, a secret cousin of hers who has been confined to bed since his birth, when his mother Lily died. Colin has been in bed his entire life because his father Archibald, probably following Neville's misleading medical advice, feared that Colin would also become a hunchback. Colin confides in Mary that he nightly dreams of a man who comes to him and reads from a magical book (\"A Round-Shouldered Man\"). However, just as Mary and Colin embrace each other's long-desired company, Neville and Mrs. Medlock burst in and angrily tell her she is never to see Colin again because of his fragile medical condition. As the storm reaches its peak, a distraught Mary runs outside, where the ghost of Lily reveals the location of the hidden door to the garden, and Mary inserts the key (\"Final Storm\").\n\n### Act II\n\nMary has a reverie about her loved ones and her desire for the garden to offer her privacy and the chance to discover herself (\"The Girl I Mean to Be\"). Neville's musings are darker; enviously recalling his unrequited love for Lily. Neville wants Archibald to leave Misselthwaite entirely to him. The two brothers' thoughts are interwoven with ghostly echoes of old arguments between Lily and her sister Rose (Mary's mother) about Archibald's suitability as a prospective husband and father (\"Quartet\"). The melancholy Archibald has decided to slip away to Paris for a while, pausing only to read a fairy tale to Colin while the boy sleeps (\"Race You To the Top of the Morning\"). Thus, the \"round-shouldered man\" is not a dream at all but merely Colin's own father, who, despite his emotional devastation, still deeply loves his son.\n\nMary tells Dickon that she has now been inside the garden but the plants are all dead. Dickon explains that it is probably just dormant and that, with some assistance, it will grow back (\"Wick\"). Mary tells Colin about the garden, but he is reluctant to go outside until he is encouraged by an inviting vision of his mother Lily (\"Come to My Garden/Lift Me Up\"). Mary, Dickon, and Martha clandestinely bring Colin to the garden in a wheelchair. In the garden, the exercise, fresh air, and magical incantations in both Hindi and English led by Mary, the ghosts, and the manor staff strengthen Colin, allowing him to rise from his wheelchair for the first time (\"Come Spirit, Come Charm\"). Ben reveals that Lily died giving birth to Colin from injuries sustained during an accident in the garden. Colin makes Mary and the staff promise not to tell Archibald about Colin's recovery until he is able to fully walk. The onlooking ghosts sing the praises of the renewed garden (\"A Bit of Earth (Reprise)\").\n\nBack in the house, Neville faces down Mary as he threatens to send her away to boarding school, culminating in a violent confrontation between the doctor and the girl (\"Disappear\"). Immediately after, Martha soothes Mary, telling her to stay strong (\"Hold On\"). With Martha's help, Mary writes to Archibald in Paris (\"Letter Song\"), urging him to come home. Archibald's emotional turmoil continues to dominate him (\"Where In the World\"); however, Lily's ghost reappears, Archibald is able to see her, and she tells him that she always loved him. They come to the conclusion that her death was no one's fault, and Archibald can finally let her go as she tells him to care for their child and go home (\"How Could I Ever Know\"). Returning, he enters the garden to find Colin completely healthy; in fact, he is beating Mary in a footrace when Archibald walks through the door. Archibald, a changed man, sends Neville away to his Paris flat and triumphantly embraces Mary and Colin back into his life. The spirits of Mary's parents join Lily, promising to keep the living safe for the rest of their days (\"Finale\").\n\n### Changes from the original novel\n\nBurnett's novel primarily focused on Mary and her interactions with Colin, Martha, and Dickon. The musical adds more emphasis on the adult characters by presenting (and to some extent, inventing) the shared history entwining the two families. Originally, Burnett stated that the name of Archibald's wife was Lilias, and that she was the sister of Mary Lennox's father; in the musical, Colin's and Mary's mothers are sisters named Lily and Rose respectively.\n\nIn the book, Colin's private physician is an otherwise unnamed poor cousin of Archibald Craven; Colin privately remarks to Mary that Dr. Craven is the next heir to Misselthwaite and \"always looks cheerful when [Colin's health] is worse\", but Burnett also states that Dr. Craven is \"not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak one, and he did not intend to let [Colin] run into actual danger\". The musical heightens the doctor's conflict of interest and makes him the primary antagonist as Archibald's brother, Dr. Neville Craven, who once hopelessly loved Lily. Mary expressly accuses of him of wanting Colin to die for the sake of his inheritance.",

        "synopsis": "Just before Tess Harding, a nationally known television news personality, comes on stage to receive an award as \"Woman of the Year\", she reminisces about an on-air editorial that she gave denigrating newspaper comic strips .  The article offended the cartoonists who frequent the Ink Pot saloon and inspired syndicated cartoonist Sam Craig to publish a caricature depicting her as a snob in his strip Katz .

At the Ink Pot, she charms Sam and his colleagues by revealing her knowledge about comic art.\n\nTess and Sam begin a romance, move in together, and finally marry, but their busy careers leave little time for them to spend together, and their big egos pose problems in their marriage.

Tess is offended, an argument ensues, and Sam announces he no longer can deal with the couple's fraying love life.

She seeks advice from Russian ballet dancer Alexi Petrikov, whom she helped to defect. He tells her that he is returning to Russia, because the wife he left behind is more important than his career. Tess travels to visit first husband Larry Donovan and his wife Jan to discover why their marriage is a success. She decides to concentrate on her marriage and announces that she is resigning from her show.  But Sam tells her that he wants her to keep her career; he just wants to be involved in the decisions in their relationship.  They decide to work things out.",

        "synopsis": "The citizens of London, who act as a Greek chorus throughout the play, drop a body bag and pour ashes into a shallow grave. Sweeney Todd rises forth (\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\"), and introduces the drama.\n\n### Act I\n\nIn 1846, young sailor Anthony Hope and the mysterious Sweeney Todd, whom Anthony has recently rescued at sea and befriended, dock in London. A beggar woman sexually solicits them, appearing to recognize Todd for a moment (\"No Place Like London\"), and Todd shoos her away. Todd obliquely relates some of his troubled past to Anthony: he was a na\u00efve barber, and a corrupt judge who lusted after Todd's beautiful wife removed him as an obstacle (\"The Barber and His Wife\"). Leaving Anthony, Todd enters a meat pie shop on Fleet Street , where the owner, the slatternly widow Mrs. Lovett , laments the scarcity of meat and customers (\"Worst Pies in London\"). When Todd asks after the empty upstairs apartment, she reveals that its former tenant, Benjamin Barker, was transported for life based on false charges by Judge Turpin , who, along with his servant, Beadle Bamford, then lured Barker's wife Lucy to a masked ball at the Judge's home and raped her (\"Poor Thing\").\n\nTodd's reaction reveals that he is himself Benjamin Barker. Promising to keep his secret, Mrs. Lovett explains that Lucy poisoned herself with arsenic and that their then-infant daughter, Johanna , became the Judge's ward . Todd swears revenge on the Judge and the Beadle, and Mrs. Lovett presents Todd with his old collection of sterling silver straight razors , which persuades Todd to take up his old profession (\"My Friends\" and \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" \u2013 reprise). Elsewhere, Anthony spies a beautiful girl singing at her window (\"Green Finch and Linnet Bird\"), and the beggar woman tells him that her name is Johanna. Unaware that Johanna is his friend Todd's daughter, Anthony is immediately enamored (\"Ah, Miss\"), and he pledges to return for her, even after the judge and the Beadle threaten him and chase him away (\"Johanna\").\n\nIn the crowded London marketplace, flamboyant Italian barber Adolfo Pirelli and his simple-minded young assistant Tobias Ragg pitch a dramatic cure-all for hair loss (\"Pirelli's Miracle Elixir\"). Todd and Lovett soon arrive; as part of his plan to establish his new identity, Todd exposes the elixir as a sham, challenges Pirelli to a shaving competition and easily wins (\"The Contest\"), inviting the impressed Beadle for a free shave (\"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" \u2013 reprise 2). Several days later, Judge Turpin flagellates himself in a frenzy over a growing lust for Johanna, but instead resolves to marry her himself (\"Johanna \u2013 Mea Culpa\").\n\nTodd awaits the Beadle's arrival with mounting impatience, but Mrs. Lovett tries to soothe him (\"Wait\"). When Anthony tells Todd of his plan to ask Johanna to elope with him, Todd, eager to reunite with his daughter, agrees to let them use his barbershop as a safehouse. As Anthony leaves, Pirelli and Tobias enter, and Mrs. Lovett takes Tobias downstairs for a pie. Alone with Todd, Pirelli drops his Italian accent and reveals that he is really Daniel O'Higgins, Benjamin Barker's former assistant. He knows Todd's true identity (having recognized Barker's illustrious shaving tools during their earlier competition) and demands half his income for life. Todd kills O'Higgins by slitting his throat (\"Pirelli's Death\" and \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" \u2013 reprise 3) and temporarily hides his body. Meanwhile, Johanna and Anthony plan their elopement (\"Kiss Me\"), while the Beadle recommends Todd's grooming services to the Judge so that the judge may better win Johanna's affections (\"Ladies in Their Sensitivities\").\n\nPanicked at first on learning of Pirelli's murder, Mrs. Lovett swipes his leftover coin purse and then asks Todd how he plans to dispose of the body. Suddenly, the judge enters; Todd quickly seats him and lulls him with a relaxing conversation (\"Pretty Women\"). Before Todd can kill the judge, however, Anthony re-enters and blurts out his elopement plan. The angry judge storms out, vowing never to return and to send Johanna away. Todd drives Anthony out in a fit of fury and, reminded of the evil he sees in London, resolves to depopulate the city by murdering his future customers since all people deserve to die: the wicked to be punished for their deeds, and the \"rest of us\" to be relieved of their misery (\"Epiphany\"). While discussing how to dispose of Pirelli's body, Mrs. Lovett is struck by a sudden idea and suggests that they use the bodies of Todd's victims in her meat pies, and Todd happily agrees (\"A Little Priest\").\n\n### Act II\n\nSeveral weeks later, Mrs. Lovett's pie shop has become a successful business, and Tobias works there as a waiter. The pies are very popular (\"God, That's Good!\"). Todd has acquired a special mechanical barber's chair that allows him to kill clients and then send their bodies directly through a chute into the pie shop's basement bakehouse. Casually slitting his customers' necks, Todd despairs of ever seeing Johanna, while Anthony searches London for her (\"Johanna \u2013 Quartet\"). Anthony finds Johanna locked away in a private lunatic asylum , but barely escapes being placed under arrest by the Beadle. After a day of hard work, while Todd remains fixated on his revenge, Mrs. Lovett envisions eloping with Todd and retiring to the seaside (\"By the Sea\"). Anthony arrives to beg Todd for help to free Johanna, and Todd, revitalised, instructs Anthony to rescue her by posing as a wigmaker intent on purchasing inmates' hair (\"Wigmaker Sequence\" and \"The Ballad...\" \u2013 reprise 4). However, once Anthony has departed, Todd sends a letter informing the Judge that Anthony will bring Johanna to his shop just after dark, and that he will hand her over (\"The Letter\") in order to lure him back to the shop.\n\nIn the pie shop, Tobias tells Mrs. Lovett of his skepticism about Todd and his own desire to protect her (\" Not While I'm Around \"). When he recognizes Pirelli's coin purse in Mrs. Lovett's hands, she distracts him by showing him the bakehouse, instructing him how to work the meat grinder and the oven before locking him in. Upstairs, she encounters the Beadle at her harmonium ; he has been asked by Lovett's neighbors to investigate the strange smoke and stench from the pie shop's chimney. Mrs. Lovett stalls the Beadle with \"Parlor Songs\" until Todd returns to offer the Beadle his promised \"free shave\"; Mrs. Lovett loudly plays her harmonium to cover the Beadle's screams above as Todd dispatches him. In the basement, Tobias discovers hair and fingernails in a pie he has been eating, just as the Beadle's fresh corpse comes tumbling through the chute. Terrified, he flees into the sewers below the bakehouse. Mrs. Lovett then informs Todd that Tobias has found out about their secret and they plot to kill him.\n\nAnthony arrives at the asylum to rescue Johanna, but is exposed when Johanna recognizes him. Anthony draws a pistol given to him by Todd, but cannot bring himself to shoot Jonas Fogg, the corrupt asylum owner; Johanna grabs the pistol and kills Fogg. As Anthony and Johanna flee, the asylum's freed inmates prophesy the end of the world, while Todd and Mrs. Lovett hunt through the sewers for Tobias, and the beggar woman fears what has become of the Beadle (\"City on Fire/Searching\").\n\nAnthony and Johanna (now disguised as a sailor) arrive at Todd's empty shop. Anthony leaves to seek a coach after he and Johanna reaffirm their love (\"Ah Miss\" \u2013 reprise). Johanna hears the beggar woman entering and hides in a trunk in the barbershop. The beggar woman seems to recognize the room (\"Beggar Woman's Lullaby\"). Todd enters and tries to force her to leave as she again seems to recognize him. Hearing the Judge outside, a frantic Todd kills the beggar woman, sending her body down the chute barely a moment before the Judge bursts in. Todd assures the Judge that Johanna is repentant, and the judge asks for a quick splash of cologne.\n\nOnce he has the Judge in his chair, Todd soothes him with another conversation on women, but this time he alludes to their \"fellow tastes in women\". The Judge recognizes him as Benjamin Barker just before Todd slashes his throat and sends him hurtling down the chute (\"The Judge's Return\"). Remembering Tobias, Todd starts to leave, but, realizing he has left his razor behind, returns just as the disguised Johanna rises, horrified, from the trunk. Not recognizing her, Todd attempts to kill her, just as Mrs. Lovett shrieks from the bakehouse below, providing a distraction for Johanna to escape. Downstairs, Mrs. Lovett is struggling with the dying Judge, who clutches at her dress. She then attempts to drag the beggar woman's body into the oven, but Todd arrives and, through a shaft of light, sees the lifeless face clearly for the first time: the beggar woman was his wife Lucy. Horrified, Todd accuses Mrs. Lovett of lying to him. Mrs. Lovett frantically denies it, explaining that Lucy did indeed poison herself, but lived, although the attempt left her insane. Mrs. Lovett then tells Todd she loves him and would be a better wife than Lucy ever could have been. Todd feigns forgiveness, dancing manically with Mrs. Lovett until he hurls her into the oven, burning her alive. Todd, in shock and despair, embraces the dead Lucy. Tobias, now insane and his hair turned white, crawls up from the sewer babbling nursery rhymes to himself. He picks up Todd's fallen razor and slits Todd's throat. As Todd falls dead and Tobias drops the razor, Anthony, Johanna and some constables break into the bakehouse. Tobias, heedless of them, begins turning the meat grinder, crooning Mrs. Lovett's previous instructions to him (\"Final Scene\").\n\n### Epilogue\n\nThe ensemble cast, soon joined by the risen Todd and Mrs. Lovett, sing a final reprise of \"The Ballad of Sweeney Todd\" warning against revenge (though admitting that \"everyone does it\"). Tearing off their costumes, the company exits. Todd sneers and vanishes.",

It is inspired by the 2005 fictional biography Zorro , the first original story of the pulp hero Zorro , written by Chilean author Isabel Allende (itself a prequel to the events of the original Zorro story which is the 1919 novella The Curse of Capistrano by Johnston McCulley , but excludes the mute butler Bernardo). It also contains numerous references to earlier Zorro-related works, especially the 1998 film The Mask of Zorro .

The official opening was 15 July 2008. Christopher Renshaw directed and Rafael Amargo choreographed. The cast featured Matt Rawle as Zorro/Diego De La Vega, Emma Williams as Luisa, Adam Levy as Ramon, Lesli Margherita as Inez, Nick Cavaliere as Sergeant Garcia, and Jonathan Newth as Don Alejandro De La Vega.\n\nZorro ran at the Garrick for almost nine months, with its final performance on 14 March 2009.\n\nA new concert version, was produced by 'Take Two Theatricals' in February 2020.

        "synopsis": "### Prologue\n\nDeep inside a cave, a band of gypsies stop to rest for the night, while dancing and singing, they listen eagerly as their leader tells them about an old gypsy myth - the infamous story of the legendary hero, Zorro.\n\n### Act I\n\nDon Diego de la Vega, a wealthy young caballero, is sent away from his California home by his father, Don Alejandro, to school in Spain. He is forced to leave his childhood love Luisa, who is also being sent away by Diego's father. At the same time, Don Alejandro announces that Diego and Luisa's childhood friend Ramon shall become captain of the army, which pleases both Diego and Luisa.\n\nLater, in Spain, Diego has run away from school and joined a band of gypsies who perform in the backstreets of the city (\"Baila Me\"). He is their star attraction, and after showing several tricks to an enthralled audience, he sees Luisa. Luisa persuades Diego to return to California to stop Ramon, who has become a tyrant. Inez, another gypsy and evidently Diego's lover, is not pleased to see Luisa and decides that she and all the other gypsies must accompany them. In California, Diego finds that Ramon has stripped the people of their rights and has put himself in charge ever since Don Alejandro \"died.\" However, unbeknownst to everyone, Don Alejandro is not dead and is being held captive by Ramon. Ramon demonstrates his cruelty by sentencing three men to death for stealing; the men had added rocks to their sacks of grain to gain extra money for their hungry families. As the men are taken away, their women angrily declare their hatred of Ramon and his treatment of the people (\"Libertad\").\n\nAfter witnessing the cruelty of his old friend, and with the help of Inez (the only one who knows his plans), Diego adopts a heroic alter ego, which the people name \"El Zorro\" (though Diego wanted to be called \"El Puma\" instead), to defend the people of the pueblo (\"Hope\"). At the same time, to keep his identity secret, he presents himself to Ramon as an idiot of no real threat. He offers himself to Ramon as a personal servant, a move that angers Luisa, who believes that she brought Diego back for nothing.\n\nThe following day, the three men prepare to be hanged. As they are led to the gallows, Luisa and the women of the pueblo lament over the way the pueblo used to be and express hope that things will get better (\"In One Day\"). Before the noose can be tightened, Zorro makes a name for himself by saving the prisoners. Zorro swings in spectacularly out of nowhere and manages to appear almost simultaneously as Zorro and Diego, so that no one will suspect Diego.\n\nAfter another spectacular rescue, Zorro flees from Ramon's guards and find himself in Luisa's room, having walked in on her while she is in the bath. Embarrassed, he lets it slip that he knows her name, but his identity is kept safe from her, and she begins to fall in love with Zorro, just as Diego has always been in love with her (\"Falling\").\n\nMeanwhile, the gypsies cause a stir in the pueblo by drinking and dancing together (\"Bamboleo/There's a Tale\"), enticing Ramon's cowardly but warm-hearted second-in-command Sergeant Garcia. Flirting and joking with Garcia, Inez soon finds a new admirer, and Garcia tries his best to act strong and brave like Zorro. However, Inez still has eyes for Diego and finds Garcia merely entertaining. Ramon, initially intrigued by the idea of free wine, eventually turns against the gypsies and their radical ways and tries to prevent their activities. He finally attempts to exert his power by forcing himself upon Luisa, the woman he lusts after but who hates everything that he has become. Zorro appears just in time to save Luisa and tricks Ramon into accidentally admitting that Don Alejandro is still alive. To show that he will always be watching him, Zorro forces Ramon to his knees and carves his signature \"Z\" into Ramon's chest, as Ramon screams in agony and anger.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe second act opens with the band of gypsies from the prologue reappearing on stage and performing a large song and dance routine. (\"Entrada\")\n\nWhen the storyline continues, Ramon reveals the full extent of his injury: he is permanently scarred with the mark of Zorro. The gypsies and citizens mock him, and he angrily declares a curfew and that anyone out after the curfew will be shot. The crowd protests (\"Freedom\"). Inez tells Luisa that it is too dangerous for her to stay in Los Angeles; Luisa says that she knows a place where Ramon can never find her.  Ramon orders the guards to shoot into the crowd. The people flee, leaving Inez and Ramon alone. She tells Ramon that his empire is crumbling around him and that soon his greed will consume him (\"Bamboleo (Reprise)\"). Ramon leaves in denial, but her words have a great effect on him.\n\nDiego tries to advise Garcia on how to express his love for Inez, but when she arrives, Garcia becomes embarrassed and runs off. Diego enquires about Luisa's whereabouts. Inez tells him and also admits that she understands that Diego loves Luisa. Diego, dressed as Zorro, finds the cave where Luisa is hiding. Luisa confesses her feelings to Zorro, and the two dance outside the cave together (\"Serenade\"). The dance ends with Diego kissing Luisa but then pulling away. Luisa asks him why he's so afraid of his feelings; outside the cave, Diego sadly confesses that he wants to be with Luisa but is afraid that he risks putting her life in danger (\"A Love We'll Never Live\").\n\nThe following day, Garcia tries to impress Inez (\"One More Beer\"). Ramon, still distressed by Inez's words, goes to confession; he soon notices the priest is actually Zorro, who is trying to find out where Ramon is keeping Don Alejandro. Ramon sets a trap for Zorro, but Zorro manages to escape. Luisa goes to the gypsy camp where Inez transforms her into a gypsy (\"Djobi Djoba\"). Ramon bursts in and arrests Luisa. Inez calls Garcia a coward because he does nothing to stop Ramon.\n\nLuisa is about to be executed by a firing squad when Zorro, accompanied by several other men dressed as Zorro, fights off the guards. Ramon puts a knife to Inez's throat and tries to make Zorro choose between Luisa and Inez, but Inez throws Ramon to the ground. She tells Ramon that the love between Zorro and Luisa is a love that he can never know. Ramon produces a pistol from his pocket and fatally shoots Inez. After she dies in his arms, a heartbroken Zorro surrenders and is dragged away by the guards as Ramon forces Luisa to agree to marry him. As Ramon leaves with Luisa, the gypsies discover Inez's body and mournfully carry her away.\n\nIn his prison cell, Diego laments his failure to protect the people and blames himself for the suffering of the ones he loves (\"Hope (Reprise)\"). Garcia arrives and, admitting his cowardice, tells Zorro that he can take him to Don Alejandro. Meanwhile, Luisa is dressed by attendants for her wedding to Ramon. She wishes that she could have known the true identity of Zorro (\"The Man Behind the Mask\") and laments that in order to protect her love, she must sacrifice it as well as her happiness.\n\nAs the wedding begins, Zorro arrives, but this Zorro is revealed to be Don Alejandro, who confronts Ramon about his cruelty. An emboldened Garcia and the other guards turn against Ramon, charging him with murdering Inez. Don Alejandro orders Ramon to be arrested, but Ramon says that he will kill Luisa if they try. The wedding proceeds, but just before Luisa gives her vows, the real Zorro swings into the chapel.  During the ensuing sword fight with Ramon, Zorro reveals his true identity to Ramon and asks him to stop fighting, saying that they are brothers. Ramon appears to agree, but then draws a small knife and charges at him. Diego evades the blade and causes Ramon to fall on his own knife. Ramon is fatally wounded and dies with his final thoughts being him, Diego, and Luisa as children.\n\nDiego is distressed by what he has done, when Luisa and Don Alejandro reenter the room. Luisa, seeing that Zorro is unmasked, begs him to show her his face. Reluctantly he does so, and Luisa is shocked by the discovery that Zorro is Diego, but still declares that she loves him. The two kiss and embrace. All rejoice (\"Fiesta\").",

        "synopsis": "It is 1980 and chalk artist Sonny Malone is dissatisfied with his sidewalk mural of the Greek Muses (daughters of Zeus) and determines to kill himself. On Mount Olympus, Clio (pronounced \"Kleye-o\"), the youngest, perkiest Muse, convinces her six sisters (two of whom are men in drag), to travel to Venice Beach (rising out of the sidewalk mural) to inspire Sonny (\"I'm Alive\"). Zeus 's rules require that Muses must always be disguised from mortals. Clio has the idea to wear roller skates , leg warmers , and sport an Australian accent, and the other muses agree. Clio changes her name to something contemporary: \"Kira\". Quickly inspired (\"Magic\"), Sonny decides that he can combine all the arts and \"something athletic\" all into one spectacular entertainment: a roller disco.\n\nTwo of Clio's sisters, Melpomene (the oldest sister) and Calliope , are jealous that Clio (although the youngest) is the leader of the Muses and that Zeus had promised \"Xanadu\" to Clio, although no one knows exactly what that entails (\"Evil Woman\"). So they plot to discredit Clio and cause her banishment by tricking her into breaking one of Zeus's rules: a Muse must not fall in love with a mortal, so they will curse \"Kira\" and Sonny to fall in love.\n\nMeanwhile, Sonny finds a good location for the roller disco, a long-abandoned theater in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles called \"Xanadu\". \"Kira\" inspires him to locate the owner in the phone book (\"Suddenly\"), and they set up a meeting with real estate mogul Danny Maguire, who used to be a big band clarinetist before he started in the real estate game.\n\nSonny visits hard-hearted Danny in his posh office in downtown Los Angeles and tries to convince him to donate the theater for the roller disco, because it would bring the arts to the Fairfax district and drive up real estate values. But Danny scoffs, even though he had plans to open the theater himself, once upon a time. As Sonny leaves, \"Kira\" arrives, jogging Danny's memories of an old love and dance partner of his, who looked suspiciously like \"Kira\", named Kitty (\"Whenever You're Away from Me\"). Kira tells Danny that although he had let his greed stop him from pursuing his dream to open the theater 35 years ago, he has a chance to redeem himself now by opening the roller disco with Sonny. Danny finds Sonny and tells him that if he can get the disco up and running in one day, he'll give him 25% of the take from the Disco (\"Dancin'\"). Excited, Sonny readily agrees.\n\nSonny finds \"Kira\" and tells her the good news. She is not impressed with the deal that he has cut. It is then that the evil sisters work their curse, and the winged Eros , along with \"Mama Cupid\", shoots \"Kira\" and Sonny with the arrows of love (\"Strange Magic\"). \"Kira\" is soon overwhelmed with guilt over her loving feelings and of having created her own art (a hand-drawn picture) alongside Sonny \u2013 both violations of Zeus's restrictions on the Muses.\n\nWith the help of some of the muses, \"Kira\" and Sonny fix up the old theater (\"All Over the World\"), and Danny agrees to go ahead with the opening. Clio realizes that she is falling in love with Sonny and tells him that she must leave (\"Don't Walk Away\"). But the evil sisters are not finished. Now they offer Danny piles of money if he will tear down the theater and build condos. Danny can't resist and tells Sonny that the deal is off.\n\n\"Kira\" comes back to tell Sonny that she loves him, but the evil sisters tell her that she has broken Zeus's rules, and that she must tell Sonny the truth. So \"Kira\" reveals all to Sonny, including that her name is Clio, but he does not believe her and is upset. He suggests that she is a crackpot. He also doubts that she really loves him, and she is angry and hurt (\"Fool\"). The evil sisters have triumphed (\"The Fall\"), and Kira sets off for Mount Olympus to receive her punishment from Zeus (\"Suspended in Time\").\n\nMeanwhile, Sonny and Danny discuss \"Kira\" and after seeing her in the sky, it all makes sense. Danny tells Sonny not to let go of his muse because of foolish pride as he once did back in the 1940s. Sonny, realizing that he really loves \"Kira\", decides to find her - even if it means climbing Mount Olympus.\n\nBack on Mount Olympus, Zeus's wives ask him to take pity on Clio (\"Have You Never Been Mellow\"). Thetis retells the story of Achilles and his vulnerable heel. All the demi-gods and demi-goddesses are so afflicted. This gives Clio an epiphany: she, too, is invulnerable, except for her heels, but when the evil sisters had her shot with the arrows of love, she had been wearing the \"mighty legwarmers\", and so she must have been completely invulnerable. This means that she really did love Sonny. Kira then declares her love for Sonny and rips off her legwarmers (\"I'm Free\") and attempts to fly away with Pegasus and Sonny, before Zeus pulls them down with copper chains. Sonny brashly declares that he would even fight Zeus for the woman he loves. Zeus, impressed with his pluck, decides to pardon Clio. The two evil sisters are displeased, the lovers are reunited, and Zeus reveals what Xanadu is: \"True love and the ability to create and share art\". Clio and Sonny go back to L.A. and Xanadu (\"Xanadu\").",

        "description": "South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut is a 1999 American adult animated musical black comedy film based on the animated sitcom South Park . The film was directed by series creator Trey Parker , who co-wrote with series co-creator Matt Stone and Pam Brady . It stars Parker, Stone, Mary Kay Bergman , and Isaac Hayes , all of whom reprise their roles from the series, with George Clooney , Eric Idle , and Mike Judge in supporting roles. The plot follows Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski , Eric Cartman , and Kenny McCormick as they sneak into an R-rated film starring the Canadian comedy duo Terrance and Phillip , after which they begin swearing . When the consequent moral panic culminates in the United States declaring war on Canada, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman take it upon themselves to save Terrance and Phillip from execution, while Kenny tries to prevent a prophecy involving Satan and Saddam Hussein 's intent to conquer the world.\n\nPrimarily centered on themes of censorship and scapegoating, the film also parodies and satirizes the animated films of the Disney Renaissance , musicals such as Les Mis\u00e9rables , and controversies surrounding the series itself. The film also heavily satirizes the Motion Picture Association of America ; during production, Parker and Stone disputed with the MPAA, which returned the film multiple times with an NC-17 rating due to its frequent use of profanity. The film's songs were written by Parker and Marc Shaiman , the latter of whom composed the score .\n\nSouth Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut premiered at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on June 23, 1999, and was released theatrically in the United States and Canada a week later by Paramount Pictures , with Warner Bros. handling international distribution. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised its humor and themes. Produced on a $21\u00a0million budget, it grossed $83.1\u00a0million worldwide, making South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut the highest-grossing R-rated animated film until 2016, when it was beaten by Sausage Party . At the 72nd Academy Awards , the song \" Blame Canada \" was nominated for Best Original Song , but it lost to Phil Collins ' \" You'll Be in My Heart \" from Tarzan . The film has since been considered one of the greatest animated films of all time.",
        "synopsis": "In South Park, Colorado , Stan Marsh , Kyle Broflovski and his adopted brother Ike , Eric Cartman , and Kenny McCormick visit the movie theater to see Terrance and Phillip 's R-rated film, Asses of Fire , bribing a homeless man to accompany them so that they can be allowed in. As a result of the rampant profanity in the film, the boys begin swearing constantly and their classmates also go to see it, except for Stan's girlfriend Wendy Testaburger , who becomes close with transfer student Gregory, to Stan's chagrin. The boys are sent to Mr. Mackey 's office for swearing and are forbidden from seeing the film again by their parents, but still watch it again later. Kenny attempts to imitate one of the scenes from the film by lighting his fart on fire, causing him to immolate himself; Kenny is then rushed to the hospital and dies from a botched heart transplant and the rest of boys get grounded for disobeying their mother's orders about not going to see the Terrence and Phillip movie again.\n\nKenny descends into Hell and encounters Satan and his abusive partner Saddam Hussein . With Asses of Fire becoming popular with children nationwide, the parents of South Park blame Terrance and Phillip's home country, Canada, for their behavior. Kyle's mother, Sheila , forms the Mothers Against Canada (M.A.C.) movement with other parents and has Cartman installed with a V-chip, a device that administers him with an electric shock any time he attempts to curse. When the group arrests the comedians, Canada bombs the Baldwin family in retaliation. President Bill Clinton announces that in two days at a USO show, Terrance and Phillip will be executed to signal an American invasion of Canada. In Hell, Kenny witnesses Satan tell Saddam that the deaths of Terrance and Phillip are the last sign of a prophecy of a time he will be able to invade and conquer Earth. After failing to persuade Satan to abandon Saddam, Kenny's ghost visits Cartman to warn him. Unable to reason with their mothers, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman form a resistance movement with their classmates to rescue Terrance and Phillip, recruiting the French-accented, misotheistic Cristophe, nicknamed \"the Mole\".\n\nThe boys infiltrate the USO show, and Stan and Kyle attempt to stall the execution while Cartman attempts to deactivate the alarm and the Mole prepares to free Terrance and Phillip. However, Kenny's ghost reappears before Cartman, who runs away in fear before shutting down the alarm, and the Mole is fatally mauled by guard dogs. The remaining boys tried to warn their mothers about Satan's prophecy but are ignored, and Sheila orders the execution. This is interrupted when the Canadian Army launches a surprise attack, resulting in a massive battle between the two armies. Cartman deactivates the electrical switch, allowing Terrance and Phillip to escape; the shock from the switch causes his V-chip to malfunction. Horrified at what they have incited, all of the M.A.C. members except for Sheila decide to abandon their cause and search for their children. The children form a human shield to protect Terrance and Phillip from the United States Army and Kyle tries to reason with Sheila. While the army troops begin to back down, Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip dead.\n\nSatan's prophecy is fulfilled, and he and Saddam rise to Earth, but Saddam orders the soldiers of both armies to bow to him and browbeats Satan into letting him have power. Cartman curses at Saddam and his malfunctioning V-chip produces an electric shock he directs at Saddam, and the boys urge Cartman to continue swearing to electrocute him. Saddam demands Satan assist him while insulting him, eventually causing him to snap and throw Saddam back into Hell, where he is impaled on a stalagmite . Grateful for Kenny's support, Satan grants him one wish, and Kenny wishes for everything to return to a pre-war state, though doing so means that he will remain in Hell. Kenny bids farewell to his friends and all of those killed in the battle are returned to life, including Terrance and Phillip. As the Americans and Canadians make peace, Sheila reconciles with Kyle, as does Wendy with Stan. For his sacrifice, Kenny is allowed to enter Heaven.",

Its success led to productions in London's West End in 1978, winning the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical, and on Broadway a year later, where it was the first British musical to receive the Tony Award for Best Musical .\n\nThis has been followed by a string of professional tours and worldwide productions and numerous cast albums, as well as a 1996 film adaptation . The musical was revived in London's West End in 2006, 2014, 2017, and 2025, and on Broadway in 2012.",
        "synopsis": "Act I\n\nOn 26 July 1952, a crowd in a Buenos Aires , Argentina theatre is watching a movie (\"A Cinema in Buenos Aires, 26 July 1952\") that is interrupted when news breaks of the death of First Lady Eva Per\u00f3n . Both the crowd and the nation go into a period of public mourning (\"Requiem for Evita\") as Che, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did \"nothing for years\" (\" Oh What a Circus \").\n\nIn 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte lives in the city of Jun\u00edn , and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva takes up with a tango singer-songwriter, Agust\u00edn Magaldi , after she meets him at one of his shows (\"On This Night of a Thousand Stars\"). Eva persuades an initially resistant Magaldi to take her with him to Buenos Aires (\"Eva, Beware of the City\"). Upon her arrival in the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory (\"Buenos Aires\").\n\nAfter her arrival, Eva is quick to leave Magaldi and pursue other romantic connections to climb up the social ladder (\"Goodnight and Thank You\"). Che tells of both a coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n , an ambitious army colonel making his way up the Argentine political ladder (\"The Lady's Got Potential\"). Per\u00f3n and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy, with Per\u00f3n rising above the pack (\"The Art of the Possible\").\n\nAfter a massive earthquake hits the town of San Juan , Per\u00f3n organizes a charity concert at Luna Park to provide aid to the earthquake's victims, which Eva attends. Per\u00f3n's rousing speech is well-received by the crowd (\"Charity Concert\"). Eva introduces herself to Per\u00f3n and they share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Per\u00f3n rise to power (\"I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You\"). Eva dismisses Per\u00f3n's unnamed mistress, who ponders the rejection and her fate (\" Another Suitcase in Another Hall \").\n\nUpon moving in with Per\u00f3n, Eva is introduced to high society only to be met with disdain from the upper classes and the Argentine Army (\"Per\u00f3n's Latest Flame\"). In 1946, after launching his presidential bid, Per\u00f3n discusses his chances of winning the election with Eva. After reassuring him of their chances of winning, Eva organizes rallies for the descamisados (shirtless ones) and gives them hope for a better future while Per\u00f3n and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way (\"A New Argentina\").\n\nAct II\n\nPer\u00f3n is elected President in a sweeping victory in 1946. He stands \"On The Balcony of the Casa Rosada \" addressing his descamisados . Eva speaks from the balcony of the Presidential Palace to her adoring supporters, where she proclaims that despite her elevated status, her heart remains with the people of her country (\" Don't Cry for Me Argentina \"). Che analyses the price of fame as Eva dances at the Inaugural Ball with Per\u00f3n, now the president-elect (\"High Flying, Adored\").\n\nEva insists on a glamorous image to impress the people of Argentina and promote Peronism . She prepares to tour Europe as she is dressed for success by her fashion consultants (\"Rainbow High\"). Her famous 1947 tour meets with mixed results (\"Rainbow Tour\"); Spaniards adore her, but the Italians liken her husband to Benito Mussolini . France is impressed, and the British snub her by inviting her to a country estate, rather than Buckingham Palace . Eva affirms her disdain for the upper class, while Che asks her to start helping those in need as she made a promise (\"The Actress Hasn't Learned the Lines (You'd Like to Hear)\"). Eva begins the Eva Per\u00f3n Foundation to direct her charity work. Che describes Eva's controversial charitable work and possible money laundering (\"And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)\").\n\nEva appears at a church to take the sacrament in front of her adoring supporters (\"Santa Evita\"), but passes out suddenly, and while unconscious, appears to have a dream that reflects upon the conflicting views of her life. In her dream, she and Che heatedly debate her actions; Che accuses Eva of using the Argentine people for her own ends, while Eva cynically replies that there is no glory in trying to solve the world's problems from the sidelines (\"Waltz for Eva and Che\"). At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits to herself and Che that she is dying and can't go on for much longer. Che points out the disastrous results of Per\u00f3n's policies on Argentina: its treasury is bankrupt, its once-thriving beef industry is under rationing, and the press and other critics of the regime are muzzled.\n\nPer\u00f3n's generals finally get sick of Eva's meddling and demand that Per\u00f3n force her to leave politics. However, Per\u00f3n objects and claims that if it weren't for her, they would never have achieved as much as they have (\"She Is a Diamond\"). But he also concedes that she won't be able to keep working for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer . Even so, Eva is determined to run for Vice President , and Per\u00f3n fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists that she can continue, despite her failing health (\"Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet\").\n\nRealizing she is about to die, Eva renounces her pursuit of the vice presidency and swears her eternal love to the people of Argentina (\"Eva's Final Broadcast\"). Eva's numerous achievements flash before her eyes before she dies (\"Montage\"), and she asks for forgiveness, contemplating her choice of fame instead of long reign (\"Lament\"). Evita dies, and embalmers preserve her body forever. Che notes a monument was set to be built for Evita but says \"only the pedestal was completed, and Evita's body disappeared for 17 years.\"",

        "synopsis": "On New Year's Eve, 1905, saloon keeper \"Blackie\" Norton hires Mary Blake to sing in his bar, the Paradise Club on Pacific Street in the notorious Barbary Coast of San Francisco. Mary becomes a star attraction at the Paradise , especially for her signature tune, \"San Francisco\" . Blackie's friend Mat predicts that Mary will not stay long on the \"Coast\".\n\nBlackie decides to run for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors at the behest of his childhood friend Father Tim Mullen, who believes Blackie can use the supervisor position to implement reform.\n\nMary is hired by the Tivoli Opera House on Market Street , where she becomes involved with Nob Hill scion Jack Burley. After her performance one night, Blackie visits Mary in her dressing room. Realizing she still loves him, Mary asks him to marry her. Blackie agrees, but their reunion is soon interrupted by Burley, who had proposed to Mary prior to the show. Burley appeals to Mary, but Blackie presents Mary with an ultimatum by asking if she wants to marry him or stay at the Tivoli. Mary chooses to return to the Paradise .\n\nBackstage on the opening night of her return performance, Father Tim drops in and is angered by Mary's skimpy stage costume. He defies Blackie to put her on the stage in front of the rowdy Paradise audience. Mary decides to leave with the priest after Blackie strikes him in the face.\n\nMary goes back to Burley and meets his mother at her Nob Hill mansion. Mrs. Burley tells Mary that she had a \"Blackie\" in her younger days, but chose to marry the more steadfast Burley. This cements Mary's decision to accept Burley's proposal of marriage.\n\nOn the evening of April 17, 1906, Burley has the San Francisco Police Department raid the Paradise . Blackie, distraught about the future of his club, ends up at the city's annual Chickens Ball. After performances by acts from the other clubs, the MC requests the Paradise's entry. When no one steps on stage, Mary, just having learned of the club's closing, enters the competition on behalf of the Paradise . She rouses the audience to join in a chorus of \"San Francisco\" and wins, but Blackie refuses the prize money and states that Mary had no right to sing on behalf of his club. Mary is about to leave the ball with Burley when the earthquake hits the city .\n\nAs Blackie wanders the devastated city searching for Mary, he finds Burley dead and Mrs. Burley distraught. The police begin dynamiting buildings in order to control the fires. Blackie also comes upon a dying Mat, who tells Blackie he was wrong about Mary. Blackie later meets Father Tim, who takes him to a homeless camp in Golden Gate Park . Blackie hears Mary singing \" Nearer, My God, to Thee \" with those in mourning. As they reunite, word spreads through the camp that \"The fire's out!\" As people shout about building a new San Francisco, Blackie and Mary join the crowd as they leave the park marching arm-in-arm, singing \" The Battle Hymn of the Republic \".",

Adapted from the 1952 movie of the same name , the plot closely adheres to the original. Set in Hollywood in the waning days of the silent screen era, it focuses on romantic lead Don Lockwood, his sidekick Cosmo Brown, aspiring actress Kathy Selden, and Lockwood's leading lady Lina Lamont, whose less-than-dulcet vocal tones make her an unlikely candidate for stardom in talking pictures.\n\nThe show had its world premiere in 1983 at the London Palladium , where it ran for more than two years, and has spawned a Broadway production and many stagings worldwide.",
        "synopsis": "### 2012 West End revival\n\nOutside of Grauman's Chinese Theater in 1927 (\"Overture\"), celebrity news reporter, Dora Bailey, interviews Monumental Pictures' president R.F. Simpson, director Roscoe Dexter, actress Lina Lamont, her co-star and supposed fianc\u00e9e Don Lockwood, and Don's best friend and composer, Cosmo Brown. After being pressed by Dora and the audience in attendance, Don recaps his early days as an aspiring actor and vaudevillian , how he met Cosmo, and got his start in show business, which ultimately led to a talent scout seeing both Don and Cosmo's talents and recruiting them both for bigger projects. (\" Fit as a Fiddle \")\n\nInside the theater, fans applaud a screening of the latest Lockwood-Lamont picture, The Royal Rascal , as Don hastily pulls Lina off-stage during their post-film speech. Lina, who is revealed to have a harsh, nasally voice, proclaims Don to really be her \"fee-yan-see\" in spite of Don's clear resentment of her as well as the entire engagement being nothing more than a publicity stunt. Processing his feelings on the matter, Don decides to walk to the after-party being held at R.F.'s mansion, where he is accosted by crazed fans. Don manages to dissuade them by pretending to be a normal passer-by, claiming to be the boyfriend of a nearby woman. When the woman tries to call the police on Don, she eventually recognizes him and introduces herself as Kathy Selden, a stage actress. Unimpressed with Don's \"pantomime on the screen\", the two of them trade insults back and forth, with Don becoming completely smitten over Kathy (\" You Stepped Out of a Dream \"). When a crowd begins to form around Don, he quickly escapes the commotion as a mob of women tear off his jacket sleeve. During a transition, the men, now left behind by their dates, dance with a new group of women as the scene moves to R.F.'s mansion, where an already intoxicated Lina sings along. (\"Temptation Tango\")\n\nAt R.F.'s party, a demonstration of a \"talking picture\" is shown to the party-goers, with everyone visibly disturbed and conflicted at the revelation of the gadget. Afterwards, Lina tries to flirt with Don, only to be interrupted by Kathy jumping out of a massive cake, revealed to be nothing more than a showgirl who performs a dance routine for the guests (\" All I Do \"). Enraged that Don has found out her true occupation and annoyed by his constant belittlement, Kathy throws a pie at Don, only to end up hitting Lina. Kathy runs off in embarrassment, leaving Don regretful (\"You Stepped out of a Dream (Reprise)\").\n\nThree weeks later, Don is on the set of his newest film, The Dueling Cavalier , still heartbroken over losing Kathy. Cosmo tries to cheer Don up by reminding him of his acting chops (\" Make 'Em Laugh \"), before Dexter and his assistant directors begin filming. Lina reveals to Don that she had Kathy fired from her job at the Coconut Grove, causing Don to explode at her. R.F. interrupts the shoot to halt production, as Warner Brothers' latest film, The Jazz Singer (a talking picture), was a smash hit in spite of everyone's predictions of failure. Realizing \"talkies\" are the way of the future, R.F. orders Cavalier to be converted into a talking picture, much to the annoyance of Dexter and his crew.\n\nWhile filming a musical on another lot (\"Beautiful Girl\"), director Sid Phillips has Kathy, who was one of the dancers in the number, perform for R.F. for a chance at an upcoming role (\"You Are My Lucky Star\"). Cosmo, who performs the music for Kathy's audition, tells Don of his discovery, allowing Don to reunite with Kathy. Learning of Kathy's connection to Lina, R.F. hires Kathy in secret, as Don takes Kathy out to lunch and professes his love for her (\" You Were Meant for Me \").\n\nDon and Lina take diction courses in order to perfect their speech for their upcoming movie (\"Moses Supposes\"), as Dexter and his crew struggle to record Lina's lines efficiently (\"Moses Supposes (Reprise)\"). At the preview for Dueling Cavalier , the entire showing goes awry due to Lina's flat delivery, Don's uninspired improv, and the sound going out of synch from the picture. Scheduled to open in less than six weeks, the film looks to be the end of Don's screen career. After jokingly suggesting a return to vaudeville, Kathy recommends turning Cavalier into a musical to save its reputation. Don and Cosmo enthusiastically agree, and celebrate the brilliant idea (\" Good Mornin' \"). However, when Don realizes Lina won't be able to act or sing, Cosmo comes up with the idea to dub Lina's lines over with Kathy's vocals. Don is hesitant, believing Kathy would waste her career away, but agrees only after Kathy persuades him to do it. That night, after dropping Kathy off at home, Don dances in the streets on a cold, rainy night. (\" Singin' in the Rain \")\n\nAs reshoots begin on the newly-renamed The Dancing Cavalier , Kathy begins to record over Lina's lines in secret. (\"Would You?\") Don and Cosmo are thrilled over the progress being made on the film, but the excitement is ruined by a scorned Lina, who, thanks to her best friend and fellow actress, Zelda Zanders, finds Don and Kathy together. After Don reveals his intent to one day marry Kathy as well as Monumental's plans to not only re-record Lina's songs and dialogue but to also give Kathy a full screen credit, Lina runs off to her dressing room, distraught. Cosmo and Don calm Kathy's nerves as Lina laments to Zelda about Don's lack of romantic interest in her. (\"What's Wrong With Me?\")\n\nR.F. remains steadfast in his commitment to promoting Kathy's big debut, in spite of Lina's threats. As Dexter ponders how to film Cavalier's final dance number, R.F. suggests \"tap dancing! We've got to have tap dancing!\". With that, Cosmo helps R.F. and Dexter visualize a big production number featuring an elaborate tap sequence under the pretense of a modern framing device (\"Broadway Ballet\"/\"Broadway Melody\"). R.F., still unconvinced, asks Cosmo to do the whole number over again. Cosmo exaggeratedly passes out in exhaustion.\n\nAt the premiere of The Dancing Cavalier , Dexter and R.F. learn from Rod, the head of Monumental's publicity department, that newspapers all over town are publishing articles claiming Lina to be singing her own songs. As Rod bemoans the lack of communication and the money wasted on Kathy's campaign that will no longer come to fruition, Lina approaches the trio, revealing that she had read a clause in her contract that allows her to control her own publicity, not the studio. A defeated R.F. has no choice but to agree to Lina's demands at the risk of a lawsuit, in addition to forcing Kathy into becoming Lina's permanent vocal replacement without credit.\n\nAfter the showing, Don, Cosmo, and Kathy celebrate their hard work as Lina reveals her scheme to ride off Kathy's success. As R.F. struggles to stand up to Lina and Rod continues complying to Lina's demands, Don plots to reveal Lina's deception to the audience in attendance by having her deliver the post-screening speech instead of him. When the audience becomes confused at Lina's real voice over the one she used in the movie, they demand she sing. R.F., Don, and Cosmo force Kathy to sing backstage into a microphone for Lina to lip-synch to, reminding Kathy of her iron-clad contract with Monumental. Feeling betrayed, Kathy breaks up with Don as she begins to sing for Lina. (\"Would You? (Reprise)\") However, Don raises the curtain on Lina to reveal Kathy singing in her stead, as Cosmo takes over to sing for Lina, humiliating her into running off-stage. Kathy tries to flee through the crowd, but is stopped by Don, who tells the audience that she, is in fact, the real star of the picture (\"You Are My Lucky Star (Reprise)\"). The two embrace as the show ends. (\"Singin' in the Rain (Finale)\")",

Rather than listening to her as she requests, he proposes that having a baby will solve her problems (\" Make Me \"). The two are interrupted by the Narrator, who offers notes before it is time to act out Cinderella's wedding. Questioned if she was late on her entrance, Cinderella reveals to the Narrator she feels lonely despite living her happy ever after. Later, Cinderella arrives to scroll club. Though the other princesses find Little Mermaid 's story romantic, Cinderella questions if she should give up her voice and live--all that she has--to save her prince and if that is really happy ever after. The princesses, led by Cinderella, realize they want more than their fairytales' happy ever afters (\" Lucky \").\n\nAlone in the forest, Cinderella wishes for \"more,\" which summons O.F.G., the original fairy godmother . O.F.G. introduces Cinderella to Betty Friedan 's The Feminine Mystique and begins to deconstruct some of the problematic tropes of the fairytale Cinderella lives in. O.F.G. reveals that she has escaped Story's End to Flatbush with Betty Friedan's ideas and encourages Cinderella to read the book but keep it hidden. Called to the work scene, Cinderella reads as her stepsisters demand she clean the palace. As she becomes more empowered, the Stepmother catches Cinderella reading and takes the book (\" Work Bitch \").\n\nCinderella reveals to Snow White that she met O.F.G., who gave her a book that has changed the way she views the world. Snow White volunteers to go help get the book back, even though it is dangerous to enter another princess's story, and the two sings a song celebrating their friendship (\"Brightest Morning Star\").\n\nAt the palace, princes and princesses arrive to Prince Charming's ball (\" Boys \" / \" Pretty Girls \"). Cinderella and Snow White sneak into the palace, and after the two split up, Cinderella runs into the Stepmother, who proposes that she can have the book back if she rejects the prince and allows one of her daughters to take Cinderella's place. As the Stepmother is about to discuss her daughters with the Narrator, Prince Charming arrives to the palace (\" Circus \"). Cinderella and Prince Charming have their first dance, and at first, Cinderella begins to reject the Prince but is overcome by his eyes (\" Sometimes \"). Snow White returns and interrupts, calling Prince Charming her prince, and Cinderella and Snow White realize he has been cheating on both of them. In response, Prince Charming blows them off, and though Cinderella is furious, Snow White is heartbroken (\" Oops!...I Did It Again \"). Later at scroll club, Snow White sings about her broken heart (\" From the Bottom of My Broken Heart \"). Cinderella begins to tell the princesses about the book, but the Narrator enters, reprimanding Snow White and Cinderella, who tries to stand up for the two but is shot down with sexist comments.\n\nBack in the forest, Cinderella tells the mice that she doesn't see the point in dreaming anymore, which summons O.F.G., who encourages her to get the book back through being assertive and self-reliant. Cinderella is called to the dress-making scene. Though her stepsisters tirade her again, forcing her to do housework, she stands up for herself and gets her book back (\" Piece of Me \" / \"Cinderella\").\n\nCinderella calls all the princesses to Rapunzel's tower to share the book, but at the tower, the princesses run into Prince Charming, who is revealed to be the Prince in everyone's story. The princesses call him out and push him down into a wishing well (\" Womanizer \"). Cinderella wishes for more books for the princesses, at first summoning Private Parts by Howard Stern because her wish was not specific enough. After wishing for \"Princess Betty's books,\" O.F.G. enters with copies of The Feminine Mystique for everyone, and as they read, they become empowered and ready to Flatbush, a place beyond Story's End that they associate with women's freedom (\" Scream & Shout \" / \" I Wanna Go \").\n\n### Act II\n\nWhile the narrator is distraught that the princesses are no longer following their fairytales and seeks to stop them, Cinderella and the princesses are excited for the future (\" Crazy \"). The Stepmother attempts to indirectly suggest to the Narrator to replace Cinderella with one of her daughters, but he decides to try to remain as true to the fairytale and call Prince Charming. At the palace, Prince Erudite reveals to Prince Charming that just like in Prince Charming's speech, he believes he has found true love -- not a her but a him. Though Prince Charming believes it must be him, Prince Erudite runs to go find his love, leaving Charming alone, away from both Cinderella and Prince Erudite. After the Narrator asks Prince Charming to bring back Cinderella, Prince Charming decides that because she already has both her slippers, the way to bring her back is to learn how to read and create his own scroll club (\" 3 \").\n\nThe princesses and other fairytale characters leave what is familiar and go on \"The Million Princesses March\" to Flatbush (\" Gimme More \"). The group decides to camp for the night and create a list of wishes. Prince Erudite and Clumsy, allies who also joined the march, simultaneously wish for true love, and the princesses help the two get together. Unsure of where they are, Cinderella splits from the group in search of O.F.G. for direction. Alone in the woods, she runs into Prince Charming, who she rejects both verbally and physically (\"Cinderella (Reprise)\").\n\nThe Stepmother attempts yet again to get the Narrator to replace Cinderella with her daughters. Finally, the Narrator agrees. Once the Stepmother gets what she wants, she asks the Narrator to banish all the other fairytale characters to Story's End (\" Toxic \"). When Snow White will not give up Cinderella's location, he banishes her too. Hungry on power, he banishes the Stepmother's daughters. After the Narrator has left, Cinderella finds the Stepmother alone in shock and learns that the Narrator has banished everyone. Feeling hopeless and alone, Cinderella sings the musical's eleven o'clock number (\" Everytime \"). At the final line of this song, the little girl enters the stage with a broken fairytale book and begins singing along. Though Cinderella feels that she has broken her fairytale, the girl consoles her and tells her that she loves the new fairytale Cinderella has been leading since departing from her original story. Calling for the little girl, O.F.G. enters, and Cinderella realizes that O.F.G. is the little girl's godmother too. The three decide that they must all return to the palace and figure out if Cinderella lives happy ever after.\n\nBack at the palace, the Narrator offers Cinderella an ultimatum: marry Prince Charming or be banished to Story's End. Right before Prince Charming and Cinderella kiss, Cinderella defies the fairytale and breaks her glass slipper, making her own fairytale and freeing the other characters from Story's End (\" Stronger \"). After the little girl tells the Narrator that she likes change, the Narrator agrees to take input from the characters to create \"New Fairytales for a New Age.\" However, Cinderella demands the power for each character to write their own story and to find their own happy every after. As O.F.G. and the little girl leave to return home to Flatbush, O.F.G. reveals that she is Betty. The musical ends with each character holding a quill, with the possibility of having it all.",

The musical first appeared in 1992 as a studio recording featuring Lesley Garrett as Cathy , Dave Willetts as Heathcliff , Bonnie Langford as Isabella Linton and other stars of Britain's West End stage. The show has since been translated into six languages from the original English and has been extensively staged in the UK,  USA, The Netherlands,  Germany, Poland, Romania, Australia and New Zealand. In 2008 a production was being planned in Budapest, Hungary, where Taylor's Much Ado received its European continental premiere in 2007. Lesley Garrett has included her recording of 'I Belong To The Earth' on two of her solo albums.\n\nThe adaptation had the support of the Bronte Society at Haworth in Yorkshire, whose curator at the time, Dr. Juliet Barker ,  wrote: \"Various other attempts at adapting Wuthering Heights for the stage have been submitted to the Bronte Society in the past but Bernard Taylor's adaptation is the first that I have really approved of and would be prepared to support.\"\n\nMark Seaward, Editor of the Bronte Society's magazine, wrote: \" Wuthering Heights is an intensely dramatic work, charged with emotion; it is not surprising that many dramatists, choreographers, lyricists and composers have been drawn to recreate it for stage and screen. There have been seven major films between 1920 and 1991 and in addition there has been a ballet (1982), and opera (1967) and numerous adaptations and plays, including several for television \u2014 and not forgetting Kate Bush\u2019s song \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d which topped the charts! Bernard J. Taylor's work marks the first time that the true spirit and drama of Emily Bront\u00eb's masterpiece has been captured in a musical.\"\n\nThe summer, 1992 edition of Show Music Magazine, USA, reported: \"Bernard J. Taylor's big, sweepingly romantic score sustains a feeling of dark passion entirely appropriate for an adaptation of Emily Bronte's novel concerning the ill-fated love between Cathy and Heathcliff.\"",

It is based on the children's stories by Johnny Gruelle and the 1977 feature film Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure . The story centers on Marcella, a dying young girl whose toys come to life and take her on a magical adventure to meet the Doll Doctor, in hopes that he can mend her broken heart. Although the show failed on Broadway, it developed a cult following through bootleg recordings .",
        "synopsis": "The story, in the Broadway production, was as follows:\n\n### Act I\n\nYoung Marcella is suffering from psychological trauma. Her mother ran away with another man, which drove her father to drink. Her dog tried to eat her pet bird, which killed them both (\"Gingham and Yarn\"). In Marcella's bedroom, a trio of doctors give differing but equally dire warnings regarding the youngster's ailments until Poppa throws them out. Lightening the mood, Poppa presents her with a doll that he created, which he names Raggedy Ann. Marcella complains that she has no heart, so Poppa pulls a candy heart from a box and stitches it onto the doll. He sings his daughter a lullaby, claiming that her toys spring to life when she's asleep (\"Carry On\").\n\nMarcella's bed whirls around, and out from the covers pops Raggedy Ann. The girl says she's dying, and the trio of doctors emerge from beneath the mattress to corroborate her story (\"Diagnosis\"). Raggedy Ann shouts them off and urges Marcella to get out of bed, revealing that this is a dream, so she can do anything she wants. The rag dolly calls for help from her friends: Raggedy Andy, Baby, and Panda, who emerge from the toy box one by one (\"The Light\").\n\nAndy is curious as to what's behind the closet door, so he opens it despite Marcella's pleas. General D. emerges with his cronies, the sexy Bat and the roguish Wolf. He says that he's enlisting recruits for his Army of the Dead and thinks Raggedy Ann is the one he's looking for, but she argues that she's only \"Make Believe\". The General learns that Marcella is dying, so he declares that he'll be back to collect her at 6 a.m.\n\nSuddenly, Marcella and the toys find themselves at the Miami shipyard , where old toys go to die. The doctors appear and drop the Camel behind a chain-link fence (\"Diagnosis (Reprise)\"). The animal tells the toys that he's all alone and \"Blue\". Raggedy Ann suggests that they should head to Los Angeles to visit the Doll Doctor. Andy leads them in transforming the bed into a boat, and they set sail (\"Make Believe Reprise\").\n\nA giant hand sporting a thumb ring attempts to drag the boat down to Davy Jones' Locker , so the toys begin flapping the bed's blankets like wings and rise into the heavens (\"Something in the Air\"/\"So Beautiful\"). Along the way, Marcella reunites with her pet bird (\"A Heavenly Chorus\") and her parents (\"The Shooting Star\"). The Rat in the Rolls-Royce , representing the man her mother ran away with, jumps out to steal Mommy away, so Poppa punches him out, and the couple agree to remarry (\"The Wedding\"). Marcella says that she's tired of pointless stories and walks off, which fills Raggedy Ann with self-doubt, though the rag doll refuses to give up (\"Rag Dolly\"). Bat gnaws through the rope tethering them to the clouds, and the boat plunges from the sky.\n\n### Act II\n\nMarcella and the dolls land on the roof of a meatpacking plant in Omaha and have only four hours left to get to the Doll Doctor. Bat talks Raggedy Andy into handing over the map (\"You'll Love It\").\n\nGeneral D. arrives and commands Marcella to look at his opal thumb ring. He states his intention to make Marcella his queen. The toys lull the General and his cronies to sleep (\"Would You Like a Little Music?\") and steal the ring. The melody fills the Camel with such spirit that he's able to soar on the wings of the song, so everyone grabs on, and they float away. The General awakens and orders Bat to follow them, but Bat refuses, so the General throws her down a chimney and sends Wolf to find the dolls instead.\n\nThe toys find themselves separated in the Grisley Woods National Park and frantically search for one another through a maze of trees littered with skeletons with glowing red eyes (\"Gone\"). They meet the Witch, dressed like a 1920s flapper (\"Why Not?\"). The Witch pulls a bundle of clothesline from her bag and tries to fashion a noose . Raggedy Ann tells the Witch that it's a terrible idea to kill herself, and the Witch reflects on the life that she gave up (\"What Did I Lose\"/\"Somewhere\"). The Witch reveals that she had a daughter named Marcella and comes to realize that the young lady standing before her is her child. They have a tearful reunion, which is interrupted by the arrival of Wolf. Bitter toward his master for killing Bat, he allows Marcella to escape but pursues the Witch into the woods.\n\nThe toys arrive at the Doll Hospital (\"Welcome to L.A.\"), but the doctors are revealed to be the same \"quacks\" as before (\"Diagnosis (Reprise)\") and tell them the Doll Doctor is dead. Panda suggests looking into the ring, where they see the head doctor alive and chained up. General D. emerges from the cellar and declares that this is his field hospital for the terminally wounded (\"I Come Riding\"). He becomes curious about the heart on Raggedy Ann's apron, but upon touching it, he collapses, crying that he's been poisoned by love. They tie up the General, swipe his keys, and head downstairs. He vows that he'll get loose.\n\nIn the dungeon, the Doll Doctor examines Marcella, declaring that the \"chick\" has a broken heart. Upon hearing her father's pet name for her, Marcella realizes that the Doll Doctor is actually Poppa. Poppa says that a heart transplant is the only thing that can save her, but those haven't been invented yet, so he suggests a candy heart. Just as the General bursts in to collect Marcella, Raggedy Ann sacrifices her own candy heart, which she coerces the girl to eat (\"The Light (Reprise)\"). Raggedy Ann then leaves with the General, who is satisfied he was right all along.\n\nBack in her bedroom, a now-healthy Marcella tells Poppa of her adventure, and he offers to sew a new heart on Raggedy Ann's chest (\"Gingham and Yarn Reprise\").",

The production was directed by Carolyn Cantor.\n\nThe show, described as a 'darkly comic rock-fable', is set largely in 1965 New York at the time of the northeast blackout , and centres around a love triangle between a sandwich maker and two sisters.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nThe Narrator introduces the story by describing the death of Cecily Smith, Mr McClam's wife and Harold's mother, on November 9, 1964 (\"Fly By Night\"). After the funeral, Harold and his father clean out Cecily's closet and find a record of La Traviata and a guitar. Mr McClam attempts to tell his son about why the record is important to him; however, Harold is fixated on the guitar, which Mr McClam lets him keep.\n\nThe Narrator jumps forward five months to a 'smoky club', where Harold performs a song (\"Circles in the Sand\") using his mother's old guitar. The Narrator cuts Harold off mid-song when he realises he has skipped a large part of the story.\n\nThe Narrator then takes the audience back in time to introduce Daphne, a young woman living in South Dakota who dreams of moving to New York and becoming an actress. Her mother agrees to let her pursue her dreams providing she takes her sister Miriam with her, and although Miriam is initially reluctant to leave her home, Daphne manages to convince her, and the two set off for New York (\"Daphne Dreams\"). Daphne is forced to take a job at a coat and shoe store while attending auditions, none of which are successful. One of these auditions is with the playwright Joey Storms, whose script she describes as 'worse than garbage' after being insulted by the producer.\n\nShortly after this audition, Daphne meets Harold, who is working as a sandwich maker at a deli run by the grumpy Crabble, and he makes her lunch. A few weeks later, he asks her out, and they kiss (\"More Than Just a Friend\").\n\nThe Narrator once again disrupts the chronology, taking the audience back in time to show Miriam on the night before she and Daphne leave for New York. Nervous about moving, Miriam finds comfort looking up at the stars, which she associates with her dead father (\"Stars I Trust\"). On Miriam's first night in New York, she has an unsettling encounter with a Romani fortune teller, which reinforces her worries about living in the city. However, she becomes more optimistic when she gets her dream job: waitressing at the Greasy Spoon Caf\u00e9, a 24-hour diner in Brooklyn (\"Breakfast All Day\").\n\nThe Narrator takes the audience forward to New Year's Day , 1965, when the playwright Joey Storms enters Daphne's store and declares her his muse (\"What You Do To Me\"). He begs her to star in his new show, entitled 'The Human Condition'. Daphne is ecstatic and goes to the deli to tell Harold her news. He proposes to her and she says yes (\"More Than Just a Friend (Reprise)\"), and decides that Harold and Miriam should meet.\n\nThat night, Miriam gets lost on her way to the diner and runs into the fortune teller again (\"The Prophecy\"). They say that Miriam will meet her soulmate that night, and tell her of three signs: the question \"What does it look like when time stops?\"; the numbers five, two, and seven; and a mysterious melody. Miriam goes to the diner and sees that the only person there is Harold. The two hit it off and Miriam sings the fortune teller's melody for Harold, who realises it is the perfect fit for the song he has been writing. Miriam is amazed by this and tells Harold everything about the prophecy , announcing \"You're my soulmate, I think\". When Daphne enters and introduces Harold to Miriam as her fianc\u00e9, Miriam is mortified.\n\nThe fortune teller later finds Miriam and warns her that there is a second part to the prophecy: she will have a love affair with her soulmate, and then she will have a great fall (\"The Prophecy Part 2\").\n\nAlthough Miriam vows to avoid Harold, he can't stop thinking about her. He writes a song for her and performs it at the 'smoky club' The Narrator showed the audience earlier, tricking Miriam into attending by telling her that the wedding band Daphne asked her to book is playing there that night. This time, The Narrator allows the scene to complete and Harold finishes his song (\"Circles in the Sand (Reprise)\"). Afterwards, he finds Miriam in the crowd, and they kiss.\n\n### Act 2\n\nMiriam is filled with guilt over kissing her sister's fianc\u00e9 and flees to South Dakota (\"Pulled Apart\"). With Miriam gone, Harold falls into a state of depression . He and Daphne move in together, however they rarely see each other as she spends so much time rehearsing with Joey. Mr McClam calls his son repeatedly, however Harold can't bring himself to answer the phone. At work, Harold and Crabble complain about the state of their lives (\"Eternity\").\n\nThe opening night of Joey's play is set for November 9, 1965. On 'Opening Eve', he presents Daphne with a new song (\"I Need More\") which references her acting dreams and her strained relationship with Harold. That night, both Daphne and Harold dream of escaping their empty lives (\"The Rut\").\n\nThe next morning, Harold's alarm clock breaks and he sees it as a sign: \"this is what it looks like when time stops!\". He books a train ticket to South Dakota to find Miriam. As he waits for his train, The Narrator talks us through the activities of the other characters: Mr McClam wants to mark the anniversary of his wife's death by seeing La Traviata , but the show is sold out; Daphne and Joey prepare for opening night; and Crabble, alone at the deli, tries to make as many sandwiches as possible (\"At Least I'll Know I Tried\").\n\nHarold is about to board his train when he spots Miriam, who has returned to New York to see Daphne's play. She explains why she can't be with him, but he convinces her to have one lunch with him (\"Me With You\"). This lunch lasts for hours, and as they are about to part ways, the northeast blackout hits and the lights go out.\n\nMr McClam, who was about to take his own life by dropping his record player into his bath, believes that his wife sent the blackout to save him. He goes outside and tells a small crowd of neighbours the story of how he met his wife, and the significance of La Traviata (\"Cecily Smith\").\n\nMeanwhile, the blackout - which struck just as the curtain was about to rise on the play - causes Joey to have an epiphany, and he decides he needs to leave New York. He asks Daphne to come with him, but she refuses as living in New York is her dream.\n\nHarold and Miriam, caught up in the romance of the blackout, decide to run away; however, Miriam looks up at a clock and sees that the time stopped at 5:27. She stops in her tracks, remembering the prophecy, and is hit by a speeding car. At the hospital, Daphne and Harold learn that she has died (\"Fly By Night (Reprise)\").\n\nGrief-stricken, Harold spends hours wandering around the dark city, eventually finding himself on his childhood stoop, where he is comforted by his father. He goes to his apartment, where Daphne sings 'Stars I Trust' on the roof. Together, they look at the sky and mourn Miriam (\"November Stars\").",

Combined run was 1,143 performances.  It was seen briefly in a West End production in 1962 and has become a popular show for amateur and semi-professional groups in the United States and elsewhere.",
        "synopsis": "Time: Early in \"this\" century i.e., the 20th century Place: The Colorado Inn (shades of the White Horse Inn), high in the Rocky Mountains (standing in for the Tyrol )\n\nLittle Mary Sunshine, foster daughter of Chief Brown Bear of the Kadota tribe, is in trouble.  The government is threatening to foreclose the mortgage on her Colorado Inn, located on land that is subject to a dispute between Brown Bear and Uncle Sam. On Mary's advice Brown Bear is engaged in peaceful legal proceedings rather than warfare to establish his rights.\n\nCaptain Jim and his Forest Rangers arrive.  They are searching for the disruptive Indian Yellow Feather. Yellow Feather's \"crimes\" are actually not murder and pillage but indiscriminate hunting and irresponsible use of fire in the forest, but he is nonetheless a villain of the deepest dye, who has threatened to \"have his way\" with Mary.  Jim woos Mary, after which the two get well-sung advice from Mary's opera star guest Mme. Ernestine Liebedich.\n\nSome young ladies from the Eastchester Finishing School (implicitly in New York or Pennsylvania, which have Westchesters) are also Inn guests.  While they entertain themselves playing croquet and swinging on swings, the Rangers come upon them.  The Rangers' flirting elicits an immediate enthusiastic response, and love blooms once more as they joyfully sing together.\n\nLater, the young ranger Billy and his girlfriend Nancy squabble about Nancy's appetite for other men.  Jim and Mary return to the spotlight.  Mary reveals her \" Little Buttercup \" secret: Yellow Feather is really Brown Bear's son, long believed dead. As the first act ends, Jim and his aged Indian guide Fleet Foot set off to capture Yellow Feather.\n\nMary holds a garden party featuring the Eastchester ladies and the Rangers.  Retired General Oscar Fairfax shows up, bringing a box of gifts for the ladies.  Taking command of the Rangers in Jim's absence, he directs the Rangers to depart, find Jim, and bring him back.  Fairfax now has the ladies to himself.  But his interest shifts to Mme. Ernestine when he meets her and learns they have something in common: in their youth, both spent happy days in Vienna .\n\nMary goes to her garden.  Yellow Feather sneaks in, finds her there, ties her to a tree, and threatens to debase her.  Jim returns just in time and wrests a knife from the villain.  The Rangers, who have surrounded the Inn, capture Yellow Feather as he tries to escape.\n\nThe rest of the cast then emerges.  Fairfax has good news: the courts have upheld Brown Bear's claim to the disputed land, a mere one-fourth of Colorado.  The chief gives Mary the Inn's land and dedicates the rest for a national park, a place the Rangers can call home.  In the finale, a miraculously reformed Yellow Feather reappears, waving a large American flag.  Jim and Mary, Billy and Nancy, Oscar and Ernestine, and several Ranger-Eastchester couples seem headed for the altar.",

        "synopsis": "Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, seeking adventure and superstition, skip school to attempt resurrecting a dead cat through an incantation they believe will be empowered by the imminent death of a man named Hoss Williams. During their escapade, they encounter Muff Potter, the town drunk. Their discussion is interrupted by Injun Joe , who informs them that Doc Robinson seeks their assistance to exhume Williams' body. Concurrently, Tom consistently evades school, weaving elaborate tales to excuse his absences at dinner. When Aunt Polly, his guardian, seeks to discipline him for his truancy, Tom cunningly persuades other children to undertake his punitive chores, demonstrating his mischievous and manipulative nature.\n\nFollowing Williams' death, Tom and Huck visit the cemetery, only to discover Muff Potter and Injun Joe exhuming Williams' grave under Doc Robinson's orders. An altercation ensues when Joe demands additional payment, and in the ensuing chaos, Robinson inadvertently incapacitates Muff with a shovel. In a violent response, Joe strikes Robinson, knocking him into the grave, then fatally stabs him with Muff's knife. Horrified, Tom and Huck witness the entire event and flee the scene, binding themselves with a pact of silence over the gruesome murder they observed.\n\nIn the aftermath of the murder, Injun Joe deceitfully accuses Muff Potter of the crime, resulting in Muff's imprisonment. Concurrently, Tom Sawyer becomes infatuated with the newly arrived Becky Thatcher . During Muff's trial, as Injun Joe testifies with false claims, Tom, unable to bear the injustice, courageously reveals the true series of events on the stand, carefully omitting Huck's presence. In a dramatic turn, Injun Joe retaliates by hurling a knife at Tom, narrowly missing him, and then makes a daring escape through the courthouse window.\n\nPost-trial, Tom and Becky's brief \"engagement\" dissolves when Becky learns of Tom's prior commitment to Amy Lawrence. Distraught, Tom finds himself at odds with Huck for violating their pact of secrecy. The boys, seeking escape and adventure, decide to run away together, journeying down the Mississippi River. Their expedition takes a perilous turn when a riverboat capsizes their raft, stranding them on an island. As they revel in their newfound freedom, they speculate about Injun Joe's fate. During their island sojourn, they observe a group conducting a river dragging, a technique involving cannon fire aimed to recover bodies submerged in the river.\n\nTom and Huck, yearning for home, return only to discover their own funeral in progress, presumed dead by the townsfolk. Their sudden appearance joyously interrupts the service, leading to a warm reception. Subsequently, the Widow Douglas adopts Huck, endeavoring to civilize him. During a subsequent Independence Day celebration, Tom and Becky's exploration of McDougal's Cave turns perilous when they encounter Injun Joe. A harrowing chase ensues, culminating in a dramatic confrontation with Judge Thatcher, Muff, and Huck. In the chaos, Muff throws a torch at Injun Joe, causing him to fall to his demise.\n\nSome time after the tumultuous events, Huck vanishes, causing concern for the Widow Douglas. Tom, upon locating him at their favored fishing spot, chides Huck for his thoughtlessness. As Huck ponders his future, possibly setting the stage for his own adventures in Huckleberry Finn , Tom returns to find Muff Potter preparing to leave town, hinting at a possible future reunion. Concurrently, Judge Thatcher arranges a two-week trip to St. Louis for Tom and Becky, offering a reprieve from recent events. Before departing, Tom mends relationships with his family and commits to personal improvement.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nJenna is a waitress and expert pie baker at Joe's Pie Diner in the American South. She bakes pies to distract herself from her unhappiness with her home life (\"What's Inside\"). She begins another day at the diner with her boss Cal and fellow waitresses Becky and Dawn (\"Opening Up\"). After Jenna almost throws up, Becky and Dawn convince her to take a pregnancy test which, to Jenna's dismay, comes back positive; Jenna deduces the pregnancy came from a night when she drunkenly had sex with her abusive husband, Earl (\"The Negative\"). Earl comes to the diner and suggests he wants to make Jenna quit and give up her passion for baking. He takes the tips she has earned from working so far that day. She decides not to tell him about her pregnancy and recalls her late mother, who also found solace from an unhappy marriage in baking (\"What Baking Can Do\").\n\nAt her OB/GYN's office, Jenna is taunted by other pregnant women (\"Club Knocked Up\") and meets Dr. James \"Jim\" Pomatter, a new doctor from Connecticut . Jenna explains she does not want to raise a child but does not want an abortion , and leaves Dr. Pomatter with a Mermaid Marshmallow pie, which he eats and loves (\"Pomatter Pie\").\n\nWord of Jenna's pregnancy reaches Joe, the diner's elderly owner, who suggests she enter a local pie-baking contest with a cash prize of $20,000, which would give Jenna enough money to leave Earl. Dawn begins using an online dating platform but is terrified of every outcome (\"When He Sees Me\").\n\nJenna runs into Dr. Pomatter at the bus stop. He tells her he loved the Mermaid Marshmallow pie, saying it could \"win contests and ribbons and things\" (\"It Only Takes a Taste\"). Jenna arrives home to learn Earl has been fired from his job. He berates her, and his anger almost turns physical; out of impulse and fear, Jenna confesses she is pregnant. Earl softens up, but makes Jenna promise not to love the baby more than she loves him (\"You Will Still Be Mine\"). Jenna tells Dawn and Becky of her plan to enter the pie contest; if she wins, she will use the prize money to leave Earl and raise the baby herself. The three waitresses see their dreams of a better life within reach (\"A Soft Place to Land\"). Jenna begins to give Earl only half her earnings, hiding the other half around the house in order to save up for entering the pie contest.\n\nDawn's date, Ogie, visits the diner. Dawn believes that their first date did not go well, but Ogie insists on finding out more about Dawn and helping her overcome her anxiety (\"Never Ever Getting Rid of Me\"). Dawn and Ogie realize how much they have in common, such as their mutual enjoyment of American Revolution reenactments. Jenna makes an appointment with Dr. Pomatter, where he comes in two hours early just to see her again. Jenna confronts Dr. Pomatter, accusing him of being strange, but then she impulsively kisses him. Though both are married, they decide to escape their frustrating lives, and have sex in his office (\"Bad Idea\").\n\n### Act II\n\nAfter her tryst, Jenna discovers Becky and Cal making out at the diner. The married Becky is unashamed of giving in to passion (\"I Didn't Plan It\"). Jenna and Dr. Pomatter continue their affair, as do Becky and Cal; Dawn and Ogie begin their relationship (\"Bad Idea (Reprise)\"). Jenna wonders if having an affair is a mistake, but Dr. Pomatter reassures her. Jenna begins writing a letter to her baby (\"You Matter to Me\").\n\nAfter happily dating for several months, Dawn and Ogie get married at the diner (\"I Love You Like a Table\"). Jenna arrives with a tiered pie resembling a wedding cake . At the reception, Jenna asks if Cal, despite his affair, is truly happy; he responds that he is \"happy enough.\" Joe tells Jenna his sincere hopes for her (\"Take It from an Old Man\"). Earl drags Jenna home and uncovers the money she has been hiding. She meekly tells him she has been saving for the baby, but Earl leaves with the money. Jenna breaks down, lamenting her long-lost control over her life (\" She Used to Be Mine \").\n\nJenna goes into labor (\"Contraction Ballet\"). She sees Joe at the hospital on his way to surgery. Joe gives Jenna an envelope, and tells her not to open it until she leaves the hospital. Earl, Becky and Dawn, and even Dr. Pomatter's wife, who is a resident at the hospital, crowd the delivery room. Jenna cries out in distress and gives birth. She names her daughter Lulu. Earl reminds Jenna of her promise not to love Lulu more than him, and Jenna finally tells him she wants a divorce. He reacts poorly, and she implies she will seek a restraining order against him if he ever comes near her or Lulu. Dr. Pomatter visits Jenna alone in her room, but Jenna refuses his kiss. Saying she does not want to remain \"happy enough\", she ends the affair. As thanks for his positive impact on her life, she gives him a moon pie . Jenna remarks on her change in outlook with Lulu in her life (\"Everything Changes\").\n\nJenna opens Joe's envelope. Knowing he was dying, he left her the diner in his will and testament ; Joe also wanted Jenna to \"name a pie after me when I'm gone\". Five years later, the diner has been rechristened \"Lulu's Pies\" and Jenna, the owner and head chef, is content that her life has finally turned around (\"Opening Up (Finale)\").",

As he grows up, Bruce vows to seek out and destroy evil so that what happened to him will never happen again, deciding to dress up as a giant bat and fight crime as the masked vigilante \"Batman\" (\"Holy Musical B@man!\"). Batman is universally loved by the citizens of Gotham City for being a dark and angsty anti-hero . This is despite the fact that Batman irrationally hates them all, holding the people of Gotham responsible for letting his parents die and considering them all (potential) criminals. After a final battle with his nemesis, The Joker , in which the villain falls to his death, Batman partakes in a ceremony to receive the key to the city from Commissioner Gordon , but clashes with Superman , a superhero from Metropolis who constantly upstages Batman. After leaving the ceremony in a huff and arriving home, Batman comes to the realization that he doesn't have any real friends, and fires his loyal butler Alfred after he discovers that he was pretending to be Lucius Fox . Alfred immediately returns disguised as \"O'Malley, the Irish butler\" and both he and Batman lament (\"Dark, Sad, Lonely, Knight\"). Superman, also feeling lonely due to his lack of popularity, calls Batman and leaves an apologetic voicemail, inviting him to an upcoming battle with Solomon Grundy that he's trying to organize with other heroes.\n\nThe Council of Rogues, a group of Gotham's most famous super-villains - The Penguin , Catwoman , Poison Ivy , Scarecrow , Mr. Freeze and the Riddler - meet to discuss how Batman is foiling all of their crimes (\"Rogues Are We\"). After a brief interruption from Two-Face , who is promptly refused membership on the council by the other annoyed villains, Sweet Tooth, the newest villain in town, arrives and swiftly seizes control of the Rogues. He then hatches a plan to rouse every villain in Gotham, no matter how lame or derivative, and kill Batman by overwhelming him with sheer numbers (\"Rogues Are We (Reprise)\"). Batman is crying in his room when Alfred introduces him to a visitor: the orphaned acrobat Dick Grayson . Batman and Dick realize they have a lot in common and quickly strike up a friendship. Bruce reveals his secret identity as Batman, to which Dick reveals that he wishes to become his sidekick, Robin . Together they set out and take on the hordes of new villains plaguing Gotham, both happier than they have ever been. (\"Dynamic Duet\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe citizens of Gotham react badly to Robin, feeling that his wisecracking and light-hearted antics detract from Batman's image as a lone, dark anti-hero (\"Robin Sucks\"). Meanwhile, Superman grows even more jealous of Batman and his new friendship after no-one showed up to his Solomon Grundy battle. \"O'Malley\" tells Batman he agrees with Gotham's opinion on Robin and Batman fires him; he returns yet again as \"Kwan Lee, the Chinese butler\". While rescuing Rachel Dawes, Robin is captured by Sweet Tooth and his new accomplice and lover, Candy, who also take three thousand people hostage in Gotham Square. Sweet Tooth then sets up a Facebook poll, letting the people of Gotham decide whether he kills Robin or poisons the water supply with a lethally-sour Warhead in seven hours. Seeing Batman torn between saving Gotham or Robin, Alfred \"returns\" and comforts him. Batman, believing that Gotham will choose to sacrifice Robin to save themselves, decides to rescue Robin and let Gotham City suffer the consequences. In response to this, President Barack Obama enlists Superman to defeat Batman before he can rescue Robin and doom the citizens of Gotham (\"The American Way\").\n\nBatman breaks through Sweet Tooth's barricade around Gotham Square and confronts the supervillain, who flees with Robin. Batman's pursuit is interrupted by Superman, and the two heroes fight each other (\"To Be A Man\"). Superman dominates the fight until Batman brings out a chunk of Kryptonite , weakening Superman and leaving him lying powerless in the street. Batman corners Sweet Tooth, but the villain attempts to throw Robin into a vat of boiling hot chocolate. Batman saves Robin and lets Sweet Tooth fall into the vat instead, but not before Sweet Tooth activates the Warhead launch and successfully poisons the water supply. Robin is appalled that Batman would leave Gotham City to die, and after checking the Facebook poll, it is revealed that the people of Gotham chose to sacrifice themselves instead of killing Robin.\n\nRealizing that he can believe in the people of Gotham City after all, Batman puts aside his pride and calls on Superman to save the day, mending the rift between them. Superman travels back in time by flying around the world until he reverses the rotation of the Earth , which allows him to intercept the Warhead before it can be deployed and throw it into the Sun. With their new friendship established, Superman and Batman form the Super Friends with various other superheroes (\"Super Friends\"), including Green Lantern , members of the Justice League and Spider-Man .",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nGrace O\u2019Malley, the eighteen-year-old daughter of Dubhdara, Chieftain of the O\u2019Malley clan, and her childhood sweetheart Tiernan sneak aboard the newly christened ship The Pirate Queen (\"Prologue\"). Grace tells her father she wants to be a sailor, but Dubhdara tells her it is impossible, as it is considered unlucky to have a woman on board a ship. Grace expresses her frustration to Tiernan (\"Woman\").\n\nGrace disguises herself as a cabin boy and stows away. When one of the ship's spars breaks in a storm, Grace climbs the rigging to cut the mainsail free. The sailors cheer the \"boy's\" bravery, but are shocked to learn his true identity. Dubhdara is furious, but appreciates Grace's heroism, so he allows her to join the ship's crew. Since her mother's death, Grace has been Dubhdara's only family. Though he loves her deeply, he realises that he barely knows the passionate woman she has become (\"My Grace\"). Tiernan is overjoyed that the woman he loves will be allowed to stay on the ship. Although their relationship must be kept secret, they swear themselves to each other (\"Here on This Night\").\n\nDuring a battle with an English vessel, Dubhdara is wounded and Grace instinctively takes charge. Though outnumbered, they defeat the English soldiers and sink the warship. Seeing what his daughter has done, Dubhdara decides to defy tradition and train her to be a sea captain like himself. Several years pass.\n\nIn 1558, Henry VIII's successor, Mary Tudor , dies suddenly, and Elizabeth I ascends to the throne (\"The Waking of the Queen\"). Elizabeth summons her court, and shows her condescending ministers how forceful she intends to be as Queen (\"Rah-Rah, Tip-Top\"). The Queen names her royal advisor Sir Richard Bingham the Lord Governor of Ireland, with instructions to quell the Irish rebellion and kill Grace O'Malley.\n\nThe increased aggression from England forces the Irish clans to take drastic measures. Dubhdara summons the chieftain of his clan's ancient rival, the Clan O\u2019Flaherty, to a meeting in which he proposes that they arrange a marriage between Grace, and O\u2019Flaherty's son, Donal. When the marriage produces a son, the clans will be united. Grace is horrified, since she loves Tiernan, yet she knows the necessity for such a political act and agrees (\"The Choice Is Mine\"). Donal vows that he will tame this Pirate Queen (\"Boys\u2019ll Be Boys\"). The next day, the two clan leaders preside over \"The Wedding\". Tiernan watches, devastated, yet senses that Grace will need him one day and he decides to stay near her (\"I\u2019ll Be There\").\n\nThe English set a trap for Grace. They land in the small town of Belclare and the men take up arms, leaving Grace and the women behind. With the town deserted except for \"helpless females,\" Grace mobilizes the women and they kill the invaders. Only Bingham is left alive, with instructions to tell the Queen \"he was bested by a woman.\"\n\nTiernan arrives with news that Dubhdara is dying. Grace races off to Clew Bay, and Clan O\u2019Flaherty goes with her (\"A Day Beyond Belclare\"). Donal expects that his marriage to Grace will make him the chieftain of both clans, but Dubhdara, however, passes the chieftain's ring and mantle to Grace, making her the first woman ever to become leader of a clan. Dubhdara dies, and the clan gives him a sailor's funeral, in a flaming boat set out to sea (\"Sail to the Stars\").\n\n### Act II\n\nGrace, once again captain of The Pirate Queen , gives birth aboard ship (\"It's a Boy\"). The Pirate Queen is attacked by the English and Grace, despite having just given birth, joins the fight (\"Enemy at Port Side\"). The Irish prevail, at considerable cost, but Grace can only think of Donal's cowardice. According to Irish law, a marriage becomes permanent only after three years. Grace invokes this law and banishes Donal from her life (\"I Dismiss You\"). Once again, Grace and Tiernan are free to be together (\"If I Said I Loved You\").\n\nIn England, Elizabeth faces a complex dilemma. As Queen, her most important obligation is to produce an heir (\"The Role of the Queen\"). When Donal arrives at the christening of his son Eoin (\"The Christening/Let a Father Stand By His Son\"), Bingham and his English troops burst into the ceremony, killing many of the O\u2019Malley clan and taking Grace prisoner. Donal and Tiernan engage in violent battle, during which Donal is killed. Tiernan takes the child to safety.\n\nGrace is imprisoned for seven years, during which time Bingham completes his conquest of Ireland. Tiernan offers himself in exchange for Grace, so that she can return to her child (\"Surrender\"). To everyone's amazement, Elizabeth accepts Tiernan's offer and releases Grace (\"She Who Has All\").\n\nGrace returns to find Ireland despoiled by Bingham's marauding English troops. Reunited with her son and seeing the Ireland Eoin will now inherit, Grace sets sail for England to plead the case for Ireland (\"The Sea of Life\"). Elizabeth is enraged at Grace's return, but Grace appeals to Elizabeth woman to woman, urging the Queen not to ignore her nature but to use it to rule wisely. After a two hour long discussion, Elizabeth restores Grace's lands and ships and releases Tiernan from prison (\"Woman to Woman\").\n\nGrace and Tiernan return to Ireland where they are reunited with Eoin. At last they marry, and the Irish people celebrate with a plea for Ireland to be once and forever at peace (\"Finale\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe Narrator introduces the main characters in the story. Cinderella wishes to attend a festival held by the king, much to the dismay of her Stepmother and Stepsisters. Jack wishes his cow, Milky White, would give milk, and his Mother wishes that Jack would sell Milky White. A Baker and his Wife wish to have a child, and Little Red Riding Hood wishes for bread to bring to her ill Grandmother. Little Red obtains bread from the Baker, who then is visited by a neighbor, an ugly old Witch. She reveals that the Baker and his Wife cannot have children because, when the Baker's father stole vegetables from her garden, she cursed his family tree to \"be a barren one\" and took the couple's other child, Rapunzel . If the Witch is brought four items \u2013 \"the cow as white as milk, the cape as red as blood, the hair as yellow as corn, and the slipper as pure as gold\" \u2013 in three days time, she will lift the curse. All begin their journey into the woods. Jack to sell Milky White, Cinderella to visit her mother's grave after her family left for the festival without her, Little Red to visit her Grandmother, and the Baker \u2013 refusing his wife's help \u2013 to find the ingredients (\"Into the Woods\").\n\nCinderella receives a gown and golden slippers from her mother's spirit (\"Cinderella at the Grave\"). A Mysterious Man mocks Jack for valuing his cow more than a \"sack of beans\". Little Red meets a hungry Wolf who intends to eat her (\"Hello, Little Girl\"), which The Baker sees, and notices her cape. His Wife follows him; they meet Jack and convince him to trade Milky White for beans found in the Baker's jacket after lying and saying they're magic. Jack bids a tearful goodbye to Milky White (\"I Guess This Is Goodbye\"). The Baker regrets lying, but his Wife reassures him (\"Maybe They're Magic\").\n\nThe Witch has raised Rapunzel in a tall tower accessible only by climbing Rapunzel's long, golden hair (\"Our Little World\"), and a Prince spies Rapunzel, falling in love. Little Red and her Grandmother are eaten by the Wolf, but the Baker, in pursuit of the cape, saves them and kills the wolf. To thank the Baker, Little Red gifts him the cape (\"I Know Things Now\"). Jack returns to his Mother with the beans, which she angrily throws on the ground. After attending the festival, Cinderella flees from a Prince who has fallen in love with her. She meets the Baker's Wife who helps her hide (\"A Very Nice Prince\"). The Baker's Wife tries to grab one of Cinderella's slippers, but loses Milky White. As the day ends, the characters recall their morals from the day (\"First Midnight\").\n\nJack describes his adventure climbing a beanstalk the beans sprouted and meeting a giant couple (\"Giants in The Sky\"). Having stolen money from the giants, he tries to buy Milky White back, though the Baker refuses. After Jack returns up the beanstalk to get more treasure, the Mysterious Man takes the money from the Baker. Cinderella's and Rapunzel's Princes, who are brothers, compare their maidens (\"Agony\"). The Baker's Wife, hearing of a girl with golden hair, finds Rapunzel, fools her into letting down her hair, and plucks some strands. The Mysterious Man finds Milky White and returns her to the Baker, and the Baker's Wife again fails to take Cinderella's slippers. The Baker admits they must work together (\"It Takes Two\"). Jack arrives with a hen that lays golden eggs, but Milky White keels over dead as midnight chimes (\"Second Midnight\").\n\nThe Witch discovers the Prince's visits to Rapunzel and demands she stay sheltered from the world. Rapunzel refuses, and the Witch cuts off her hair and banishes her to a remote desert (\"Stay with Me\"). The Mysterious Man gives the Baker money to buy another cow. Jack meets Little Red, now sporting a cape made from the wolf skin, and she goads him into stealing more from the giants. Torn between staying with her Prince or escaping, Cinderella leaves him a slipper as a clue (\"On the Steps of the Palace\") and trades shoes with the Baker's Wife. The Baker buys a new cow, and the two find the Witch.\n\nWith a loud crash, Jack's Mother runs in crying over a dead giant in her backyard, but is brushed off by the group. The Witch discovers that the cow is not Milky White, but an ordinary cow covered with flour, but is able to resurrect Milky White. When no milk is produced, she is angered when discovering the hair is Rapunzel's. The Mysterious Man suggests using corn silk instead, which works. The Witch reveals the Mysterious Man is the Baker's father, and drinks the potion. The curse is broken, the Mysterious Man falls dead, and the Witch regains her youth and beauty.\n\nCinderella's Prince looks for Cinderella. Her Stepmother forces her stepsisters to mutilate their feet to fit in the shoe, then hesitantly brings Cinderella to put on the shoe. It fits perfectly, and the two are reunited (\"Careful My Toe\"). Rapunzel bears twins and finds her Prince in the desert. When Rapunzel refuses to return to her, the Witch finds her powers were lost when the curse was broken. At Cinderella's wedding to her Prince, the Baker's Wife thanks Cinderella for her help. As the cast celebrates living \"happily ever after\", nobody notices another beanstalk growing (\"Ever After\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe narrator returns, reintroducing the cast, who have new wishes. The Baker's Wife wishes their house was bigger, but the Baker refuses to move out of his father's home. Jack misses the kingdom in the sky, and Cinderella is bored with her new life. With a loud crash, the Baker's house and the Witch's garden are destroyed (\"So Happy\"). The Baker goes to the castle to warn Cinderella, but is escorted out by the Steward. Little Red's house is also destroyed, and the Baker and his Wife offer to escort her to her Grandmother's home. Jack, hearing of the destruction from the Baker, goes to the woods to slay the giant, and Cinderella disguises herself to investigate the destruction of her mother's grave (\"Into the Woods (Reprise)\").\n\nRapunzel, driven mad by her long confinement, also flees to the woods. Her Prince follows her and meets his brother, and the two confess their lust for new women, Snow White and Sleeping Beauty (\"Agony (Reprise)\"). The group meet an angry Giantess, who demands Jack's whereabouts, saying he killed her husband (the giant who landed in Jack's yard). The Narrator is found by the group, and the Witch offers him up to the Giantess, but she drops and kills him. Jack's Mother arrives and defends her son, but the Steward kills her in a panic to protect the group. Rapunzel flees from the Witch, but is trampled by the Giantess. The Witch mourns Rapunzel (\"Witch's Lament\").\n\nThe Royal Family and Steward flee. The Witch vows to find Jack and offer him to the Giantess, so the Baker and his Wife split up to find him first, leaving Little Red with their son. Cinderella's Prince, searching for Cinderella, meets the Baker's Wife and seduces her (\"Any Moment\"). Meanwhile, the Baker finds Cinderella and convinces her to join him. The Baker's Wife is conflicted over her affair (\"Moments In The Woods\"), but before she can return to the Baker, she is trampled by the Giantess. The Witch finds Jack crying over the Baker's Wife's corpse and brings him to Cinderella, Little Red, and the Baker, informing them of her death. The group all blame each other for her death, before turning on the Witch (\"Your Fault\"). The Witch laments the group's impending doom and mocks them for not taking responsibility, then throws away the remaining beans and vanishes (\"Last Midnight\").\n\nStricken by grief, the Baker decides to abandon his son and leave. The Mysterious Man returns in spirit, pleading that the Baker not make the same mistakes he made; the Baker stays (\"No More\"). Cinderella discovers her Prince's infidelity and asks him to leave her alone. Little Red mourns her Grandmother after discovering she was killed by the Giantess, and is comforted by Cinderella. Meanwhile, the Baker informs Jack of his mother's death (\" No One Is Alone \").\n\nAfter slaying the Giantess, Jack, Little Red, Cinderella, and the Baker begin their journey back to the village. The Princes return with their new princesses, as do the spirits of the Royal Family, who starved to death. The Baker doubts his abilities to be a parent on his own, and his Wife's spirit returns to comfort him. She asks him to tell their story, and the Baker does so (reciting the same line the narrator says at the beginning of Act I). The Witch returns and warns the audience to be careful of their wishes or stories told to children, and the group leaves the woods (\"Children Will Listen\").",

The DJ instructs the clubbers to enjoy the party as they watch the club's staff reenact the life of Imelda Marcos. The club ensemble enters, singing about the excess of wealth demonstrated by Americans, and conversely how some may find that display desirable (\"American Troglodyte\").\n\nImelda Romualdez is shown as a poor girl in stormy Leyte with best friend Estrella Cumpas and expresses her dreams of joining the upper class (\"Here Lies Love\"). Ninoy Aquino appears and describes his life as a son of a rich Filipino family , his pride in his country, and his endearment to Imelda (\"Child of the Philippines\"). However, their relationship is short-lived: while Ninoy wishes to pursue politics and give voice to the people, Imelda is only interested in \"love and beauty,\" and they break up (\"Opposite Attraction\"). Imelda, brushing off the breakup as Ninoy deciding she was \"too tall\", joins and wins a beauty pageant (\"Rose of Tacloban\"). Estrella suggests she move to Manila to try to climb the social ladder. She arrives around the same time that Ferdinand Marcos is becoming even more famous (\"A Perfect Hand\"). Ferdinand and Imelda meet each other and engage in a whirlwind courtship that quickly leads to marriage (\"Eleven Days\"). Estrella, having been left behind in Imelda's rise in status, admires from afar and reminisces (\"When She Passed By\").\n\nFerdinand and Imelda honeymoon and become a power couple among the Philippines' upper class (\"Sugartime Baby\"). As the years pass, Imelda reflects on her more innocent childhood days in poverty but decides she will become the perfect wife to the Senator, all while self-medicating to suppress the stress of life in the public sphere (\"Walk Like a Woman\"). Maria Luisa, an expression of Imelda's inner self, encourages her to become a figure for the country at large. Imelda and Ferdinand campaign as part of Ferdinand's presidential bid, promising various construction projects to improve the country's image, and end up winning (\"Don't You Agree? / Pretty Face\").\n\nIn Malaca\u00f1ang , Imelda spearheads lavish parties and travels overseas to party with celebrities in New York at Studio 54 and other society haunts (\"Dancing Together\"). However, unrest begins to stir in the Philippines due to the Marcoses spending the peoples' money on parties and construction projects over infrastructure and public health; in the wake of these events, including the Manila Film Center disaster , an opposition movement forms under the now-Senator Ninoy Aquino, who puts aside his past with Imelda and the potential risk against his life to become one of the Marcoses' most outspoken critics (\"Fabulous One\"). Around the same time, Ferdinand engages in an affair with Dovie Beams : Maria Luisa sings to a grief-stricken Imelda that this could only be expected from a man like Ferdinand (\"Men Will Do Anything\"). As Imelda reflects on her life, she decides her new purpose is in service of the Philippines, choosing to symbolically rid herself of her past (\"Star and Slave\"). When Ferdinand becomes sick, he begs for forgiveness. Fed up with him, Imelda declares that she will run the country as he is too weak to effectively govern; she becomes the de facto leader of the Philippines, though the regime maintains that Ferdinand is still in charge (\"Poor Me\").\n\nUnrest only escalates under Imelda's leadership, with Ninoy calling attention to the regime's crackdown on dissenters, but Imelda distracts the clubgoers and international leaders with parties and diplomacy (\"Please Don't\"). Estrella does a tell-all interview revealing Imelda's poor background, undermining the narrative Imelda tries to push that she was born into a wealthy family. Imelda, increasingly delusional with power, confronts Estrella and offers her money to retract her statements. When Estrella refuses, Imelda has her imprisoned (\"Solano Avenue\"). Due to the growing numbers of protests in Manila (\"Riots and Bombs\"), Ferdinand declares martial law , and the ensemble sings of their experiences and suffering, mocking the fa\u00e7ade of safety the Marcoses claim to provide (\"Order 1081\"). Among the dissenters is Ninoy, who criticizes the Marcoses for events like the Plaza Miranda bombing , and he is eventually imprisoned for seven years. Imelda visits Ninoy in his cell and, citing their past relationship and her claimed sympathy to his plight, frees him on the condition he goes to the United States and never comes back, offering a veiled threat that he will be killed if he remains (\"Seven Years\"). Ninoy flees to the United States with his wife Cory and son Benny but returns in 1983, only to be assassinated on the tarmac , implied to be at Imelda's orders (\"Gate 37\").\n\nAt his funeral, Ninoy's mother Aurora calls for the people to revolt as the attendees don yellow armbands, raise their hands in the Laban sign , and burn Imelda and Ferdinand in effigy (\"Just Ask the Flowers\"). As the Marcoses' popularity and support crumbles, Imelda pathetically asks the people why they have turned against her after all she believes she did for them, while specters of Estrella, Ferdinand, and Maria Luisa similarly accuse her of abandoning them after they helped her get where she is (\"Why Don't You Love Me?\"). In the wake of the People Power Revolution , Imelda and Ferdinand are evacuated from the palace by a U.S. Air Force helicopter, bringing their regime to an end. As they leave, a still-delusional Imelda continues to insist she did everything \"for love\".\n\nIn the silence that follows, the DJ comes down from his booth. He sings the story of the People Power Revolution while playing his guitar, gradually joined by the rest of the ensemble as they collectively marvel at the peaceful end to an otherwise violent regime (\"God Draws Straight\").",

        "synopsis": "At the finals of the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (ICCA), Barden University's all-female a cappella group, the Barden Bellas, lose to their all-male rival group, the Barden Treblemakers, after Bellas singer Aubrey projectile vomits as a result of stage fright .\n\nSeveral months later, Beca Mitchell enrolls at Barden at the insistence of her father, who demands that she try college before attempting to become a music producer. Much to his chagrin, Beca spends her time making mash-ups of songs and interning at the university radio station, where she befriends fellow freshman Jesse Swanson.\n\nThe new leaders of the Bellas, Aubrey and Chloe, begin recruiting new members. Beca auditions with a rendition of \" Cups (When I'm Gone) \" and earns a place in the group alongside seven other newcomers, including Fat Amy. Meanwhile, Treblemakers leader Bumper Allen welcomes Jesse onto the team, but rejects Jesse's roommate Benji.\n\nAubrey conducts an initiation ritual for the new Bellas, making them swear an oath to never become sexually involved with members of the Treblemakers. After two Bellas break the promise, Aubrey kicks them out. During rehearsal, Aubrey insists on performing the same medley repeatedly, while Beca urges the Bellas to be more creative and daring.\n\nAfter the Bellas perform poorly during a gig at a fraternity, Chloe admits to the group that she has vocal nodes . At the radio station, Beca gives several of her mixes to the station manager, but he declines to play any of them. However, Jesse listens to Beca's mixes and praises her talent.\n\nThe Bellas face off against other a capella groups in a competitive \"riff-off\". They lose to the Treblemakers, but they soon participate in the ICCA Regionals. Despite the Bellas' bland, rehashed medley, they place second thanks to an exciting solo by Fat Amy. After the competition, Beca and Fat Amy accidentally smash a window, leading to Beca's arrest. Jesse contacts Beca's father to bail her out, which upsets Beca.\n\nDuring the ICCA semi-finals, Beca inserts an impromptu layering of \" Bulletproof \" into the group's rendition of \" The Sign \" to win over the bored audience. Although the improvisation impresses the judges, Aubrey angrily scolds Beca for not adhering to their planned medley. She also accuses Beca of hooking up with Jesse, which Jesse denies. Beca responds by snapping at them both and quitting the Bellas. Meanwhile, Benji discovers that the lead singer of the runner-up group the Footnotes is still in high school, which leads to the Footnotes being disqualified and the Bellas being invited to the finals.\n\nDuring spring break, Chloe unsuccessfully attempts to bring Beca back to the Bellas. Beca's father encourages her to rejoin the group, stating that they need her as much as she needs them. Beca also tries to apologize to Jesse but he rejects her claiming she pushes away those who care for her. During a Bellas rehearsal, various members stand up to Aubrey, who has been exerting tight control over the group. Beca arrives as the Bellas are fighting, and apologizes for spontaneously changing the set. Aubrey agrees to let Beca rejoin the group, and gives her a leadership role. Meanwhile, Bumper leaves the Treblemakers after being offered a job as a back-up singer for John Mayer . With the Treblemakers short one singer, Jesse invites Benji to join the group.\n\nAt the ICCA finals, the Bellas win the championship with a medley arranged by Beca, which includes the songs \" Price Tag \", \" Don't You (Forget About Me) \", \" Just the Way You Are \", \" Give Me Everything \" and \" Party in the U.S.A. \".

The opening number ( What Are the Odds ) tracks the evolution of the human race, all the way up to the moment when the foursome arrive at this very moment in time, on this stage, at this theatre, in front of this audience. Naturally, the discussion turns to the teaching of Trappist monk Thomas Merton , \"because nothing says musical theatre like a discussion about a Trappist monk .\" Merton asked folks to keep in mind three words: Now (not the past or the future), Here (exactly where you are), and This (whatever it is you're doing). Merton believed that if you can get to the intersection of these three things (\"Now. Here. This.), then you will be truly present to experience \"more life.\" The scene shifts to a planetarium exhibit in the museum, and the foursome ponder life's big and small questions, each expressing their desire for things that they hope will bring them happiness: more stuff, more love, more magic dogs named \"Mr. Winston Sparkles\" ( More Life ). The group decides to divide and conquer the museum in search of more life and the Now. Here. This. As they explore, exhibits begin to trigger memories and stories. At the deep sea exhibit, Jeff relives his experience performing at his middle school's Pancake Supper where she slays the audience with a mean Ed Grimley impersonation, and discovers his ability to cloak his true self from unwanted scrutiny ( Dazzle Camouflage ). For Heidi, it's recollections of childhood attention-seeking in the Hall of Birds ( Give Me Your Attention ). Hunter escapes into his familiar fantasy world while staring at a turtle display, imagining good times with his superdeluxe fantasy boyfriend ( Archer ), and at the bee exhibit, Susan recognizes herself as the busy bee who over-schedules her life with activities to distract from the discomfort of growing up in an unusual house ( I Rarely Schedule Nothing ). As their memories and stories grow into a chaotic ( Cacophony ), they all begin to understand the obstacles that stand between them and the Now. Here. This. The four then regroup in the Hall of Human Origins. Native garments and rituals ignite adolescent hopes of the perfect garment that will bring happiness and popularity ( Members Only ). Susan and Heidi sing about two kinds of lives with two different sets of struggles ( That'll Never Be Me ). Jeff recalls the regret of missing out on real college friends and fun because he was afraid to reveal his true self ( Kick Me ). The four friends continue to explore the museum and come across information about Aboriginal family trees and tribes. The gang sings in celebration of having found each other--their chosen tribe--out of all the people in the world ( Then Comes You ). A museum exhibit about the measurement of time inspires them to sing about an afternoon boat ride that seemed to last a millennium ( The Amazing Adventures of the \"Doc\" Wilbert S. Pound ).

        "synopsis": "Charles Dickens ( Gonzo ) and his friend Rizzo serve as narrators of the story of Ebenezer Scrooge , a greedy, penny-pinching and lonely moneylender of 19th-century London , who does not share the merriment of Christmas. On Christmas Eve , he rejects his nephew Fred's invitation to Christmas dinner, dismisses two gentlemen ( Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker ) collecting money for charity, and hurls a wreath at a carol-singing Bean Bunny . His kind, humble employee Bob Cratchit ( Kermit the Frog ) and the other bookkeepers request not to work on Christmas Day, since there will be no business for Scrooge on the day, to which he reluctantly agrees.\n\nThat night, Scrooge encounters the shackled ghosts of his late business partners, Jacob and Robert Marley ( Statler and Waldorf ), in his bed chambers. They warn him to repent of his wicked ways, or be condemned to wear chains and suffer in the afterlife as they do. They tell Scrooge that three spirits will visit him during the night to help him change his ways.\n\nAt one o'clock, Scrooge is visited by the childlike Ghost of Christmas Past , who shows him visions of his childhood and early adult life. Along with Dickens and Rizzo, they visit his lonely school days and then his time as an employee at Fozziwig 's ( Fozzie Bear ) rubber chicken factory. There, at Fozziwig's Christmas party, Scrooge meets a young woman named Belle, with whom he falls in love but she leaves him as he chooses money over her. A despondent Scrooge tells the Ghost to leave him and is returned to his home.\n\nScrooge next meets the gigantic, merry Ghost of Christmas Present , who shows him the joys and wonders of Christmas Day. Scrooge and the Ghost visit Fred's house, where Scrooge is made fun of for his stinginess and general ill will toward all. Scrooge and the spirit then visit Bob Cratchit's house, learning his family is content with the little they have. Scrooge also takes pity on Bob's ill son Tiny Tim ( Robin the Frog ), whom the Ghost comments will soon die if things continue the way they are.\n\nThe Ghost leaves Scrooge to the mysterious Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come , who takes Scrooge into the future where a recent death elicits no sympathy from the inhabitants of London, and the stolen possessions of the deceased are sold to a fence named Old Joe. Due to the creepy atmosphere, the narrators decide to leave. The Ghost also shows Scrooge the Cratchits' home, where they find Bob and his family mourning the death of Tiny Tim. Scrooge is led to the cemetery, where the Ghost points out the neglected grave of the unloved man; Scrooge wipes the snow away on the tombstone to see that it bears his name. Horrified, Scrooge tearfully vows to change his ways and suddenly finds himself back in his bedroom.\n\nFinding it is Christmas Day, an overjoyed Scrooge begins spreading happiness and joy around London, agreeing to give money to the gentlemen's charity, reconciling with Fred and his wife, and leaving coals for his bookkeepers. The narrators return to resume the story. Scrooge tells Bean to buy the poulterer's prize turkey, and they, along with Dickens, Rizzo, and the gentlemen, deliver it to Bob's family; Scrooge announces to Bob that he will raise his salary and pay off his mortgage, as Dickens tells that Tiny Tim escaped death thanks to Scrooge's new generosity, and everyone celebrates Christmas together.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn July 1899, a group of orphaned and homeless newsboys live in a Lower Manhattan lodging house with their informal leader, seventeen-year-old Jack Kelly. In the early hours of the morning, Jack tells his best friend, Crutchie, of his dream to one day leave New York for a better life out West (\" Santa Fe (Prologue)\"). As the sun rises, the rest of the newsies awaken and prepare for a day on the job, finding as much joy as they can in their life of poverty (\"Carrying the Banner\"). At the circulation gate, Jack meets a new newsboy named Davey and his nine-year-old brother Les. Unlike the other newsies, the brothers have a home and a loving family, and have been pulled out of school only temporarily to support their parents while their father is out of work with an injury. Seeing young Les as an opportunity to sell more papers as a guilt trip, Jack offers to be their partner. Meanwhile, the publisher of the New York World , Joseph Pulitzer , expresses his displeasure at his newspaper's declining circulation. To increase his profits, he decides to increase the cost of the papers for the newsies, (the newsies first have to buy papers to then go and sell them) ignoring his secretary's concerns that \"it's going to be awfully rough on those children\" (\"The Bottom Line\").\n\nLater, Jack, Davey, and Les are selling their final newspapers of the day when the corrupt Warden Snyder of the Refuge, a juvenile detention center, recognizes Jack as an escapee from his institution. He attempts to chase the boys down, but they find cover in a vaudeville -style theatre owned by Jack's friend Medda Larkin, whom he regularly paints backdrops for. As Medda performs (\"That's Rich\"), Jack spots a young female reporter named Katherine Plumber. She rebuffs Jack's attempts to flirt with her, but she is then charmed when he leaves her with a sketch of her portrait (\"Don\u2019t Come A-Knocking/I Never Planned on You\").\n\nThe next morning, the newsies discover that the cost of newspapers has been raised to sixty cents per hundred. Outraged, Jack declares the newsies to be a union and organizes a protest (\"The World Will Know\"). Katherine decides to cover the strike, seeing it as an opportunity to be taken more seriously as a journalist (\"Watch What Happens\"). The next day, the boys have informed the rest of the city's newsies about the strike, but each neighborhood claims that they will only join once Spot Conlon, leader of the Brooklyn newsies, gives the okay. The newsies are discouraged by the lack of support, but Davey convinces them to protest regardless of who shows (\"Seize the Day\"). Scabs arrive to take the newsies' jobs, but are persuaded to join the strike by Jack, who delivers an impassioned speech condemning child labor and the city's treatment of the poor. The protest appears to be headed for success, but is soon cut short when Pulitzer's goon squad and the police arrive to break it up by force. During the ensuing fight, Crutchie is apprehended, badly beaten, and taken to the Refuge. A devastated Jack escapes to the lodging house rooftop and, blaming himself for the protest's failure, fantasizes about running away forever (\"Santa Fe\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe next morning, Katherine finds the battered and bruised newsies in Jacobi's Deli, only to learn that no one knows where Jack is as rumors circulate about his whereabouts. She cheers the other newsies up by showing them that her article about the strike made the front page of the New York Sun . Thrilled, the boys rejoice at making the headline and imagine what it would be like to be famous (\"King of New York\"). However, Pulitzer has declared a blackout on strike news, meaning Katherine's story will be the only one to run. Meanwhile, Crutchie writes a letter to Jack, describing the filthy and abusive conditions at the Refuge. He asks Jack to make sure the newsies continue to look out for one another, signing the letter, \"your brother, Crutchie\" (\"Letter from the Refuge\"). Later, Davey finds Jack hiding out in the basement of Medda's theatre and informs him of his plan to hold a citywide rally in the theatre. Jack, distraught over Crutchie's arrest, refuses to put the other boys back in danger, but Davey, along with Katherine and Les, convinces him that their fight is too important to quit (\"Watch What Happens (Reprise)\").\n\nBack at the World , an angry Pulitzer plots with Warden Snyder about how to stop Jack. Snyder reveals that Jack was originally sentenced to the Refuge for vagrancy, but has since become a \"frequent visitor,\" with his most recent arrest being for trafficking stolen food and clothing. Jack soon arrives with an invitation for Pulitzer to attend the rally Davey has planned. Pulitzer declines, assuring Jack that no newspaper will violate the blackout order by covering the rally. Pulitzer claims that if it's not in the papers, it never happened. Jack attempts to counter by claiming the newsies already have a reporter on their side, but Pulitzer reveals that Katherine is his daughter and that \"Plumber\" is only her pen name . He offers Jack a choice: if the strike is called off, Jack will be cleared of all charges and given enough money to leave for Santa Fe, but if not, he and the other newsies will all be arrested and sent to the Refuge (\"The Bottom Line (Reprise)\"). Katherine, who has been listening in secret, attempts to apologize to Jack, but he brushes her off as he is detained by Pulitzer's goons and led into the cellar.\n\nThe next morning, Spot Conlon and the Brooklyn newsies declare their support of the strike and head to the rally (\"Brooklyn's Here\"). Jack, believing there is no way the newsies can win against Pulitzer's money, power, and connections, shows up to the rally to reluctantly suggest the strike be called off. He accepts the Santa Fe money from one of Pulitzer's men as Davey, Spot, and the other newsies watch in disbelief, calling him a traitor and a scab. Jack flees to his rooftop, only to find that Katherine has beaten him there. She has discovered Jack's drawings of the abuse he suffered at the Refuge among his belongings and realizes that he stole to feed and clothe the other boys. They argue about their respective betrayals and the fate of the strike, but the argument is cut short when she impulsively kisses him. Katherine has a new idea: use Jack's drawings and one of her articles to print their own newspaper, calling for every worker under 21 to strike alongside the newsies. Jack agrees, recalling an abandoned printing press in Pulitzer's cellar, but before getting to work, they share a romantic moment, each stating that the other has given them \"something to believe in\" (\"Something to Believe In\").\n\nThe other newsies join Jack and Katherine in printing their own paper, the Newsies Banner , and distribute copies throughout the city (\"Once and for All\"). A copy reaches Governor Theodore Roosevelt , who arrives in full support of the newsies' cause. Roosevelt gives Pulitzer an ultimatum, forcing the latter to concede to Jack's demands. Jack proposes that Pulitzer buy back every paper the newsies fail to sell each day. Initially reluctant, Pulitzer agrees when Jack points out he will still ultimately benefit from the increased sales. Jack and Roosevelt inform the newsies that the strike is over and they have won. As the newsies celebrate, Roosevelt informs them that he has shut down the Refuge, citing Jack's drawings as his motivation to do so. Crutchie returns to his friends, and Snyder is arrested. Impressed at the influence Jack's drawings had on the governor, Pulitzer offers him a job as a daily political cartoonist . Jack declines, claiming it is time he leaves for Santa Fe, but Davey, Katherine, and Crutchie remind him that \"New York's got us, and we're your family.\" Ultimately, Jack decides to stay and chooses to remain a newsboy as well as accept the cartoonist job (\"Finale\").",

        "title": "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day",
        "description": "Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day is a 1968 American animated musical fantasy short film based on the third, fifth, ninth, and tenth chapters of Winnie-the-Pooh and the second, eighth, and ninth chapters from The House at Pooh Corner by A. A. Milne . The featurette was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman , produced by Walt Disney Productions , and released by Buena Vista Distribution Company on December 20, 1968, having been shown in theaters with The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit . This was the second of the studio's Winnie the Pooh theatrical featurettes. It was later added as a segment to the 1977 film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh . The music was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman . It was notable for being the last Disney animated short to be produced by Walt Disney , who died of lung cancer on December 15, 1966, two years before its release. It starred the voices of Sterling Holloway as Winnie the Pooh, Jon Walmsley as Christopher Robin (replaced Bruce Reitherman ), Barbara Luddy as Kanga, Clint Howard as Roo, Paul Winchell as Tigger, Ralph Wright as Eeyore, Hal Smith as Owl, Howard Morris as Gopher, John Fiedler as Piglet, Junius Matthews as Rabbit, and Sebastian Cabot as the narrator.\n\nWinnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day won the 1968 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film . The Academy Award was awarded posthumously to Disney. This was also the only Winnie the Pooh production to ever win an Academy Award. ( Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too , which was released six years later in December 1974, was nominated for the same Academy Award, but lost to Closed Mondays .) The animated featurette also served as an inspiration for the Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh ride in the Disney theme parks in which the rider experiences several scenes from the cartoon, including Pooh's Heffalump and Woozle dream. A modified version of the featurette's poster was used for The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977).",
        "synopsis": "On a very windy day, Winnie the Pooh visits his \"thoughtful spot\". Gopher arrives and advises him to leave, claiming that it is a \" Winds-day \". Misunderstanding Gopher's warning, Pooh decides to wish everyone in the Hundred Acre Wood a happy Winds-day. He starts with his best friend Piglet , who is nearly blown away while trying to rake leaves. Pooh grabs Piglet by his scarf, which unravels and leaves Piglet hanging on like a kite. The wind blows Pooh and Piglet to Owl 's treehouse, where he invites them in. During their stay, the strong wind causes Owl's tree to sway and eventually collapse, taking the house with it. Upon learning that Owl's house is wrecked beyond repair, Eeyore volunteers to seek out a new house for Owl.\n\nThat night, Pooh is visited by a bouncing tiger named Tigger , who states that he has come looking for something to eat. Disgusted by the taste of Pooh's honey, Tigger warns him about creatures called Heffalumps and Woozles that steal honey before he leaves. Frightened by Tigger's words, Pooh stays up to guard his honey but falls asleep as a thunderstorm brews. After having a nightmare about being attacked by Heffalumps and Woozles, Pooh wakes up in a flood caused by the storm.\n\nIn the flood, Piglet is washed away from his home on a floating chair, but not before he manages to write a message in a bottle for help. Meanwhile, Pooh manages to escape to higher ground with ten honey pots, only to also be washed away by the rising waters. The rest of the Hundred Acre Wood 's populace gathers at Christopher Robin 's house, the only place in the Wood that isn't flooded, except for Eeyore, who has refused to give up house hunting for Owl. The group soon discover Piglet's bottle, and Owl flies off to tell Piglet that help is on the way.\n\nOwl eventually finds Piglet and Pooh together. While he attempts to ease Piglet's fears with a story, Piglet notices that they are approaching a waterfall . Pooh inadvertently switches places with Piglet as they take the plunge, and the waterfall washes them right into Christopher Robin's yard. Thinking that Pooh has rescued Piglet, Christopher Robin deems Pooh a hero. Once the flood subsides, Christopher Robin throws a party for Pooh, where Eeyore announces that he has found a new home for Owl, which, known to everyone except Owl and Eeyore, is actually Piglet's house. Rather than explain the misunderstanding, Piglet generously lets Owl have his home and accepts Pooh's invitation to live with him. At Pooh's request, Christopher Robin declares the occasion a \"two hero party\" in celebration of Pooh's heroism and Piglet's selflessness. The party is a success with the residents of the Hundred Acre Wood but Gopher, who had apparently not been invited. Pooh lands on Gopher's head, during a parachute jump, when the latter comes out of his hole to question the commotion.",

Originally titled More Grease , the film was produced by Allan Carr and Robert Stigwood , and directed and choreographed by Patricia Birch , who choreographed the original stage production and prior film. The plot returns to Rydell High School two years after the original film's graduation , with a largely new cast, led by Maxwell Caulfield and Michelle Pfeiffer in her first starring role.\n\nThe film was released in United States theaters on June 11, 1982 by Paramount Pictures , and grossed $15 million against a production budget of $11 million, a far cry from its predecessor's $132 million domestic box office. Despite breakthrough roles for Pfeiffer, Adrian Zmed , and Christopher McDonald , the film received mostly mixed reviews from critics; however, Grease 2 maintains a devoted fan base decades after its release. The film is now regarded as a cult classic .",
        "synopsis": "In September 1961, three years after the events of the prior film (\"Alma Mater\" from the original stage musical ), Principal McGee and her secretary Blanche react in horror as students arrive at Rydell High to start a new academic year (\"Back to School Again\"). Among them are the trendy \"bad-girl\" Pink Ladies and the laid-back, motorcycle -riding ruffian T-Birds. Stephanie Zinone, the new leader of the Pink Ladies, feels she has \"outgrown\" her relationship with ex-boyfriend Johnny Nogerelli, the arrogant, chauvinistic and rather immature bully leader of the T-Birds.\n\nClean-cut British student Michael Carrington (a cousin of Sandy Olsson from the previous film) is introduced to the atmosphere by former Pink Lady Frenchy, who offers to orientate him. She has returned to Rydell to obtain her diploma so she can start her own cosmetics company (as preluded with \" Beauty School Dropout \" in the previous film). Michael eventually meets Stephanie, and quickly becomes smitten with her.\n\nAt the local bowling alley , a game between both cliques (\"Score Tonight\") turns hostile between Johnny and Stephanie, culminating in him kissing her friend Paulette Rebchuck. In retaliation, Stephanie kisses the next man who walks in the door, who happens to be Michael. Bemused by the unexpected kiss, Michael asks her out the next day at an audition for the upcoming school talent show, but learns she has standards for her ideal suitor (\"Cool Rider\"). Attempting to appropriately attain her affection, Michael starts covertly selling completed homework assignments and term papers to the academically-challenged T-Birds to save enough money for a motorcycle. Meanwhile, substitute teacher Mr. Stuart leads a rousing biology lesson (\"Reproduction\").\n\nRival motorcycle gang the Cycle Lords, led by Leo \"Craterface\" Balmudo, surprises the T-Birds at the bowling alley. Before a fight ensues, a lone, mysterious \"Cool Rider\" arrives, defeats the enemy gang, and disappears into the night (\"Who's That Guy?\"), astounding Stephanie. Meanwhile, T-Bird Louis DiMucci attempts to trick his sweetheart, Pink Lady Sharon Cooper, into losing her virginity to him by taking her to a fallout shelter and faking a nuclear attack (\"Let's Do It for Our Country\").\n\nWhile Stephanie is working at her after-school job as an automobile mechanic at her family's gas station/auto garage, the Cool Rider surprises her with a romantic twilight motorcycle ride to a hilltop. Before he can reveal his identity, the T-Birds and Pink Ladies interrupt them, and he vows to reunite with her at the talent show . Johnny, enraged by Stephanie's new romance, threatens physical violence towards the Cool Rider if her new relationship continues. The Pink Ladies depart haughtily, ignoring the T-Birds' self-confidence (\"Prowlin'\").\n\nAt school, Stephanie's dismal grades in English lead her to accept Michael's offer of help. Johnny, having witnessed their encounter, demands that Stephanie denounce her association with the Pink Ladies to preserve his honor. Although she is still enchanted by the mysterious Cool Rider, her romantic interactions with Michael pressure him into questioning his facade (\"Charades\").\n\nStephanie and the Cool Rider reunite at the talent show but the T-Birds abruptly ambush them and pursue him to a closed-off construction site on their respective motorcycles, with the Pink Ladies following in a car. The site conceals a deadly drop, and the biker's absence suggests that he has gone over the edge and perished, devastating Stephanie. Prior to \"Prowlin'\", the T-Birds sabotage the competing Preptones by tying them to a shower pole in the boys' locker room. During the Pink Ladies' performance (\"Girl for All Seasons\"), an emotional Stephanie obliviously enters a dreamlike, fantasy world, where she reunites with her mystery biker (\"(Love Will) Turn Back the Hands of Time\"). She is named winner of the contest, and she and Johnny crowned Queen and King of the upcoming graduation luau .\n\nThe Cycle Lords gatecrash the luau the following day (\"Rock-a-Hula Luau (Summer Is Coming)\"), but the Cool Rider reappears, overpowers them, and reveals himself as Michael. Initially shocked, Johnny subsequently presents him with a T-Birds jacket, officially welcoming him into the gang, and Michael and an overjoyed Stephanie cement their relationship with a passionate kiss. All the couples pair-off happily, and after the senior class graduates (\"We'll Be Together\"), the credits roll in yearbook -style, as in the original film (\"Back to School Again\").",

After stealing a loaf of bread for his sister's starving child, Valjean is imprisoned for 19 years and released in 1815. When a bishop inspires him with a tremendous act of mercy, Valjean breaks his parole and starts his life anew and in disguise. He becomes wealthy and adopts an orphan, Cosette.

        "synopsis": "### Prologue\n\nIn 1815 France, Jean Valjean , \"Prisoner 24601\", is released on parole by guard Javert after 19 years hard labor in prison for stealing bread (\"Work Song (Look Down)\"). Marked by his yellow ticket of leave (\"On Parole\"), Valjean is shunned and cannot find decent work until the Bishop of Digne offers him shelter. Valjean steals the Bishop's silver, but the Bishop pretends to have given it to him and also gives him a pair of silver candlesticks (\"Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven\"). Valjean vows to start an honest life (\"Valjean's Soliloquy (What Have I Done?)\"). He tears up his ticket, breaking parole.\n\n### Act I\n\nBy 1823, Valjean is living disguised as Monsieur Madeleine, a factory owner and the mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer . Fantine , a single mother working at Valjean's factory, is fired after a disagreement with the lustful foreman and sinks into poverty (\"At the End of the Day\"; \" I Dreamed a Dream \"), selling her locket and hair, and becoming a prostitute (\"Lovely Ladies\"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Javert, now a police inspector, arrests her. Valjean intervenes and takes her to a hospital (\"Fantine's Arrest\").\n\nWhen Valjean rescues a man pinned by a runaway cart, Javert, who has pursued him over the years, suspects his true identity. Learning an innocent man is about to be jailed in his place, Valjean confesses (\"Who Am I?\"). At the hospital, Fantine dies after Valjean promises to rescue her daughter Cosette from the thieving Th\u00e9nardiers , innkeepers who are paid to raise her (\"Fantine's Death (Come to Me)\"). Valjean escapes Javert (\"The Confrontation\"). In Montfermeil , the Th\u00e9nardiers use Cosette as a servant, treating her cruelly, while extorting money from Fantine (\"Castle on a Cloud\"; \"Master of the House\"). Valjean pays them 1,500 francs to release Cosette (\"The Bargain\") and takes her to Paris (\"The Waltz of Treachery\").\n\nIn 1832 Paris, unrest grows with the impending death of the merciful General Lamarque . Student revolutionaries Marius Pontmercy and Enjolras prepare for an uprising. The Th\u00e9nardiers, who have lost their inn and now lead a gang of street criminals, plot scams. Their daughter \u00c9ponine befriends the streetwise urchin Gavroche (\"Look Down\"). She secretly loves Marius, but he falls instantly for Cosette when he meets her with Valjean, whom the Th\u00e9nardiers attempt to rob (\"The Robbery\"). Valjean is recognized, but he and Cosette escape; Javert vows to recapture him (\"Stars\"). Marius persuades \u00c9ponine to help him find Cosette (\"\u00c9ponine\u2019s Errand\").\n\nAs Enjolras rallies the students (\"The ABC Caf\u00e9/Red and Black\"), Marius pines for Cosette. News of Lamarque\u2019s death sparks plans for revolution (\" Do You Hear the People Sing? \"). Cosette confronts Valjean about his secrets (\"In My Life\"). \u00c9ponine finds Cosette, and Marius and Cosette confess their love (\"A Heart Full of Love\"). Th\u00e9nardier and his gang arrive to rob Valjean's house but are foiled by \u00c9ponine\u2019s warning (\"The Attack on Rue Plumet\"). Believing Javert has found him, Valjean plans to flee with Cosette. On the eve of the 1832 Paris Uprising , Enjolras exhorts all of Paris to join the revolution. \u00c9ponine acknowledges in anguish that Marius will never love her. Javert plans to spy on, while the students and rebels steel themselves for battle (\" One Day More \").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe students build a barricade; Marius discovers that \u00c9ponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels (\"Building the Barricade\"). To keep her safe, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette (\" On My Own \"). Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. The French army arrives, demanding surrender (\"At the Barricade\"). Javert, disguised as a rebel, is exposed as a spy by young Gavroche (\"Little People\"). Wounded during the fighting, \u00c9ponine dies in Marius\u2019s arms, confessing her love (\"A Little Fall of Rain (Eponine's Death)\").\n\nValjean arrives disguised as a soldier, hoping to protect Marius (\"Night of Anguish\"). He saves Enjolras from a soldier. Valjean releases Javert instead of executing him, shaking Javert\u2019s rigid view of God and justice (\"The First Attack\"). As dawn approaches, the students prepare for attack (\"Drink with Me\"). Valjean prays for Marius's safety, offering God his own life (\"Bring Him Home\"). Enjolras realizes the people of Paris have not risen up but resolves to fight on (\"Dawn of Anguish\"). The army attacks; Gavroche is killed (\"The Second Attack (Death of Gavroche)\"), and all the students but Marius die. Valjean carries a gravely wounded Marius through the sewers and collapses (\"The Final Battle\"). Th\u00e9nardier, looting bodies, comes upon the unconscious Valjean and Marius, taking a ring from the latter and fleeing (\"Dog Eats Dog\"). At the sewer's exit, Valjean finds Javert waiting; he begs Javert for time to bring Marius to a doctor. Javert, unable to reconcile Valjean\u2019s mercy with his worldview, kills himself (\"Javert\u2019s Suicide\").\n\nParis mourns the fallen students (\"Turning\"). Marius grieves his friends and wonders who saved him (\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\"). Valjean blesses Marius and Cosette\u2019s marriage (\"Every Day\") but tells Marius he is an escaped convict and must leave to protect Cosette (\"Valjean\u2019s Confession\"). At their wedding (\"Wedding Chorale\"), the Th\u00e9nardiers attempt to blackmail Marius, who realizes Valjean carried him from the barricades (\"Beggars at the Feast\"). Marius and Cosette rush to find Valjean.\n\n### Epilogue\n\nAt a convent, Valjean awaits death. Fantine\u2019s spirit assures him of forgiveness. Cosette and Marius arrive in time to bid farewell. Valjean thanks God for seeing Cosette grown and happy (\"Valjean\u2019s Death\"). He entrusts her with his past and tells her the truth about her mother. Guided by the spirits of Fantine and \u00c9ponine, who remind him that \"to love another person is to see the face of God\", he dies at peace, joining the souls of the fallen in a hopeful vision of freedom (\"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" (reprise)\").",

It won four Laurence Olivier Awards , including Best New Musical. The first North American performance was at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas .

Harvey Keitel starred as Jerry.\n\nIn January 2005, its British television broadcast on BBC Two elicited 55,000 complaints. The organisation Christian Voice led street protests against the screening at nine BBC offices and announced their intention to bring blasphemy charges, due to the depictions of the Christian characters in Act II. The Christian Institute attempted to bring a private prosecution against the BBC, but the magistrates' court refused to issue a summons, a decision which was later upheld by the High Court of Justice . Protests continued at tour venues in 2006 and on the Internet.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nJerry Springer 's frenzied audience greets him as he arrives at his notorious TV talk show. His first guest, Dwight, is cheating on Peaches with Zandra. The three fight, and Jerry's security men break up the battle. Jerry is briefly admonished by his inner Valkyrie . Dwight is also cheating with a cross dresser named Tremont. After a commercial break, Jerry's second guest, Montel, tells his partner, Andrea, that he likes to dress as a baby and that he is cheating on her with Baby Jane, a woman who dresses as a little girl. Jerry's Warm-Up Man contributes to Andrea's humiliation and is fired. Jerry again wrestles with his inner Valkyrie. Jerry's final guests are Shawntel and her husband, Chucky. She wants to be a stripper and demonstrates a dance before her mother, Irene, arrives. Irene attacks Shawntel. Chucky pleads innocence, but Jerry's secret JerryCam camera footage shows that Chucky is a patron of strip clubs and a Ku Klux Klan member. The Klan comes up on stage, and the Warm Up Man gives Montel a gun. The Warm-Up Man jostles Montel, who accidentally shoots Jerry.\n\n### Act II\n\nJerry is found injured in a wheelchair, accompanied by his security man, Steve. The scene is Purgatory, a fog-enshrouded wilderness. Jerry meets ghostly versions of his talk show guests, who have all suffered unpleasant fates. Jerry tries to justify his actions to the ghosts. The Warm-Up Man arrives and is revealed to be Satan . Baby Jane asks Satan to spare Jerry's soul. Satan forces Jerry to return to Hell with him to do a special show.\n\n### Act III\n\nJerry arrives in Hell at a charred version of his Earthly TV studio. The audience is locked into cracks in its walls. Jerry reads cue cards produced by Baby Jane that introduce Satan, who is in charge of the proceedings. Satan seeks an apology for his expulsion from Heaven and wants to reunite Heaven and Hell. Jerry must faithfully read the cue cards, which introduce Jesus , the next guest, who resembles Montel. Jesus and Satan trade accusations. Adam and Eve are next; they are reminiscent of Chucky and Shawntel. They argue with Jesus, and Eve eventually attacks him. Mary, mother of Jesus , who resembles Irene, condemns Jesus. Everyone turns against Jerry, who hopes for a miracle.\n\nGod and the angels arrive and ask Jerry to come to Heaven and help God judge Humanity. He accepts the offer, but the angels and devils fight over Jerry; and the talk-show host finds himself suspended over a pit of flame. Jerry launches into a series of glib homilies asking for his life, but finally gives up and makes an honest statement that resounds with his audience. Devils, angels, and everyone sing a hymn of praise to life.\n\nBack on solid ground, Baby Jane tells Jerry that he must go back to Earth. Jerry wakes up in his television studio, having been shot, his life ebbing away as he is cradled in Steve's arms. Jerry gives a final speech, and everyone is joined in sorrow.",

The show has since been adapted for television, starring Rue McClanahan , and has spawned six sequels and three spin-offs .",
        "synopsis": "Five of the 19 surviving Little Sisters of Hoboken , a one-time missionary order that ran a leper colony on an island south of France , discover that their cook, Sister Julia, Child of God, accidentally killed the other fifty-two residents of the convent with her tainted vichyssoise while they were off playing bingo with a group of Maryknolls . Upon discovering the disaster, Mother Superior had a vision in which she was told to start a greeting card company to raise funds for the burials. The greeting cards were an enormous success and, thinking there was plenty of money, the Reverend Mother bought a VCR and camcorder for the convent, leaving her with no money in the kitty to pay for the last four burials. With the deceased nuns on ice in the deep freeze, they decide to stage a variety show in the Mount Saint Helen's School auditorium to raise the necessary amount. Participating in the project are Mother Superior Mary Regina, a former circus performer who can not resist the spotlight; her competitive but dignified rival, second-in-command Sister Mary Hubert; Sister Robert Anne, a streetwise nun from Brooklyn ; Sister Mary Leo, a novice who is determined to be the world's first ballerina nun; and wacky, childlike Sister Mary Amnesia, who lost her memory when a crucifix fell on her head.  The entertainment that they present includes solo star turns, madcap dance routines, and an audience quiz .\n\nNaturally, VCRs and camcorders are now no longer such current or expensive devices, so modern presentations of the show tend to substitute newer or more generic terms such as \"home entertainment system\" or a \"plasma TV\".\n\n### Act 1\n\nMother Superior opens the show by greeting the audience and apologizing for their set constraints (the middle school still has the set for \"Grease\" up), and the five nuns introduce themselves in the opening number (\"Nunsense is Habit-Forming\"). The Sisters then explain in song how they got where they are today, originally working in a leper colony near France, but quickly leaving after some of the Sisters developed leprosy themselves (\"A Difficult Transition\"), and after the song, Sister Amnesia quizzes the audience on it. Sister Mary Leo then performs a dance interpretation of morning at the convent ( Benedicite ), but starts to get too flamboyant, and is stopped by Sister Mary Hubert, who reminds her \"The Biggest Ain't The Best\". Reverend Mother comes back on stage, only to be stopped by Sister Robert Anne, who pleads with her to let her sing a solo. Reverend Mother refuses, reminding Robert Anne she is only the understudy, prompting Robert Anne to launch into a song about just that (\"Playing Second Fiddle\").\n\nMary Amnesia comes on next and sings a song about what it's like to be a nun, along with a foul-mouthed puppet, Sister Mary Annette (\"So You Want To Be A Nun\"). Reverend Mother returns and apologizes, but is shocked to hear from Mary Amnesia that the Jersey Board of Health has sent an inspector to the convent just that afternoon. Amnesia runs off crying, and the rest of the Sisters follow, except for Reverend Mother. She tells the audience how she became a nun, but still somewhat misses performing (\"Turn Up the Spotlight\"). Amnesia, Leo, and Hubert return, and learn that a local Jewish temple has sent them flowers wishing them good luck. They try to use the flowers to remind Amnesia of her past, but all she can get is a quick flashback (\"Lilacs\"). Robert Anne rushes on stage to give Reverend Mother a bag that she seems troubled about, claiming she found it in one of the girls' bathrooms. Reverend Mother dismisses the rest of the Sisters, and has a look in the bag, the contents of which ultimately get her high - hilariously so. The rest of the Sisters notice, and put on a hastily thrown-together tap number to close the first act and get her off the stage (\"Tackle That Temptation\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nRobert Anne opens the second act, overjoyed at being able to finally take a starring role. She sings a slow ballad about how church has changed since she was a little girl (\"Growing Up Catholic\"). The rest of the nuns rush on afterwards, led by an especially distraught Reverend Mother, who has received a summons from the Board of Health that \"We've Got to Clean Out the Freezer\". Reverend Mother is calmed down by Mary Hubert, who reminds her that they've got to stick together in times of crisis like this (\"Just a Coupl'a Sisters\"). Mary Leo and Robert Anne then perform \"The Dying Nun Ballet\", which the Reverend Mother does not receive well. Amnesia and Hubert return with Sister Julia, Child of God's cookbook and put on a short cooking show segment, which is interrupted by the fact that the book is full of misprints and innuendos. Reverend Mother finally gives in and lets Robert Anne sing her number, \"I Just Want to Be a Star\".\n\nAmnesia, Robert Anne, and Leo then perform an Andrews Sisters-type number (\"The Drive-In\"), then show a \"homemade convent film display\", which is shut off by Reverend Mother after it shows embarrassing clips of her. Amnesia remains on stage after the rest leave, and decides to tell the audience a story about who she would be if she wasn't a nun (\"I Could've Gone to Nashville\"). Mid-song, everything comes back to her and she remembers her real name - Sister Mary Paul - and her past. She was going to be a famous country singer, but chose the convent instead. She tells the rest of the sisters, who realize that Sister Mary Paul is also the name of the nun who just won the Publisher's Clearing House sweepstakes, and rejoice, thanking God for their good fortune. Sister Hubert closes the show with a rousing gospel number about what it takes to become a saint (\"Holier Than Thou\").",

She attempts to offer her husband Nicholas a new, more efficient, route around the world, but he is preoccupied by the letters to Santa as Christmas approaches. Feeling ready for a change in her life, Anna decides to assert her independence by testing the route herself, flying the sleigh pulled by Santa's reindeer for an impromptu journey (\"Mrs. Santa Claus\").\n\nA sudden storm forces her to make an emergency landing near the Statue of Liberty. She befriends the stable boy Marcello, who determines Cupid's injury will require a week of rest and recovery. Marcello offers to take \"Mrs. North\" to the best boarding house in the city; along the way he indicates the marvelous melting pot nature of his neighborhood , and Mrs. North enjoys the sights and sounds of a burgeoning and bustling New York City (\"Avenue A\").\n\nAt the boarding house, host Mrs. Lowenstein worries that her daughter Sadie is attracting police attention for soapboxing in favor of women's suffrage .

After her concerns about toy quality are ignored, Mrs. North vows to reform conditions at Tavish.\n\nSanta begins to worry about his wife after Arvo reveals that she's been gone for two days. Meanwhile in New York, Mrs. North helps Sadie gather a crowd to demand votes for women (\"Suffragette March\").

Outside a vaudeville show, Mrs. North and Nora cement their friendship and vow to help one another (\"Whistle\"). Back at the North Pole, devoid of his usual cheer, Santa expresses how deeply he misses his lifelong missus (\"Dear Mrs. Santa Claus\").\n\nAt the Tavish factory, Mrs. North has organized a work slowdown , and she is promptly fired. Nora leaves in solidarity (\"Whistle\" reprise).

        "title": "South Pacific (musical)",
        "description": "South Pacific is a musical composed by Richard Rodgers , with lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II and book by Hammerstein and Joshua Logan . The work premiered in 1949 on Broadway and was an immediate hit, running for 1,925 performances. The plot is based on James A. Michener 's Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning 1947 book Tales of the South Pacific and combines elements of several of those stories. Rodgers and Hammerstein believed they could write a musical based on Michener's work that would be financially successful and, at the same time, send a strong progressive message on racism.\n\nThe plot centers on an American nurse stationed on a South Pacific island during World War II, who falls in love with a middle-aged expatriate French plantation owner but struggles to accept his mixed-race children. A secondary romance, between a U.S. Marine lieutenant and a young Tonkinese woman, explores his fears of the social consequences should he marry his Asian sweetheart. The issue of racial prejudice is candidly explored throughout the musical, most controversially in the lieutenant's song, \" You've Got to Be Carefully Taught \".  Supporting characters, including a comic petty officer and the Tonkinese girl's mother, help to tie the stories together.  Because he lacked military knowledge, Hammerstein had difficulty writing that part of the script. The director of the original production, Logan, assisted him and received credit as co-writer of the book.\n\nThe original Broadway production enjoyed immense critical and box-office success, became the second-longest running Broadway musical to that point (behind Rodgers and Hammerstein's earlier Oklahoma! (1943)), and has remained popular ever since. After they signed Ezio Pinza and Mary Martin as the leads, Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote several of the songs with the particular talents of their stars in mind.  The piece won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1950.  Especially in the Southern U.S., its racial theme provoked controversy, for which its authors were unapologetic. Several of its songs, including \" Bali Ha'i \", \" I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair \", \" Some Enchanted Evening \", \" There Is Nothing Like a Dame \", \" Happy Talk \", \" Younger Than Springtime \", and \" I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy \", have become popular standards.\n\nThe production won ten Tony Awards , including Best Musical, Best Score, and Best Libretto, and it is the only musical production to win Tony Awards in all four acting categories. Its original cast album was the bestselling record of the 1940s, and other recordings of the show have also been popular. The show has enjoyed many successful revivals and tours, spawning a 1958 film and television adaptations. The 2008 Broadway revival, a critical success, ran for 996 performances and won seven Tonys, including Best Musical Revival.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nOn a South Pacific island during World War II, two half- Polynesian children, Ngana and Jerome, happily sing as they play together (\"Dites-Moi\"). Ensign Nellie Forbush, a na\u00efve U.S. Navy nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas , has fallen in love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right (\"A Cockeyed Optimist\"). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings (\"Twin Soliloquies\"). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other (\" Some Enchanted Evening \").  Nellie, promising to think about their relationship, returns to the hospital. Emile calls Ngana and Jerome to him, revealing to the audience that they are his children, unbeknownst to Nellie.\n\nMeanwhile, the restless American Seabees , led by crafty Luther Billis, lament the absence of available women\u00a0\u2013 Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed \"Bloody Mary\", a sassy middle-aged Tonkinese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter as she tries to sell them her wares (\"Bloody Mary\"). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i \u2013 which is off-limits to all but officers \u2013 supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of female companionship (\" There Is Nothing Like a Dame \").\n\nU.S. Marine Lieutenant Cable arrives on the island from Guadalcanal , having been sent to take part in a dangerous spy mission whose success could turn the tide of the war against Japan.  Bloody Mary tries to persuade Cable to visit \" Bali Ha'i \", mysteriously telling him that it is his special island. Billis, seeing an opportunity, urges Cable to go.  Cable meets with his commanding officers, Captain George Brackett and Commander William Harbison, who plan to ask Emile to help with the mission because he used to live on the island where the mission will take place. They ask Nellie to help them find out more about Emile's background, for example, his politics and why he left France. They have heard, for instance, that Emile committed a murder, and this might make him less than desirable for such a mission.\n\nAfter thinking a bit more about Emile and deciding she has become attracted on the basis of little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him (\" I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair \"). But when he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings (\" I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy \").\n\nCable's mission is to land on a Japanese-held island and report on Japanese ship movements. The Navy officers ask Emile to be Cable's guide, but he refuses their request because of his hopes for a new life with Nellie. Commander Harbison, the executive officer, tells Cable to go on leave until the mission can take place, and Billis obtains a boat and takes Cable to Bali Ha'i. There, Billis participates in the native ceremony, while Bloody Mary introduces Cable to her beautiful daughter, Liat, with whom he must communicate haltingly in French.  Believing that Liat's only chance at a better life is to marry an American officer, Mary leaves Liat alone with Cable. The two are instantly attracted to each other and make love (\" Younger Than Springtime \").  Billis and the rest of the crew are ready to leave the island, yet must wait for Cable who, unbeknownst to them, is with Liat (\"Bali Ha'i\" (reprise)). Bloody Mary proudly tells Billis that Cable is going to be her son-in-law.\n\nMeanwhile, after Emile's party, he and Nellie reflect on how happy they are to be in love (Reprises of \"I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy\", \"Twin Soliloquies\", \"Cockeyed Optimist\" and \"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair\").  Emile introduces Nellie to Jerome and Ngana.  Though she finds them charming, she is shocked when Emile reveals that they are his children by his first wife, a dark-skinned Polynesian woman, now deceased.  Nellie is unable to overcome her deep-seated racial prejudices and tearfully leaves Emile, after which he reflects sadly on what might have been (\"Some Enchanted Evening\" (reprise)).\n\n### Act II \n\nIt is Thanksgiving Day . The GIs and nurses dance in a holiday revue titled \"Thanksgiving Follies\". In the past week, an epidemic of malaria has hit the island of Bali Ha'i. Having visited Bali Ha'i often to be with Liat, Cable is also ill, but escapes from the hospital to be with Liat.  As Liat and Cable spend more time together, Bloody Mary is delighted. She encourages them to continue their carefree life on the island (\" Happy Talk \") and urges them to marry. Cable, aware of his family's prejudices, says he cannot marry a Tonkinese girl. Bloody Mary furiously drags her distraught daughter away, telling Cable that Liat must now marry a much older French plantation owner instead. Cable laments his loss (\"Younger Than Springtime\" (reprise)).\n\nFor the final number of the Thanksgiving Follies, Nellie performs a comedy burlesque dressed as a sailor singing the praises of \"his\" sweetheart (\"Honey Bun\"). Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot feel the same way about him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother.  Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that \"it's not something you're born with\", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing (\" You've Got to Be Carefully Taught \"). He also vows that if he gets out of the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been (\"This Nearly Was Mine\"). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.\n\nThe mission begins with plenty of air support. Offstage, Billis stows away on the plane, falls out when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire, and ends up in the ocean waiting to be rescued; the massive rescue operation inadvertently becomes a diversion that allows Emile and Cable to land on the other side of the island undetected. The two send back reports on Japanese ships' movements in the \"Slot\", a strategic strait; American aircraft intercept and destroy the Japanese ships. When the Japanese Zeros strafe the Americans' position, Emile narrowly escapes, but Cable is killed.\n\nNellie learns of Cable's death and that Emile is missing. She realizes that she was foolish to reject Emile. Bloody Mary and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary explains that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile's espionage work has made it possible for a major offensive, Operation Alligator , to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.\n\nNellie spends time with Jerome and Ngana and soon comes to love them. While the children are teaching her to sing \"Dites-Moi\", suddenly Emile's voice joins them. Emile has returned to discover that Nellie has overcome her prejudices and has fallen in love with his children. Emile, Nellie and the children rejoice (\"Dites-Moi\" (reprise)).",

        "title": "Pocahontas (1995 film)",
        "description": "Pocahontas is a 1995 American animated musical historical drama film loosely based on the life of Powhatan woman Pocahontas and the arrival of English settlers from the Virginia Company . It was directed by Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg from a screenplay written by Carl Binder , Susannah Grant , and Philip LaZebnik . Produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation , the film romanticizes Pocahontas's encounter with John Smith and her legendary saving of his life.\n\nThe film stars the voices of Irene Bedard and Mel Gibson as Pocahontas and Smith, respectively, with David Ogden Stiers , Russell Means , Christian Bale , Michelle St. John , James Apaumut Fall, Billy Connolly , Joe Baker, Gordon Tootoosis , and Linda Hunt in supporting roles. The score was composed by Alan Menken , who also wrote the film's songs with lyricist Stephen Schwartz .\n\nAfter making his directorial debut with The Rescuers Down Under (1990), Gabriel conceived the film during a Thanksgiving weekend. Goldberg, who had just finished up work as the supervising animator of the Genie in Aladdin (1992), joined Gabriel as co-director. The project went into development concurrently with The Lion King (1994), and attracted most of Disney's top animators. Meanwhile, Disney studio chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg decided that the film should be an emotional romantic epic in the vein of Beauty and the Beast (1991), in hope that like Beauty , it would also be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture . Screenwriters Binder, Grant, and LaZebnik took creative liberties with history in an attempt to make the film palatable to audiences.\n\nPocahontas premiered at Central Park on June 10, 1995, and was released in the United States on June 16, to mixed reactions from critics and audiences, who praised its animation, voice performances, and music, but criticized its story with its lack of focus on tone. The film's historical inaccuracies and artistic license received polarized responses. Pocahontas earned over $346 million at the box office. The film received two Academy Awards for Best Musical or Comedy Score for Menken and Best Original Song for \" Colors of the Wind \". According to critics, the depiction of Pocahontas as an empowered heroine influenced subsequent Disney films like Mulan (1998) and Frozen (2013). The film was followed by a direct-to-video sequel, Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World , in 1998.",
        "synopsis": "In 1607, the Susan Constant travels from London to the New World , carrying English settlers from the Virginia Company. The settlers, including Captain John Smith , talk of adventure, finding gold, fighting \" Injuns \" and potentially settling in the new land. They encounter a hurricane shortly after setting sail, during which a soldier named Thomas washes overboard. John Smith manages to save him by rappelling off the ship, but they narrowly escape when the rope breaks.\n\nIn the Powhatan tribe in Virginia , Pocahontas , the pretty young Native American daughter of Chief Powhatan , fears being possibly wed to Kocoum, a warrior whom she sees as \"too serious\" for her own free-spirited personality. After having a dream about a spinning arrow, Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow, a talking willow tree who alerts her of the arriving English.\n\nThe voyage's leader Governor Ratcliffe , who seeks only wealth and status, has Jamestown built in a wooded clearing and immediately has the crewmen dig for gold, which he secretly plans to use to dethrone King James . John departs to explore the wilderness and encounters Pocahontas. At first, she speaks to him in Powhatan , but soon, he gains her trust. They quickly bond, fascinated by each other's worlds, and end up falling in love. After a fight between settlers and natives, Powhatan orders the natives to stay away from the Englishmen, but Pocahontas disobeys him and keeps meeting with John. However, Pocahontas's friend, Nakoma, discovers the secret relationship and warns Kocoum. Ratcliffe also learns of John's encounters and stubbornly warns him against sparing any Natives.\n\nLater, John and Pocahontas meet with Grandmother Willow and plan to bring peace between the colonists and the tribe. While both parties spy on the couple, John and Pocahontas share a kiss. Furious, Kocoum attacks and attempts to kill John, but Thomas, who had been ordered by Ratcliffe to follow John, intervenes and kills Kocoum. John orders Thomas to leave before the tribesmen arrive to capture the former and retrieve Kocoum's body. Enraged at Kocoum's death, Powhatan chastises Pocahontas for leaving the village, and declares war on the English, beginning with John's execution at dawn.\n\nReaching Jamestown, Thomas warns the settlers of John's capture. Ratcliffe then rallies his men to battle, using this as an excuse to annihilate the tribe and find their nonexistent gold. That same night, Powhatan also orders his men to prepare for battle. A desperate Pocahontas visits Grandmother Willow and realizes the arrow from John's compass is the same spinning arrow from her dream, which leads to her destiny. Morning comes, and Powhatan and his tribe drag John to a cliff for his execution. Meanwhile, Ratcliffe leads the armed colonists to fight Powhatan's warriors. Just as Powhatan is about to execute John and start the war, Pocahontas intervenes and finally convinces him to end the fighting between the two groups and spare John's life. Both sides stand down, and John is released, but an unmoved Ratcliffe fires his musket at Powhatan, but John takes the shot to save him. Furious, and despite Ratcliffe accusing John of taking the shot, the settlers turn on him and arrest him for hurting their comrade.\n\nJohn is nursed back to health by the tribe, but he must return to England for his wounds to fully heal. Ratcliffe is also sent back to face punishment for his crimes against the settlement. John asks Pocahontas to come with him, but she chooses to stay with her tribe to help keep the peace. John leaves without Pocahontas, but with Powhatan's blessing to return anytime in the future. At the end, Pocahontas stands atop a cliff, watching the ship carrying John depart.",

It is based on Isaac Bashevis Singer 's short story \"Yentl the Yeshiva Boy\".\n\nThe film incorporates music to tell the story of Yentl Mendel, an Ashkenazi Jewish woman in Poland in 1904 who decides to disguise herself as a man named Anshel so that she can receive an education in Talmudic law .

The film received the Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture\u2014Musical or Comedy and Best Director for Streisand, making her the first woman to win Best Director at the Golden Globes.",
        "synopsis": "Yentl Mendel is a woman living in an Ashkenazi shtetl named Yanev in Poland in 1904. Yentl's father, Reb Mendel (\u201cPapa\u201d), secretly instructs her in the Talmud despite the proscription of such study by women according to the custom of her community. Yentl refuses to be married off to a man.\n\nAfter the death of her father, Yentl decides to cut her hair short, dress like a man, take her late brother's name, Anshel, and enter a Yeshiva , a Jewish religious school in Bychawa . There she befriends a fellow student, Avigdor, and meets his fianc\u00e9e, Hadass Vishkower. Upon discovering that Avigdor lied about his brother's death (a suicide, not pneumonia or flu as Avigdor claimed), Hadass' family cancels the wedding over fears that Avigdor's family is tainted with insanity. Hadass' parents decide that she should marry \"Anshel\" instead, and Avigdor encourages \"Anshel\" to go ahead with the marriage, so Hadass can marry someone she knows rather than have a stranger for a husband. \"Anshel\" reluctantly marries Hadass so Avigdor will not leave town; the marriage remains unconsummated : \"Anshel\" claims it is a sin for a woman to give herself to a man while she loves another. \"Anshel\" starts to teach Hadass the Talmud. Meanwhile, Hadass develops romantic feelings for \"Anshel\", while Yentl herself is falling in love with Avigdor.\n\nYentl leaves for a trip to the city with Avigdor that will take him away from home for a few days. In their lodging in the city, Yentl finally reveals her true identity to Avigdor. At first, Avigdor does not believe his friend is a woman, but Yentl proves her womanhood by showing him her breasts. When a confused Avigdor asks her why she did not tell him, Yentl breaks down in his arms, showing she has revealed her real self to him out of love. Avigdor is stunned, but, after a moment, reciprocates the feeling  and remarks how beautiful Yentl's features are. The two kiss, but, Avigdor breaks away suddenly, remembering Hadass. Yentl assures him their marriage is not valid. Avigdor suggests he and Yentl elope. Yentl realizes that she will not be able to continue her studies if she marries Avigdor, and that she wants more from life than to be a wife. Yentl and Avigdor part ways, knowing they will always care for each other. It is implied that Hadass and \"Anshel\"'s marriage is annulled, as it was never consummated . Avigdor returns to marry Hadass. In the following scene, the two are successfully reunited and reading a letter from Yentl, learning that she is going to a new place and will love them both always. Yentl leaves Europe on a boat bound for the United States, where she hopes to lead a life with more freedom. With a smile on her face, Yentl finishes her story by singing: \"Papa, watch me fly.\"",

However, the underlying story is the same: a love triangle between the young Lucy Mannersly and the two men who fall in love with her, torn between their loyalties to her and to their native countries as they become caught up in the politics of the war-torn times they live in.",
        "synopsis": "Prologue\n\nThe opening song, \"Mirom Gospodu Pomolimsya\", sung by the whole company, sets the scene before a church in St. Petersburg in 1895. Dr. Manislav is summoned to the scene by Yana, the old servant of the villainous Count Irtenev. The Count has raped a young girl and Manislav has been summoned to help her. Appalled at the way people turn a blind eye to such crimes just because the perpetrator is one of the nobility, Dr. Manislav speaks out against the injustice (\"Testimony\") but is simply arrested and locked up for trying to speak out against the ruling classes.\n\nAct One\n\nThe scene changes to the East End of London eighteen years later, in 1913. The prostitutes Dulcie and Enid describe the squalor of the lives they lead (\"On Petticoat Lane\") when the rich young Lucy Mannersley emerges from a theatre with her ward and guardian, Peter Stryver. They bump into a friend of Stryver's, the lawyer Sydney Carton, who is familiar with Dulcie and Enid. Stryver tells Lucy that he has discovered that her father, Dr. Manislav, is still alive, in prison in St. Petersburg. Realising she must go and rescue him, Lucy prepares to set out for Russia with Stryver.\n\nIn St. Petersburg, the young student Kralena is thrown in prison for printing pamphlets inciting rebellion against the ruling classes. He vows that one day he shall see the workers take control, while Dr. Manislav, lying on the floor of the cell, reflects again on the injustice of his being silenced for trying to do the right thing (\"One Day...\") Lucy arrives with Stryver and arranges for her father's release, though Manislav seems to be delirious and doesn't recognise her. Kralena curses the aristocratic airs and graces of people like Lucy, and once they have gone, he again sings of how he shall one day seize power (\"One Day...Reprise\"). At the docks, a young peasant girl named Natalya sells her wares to the passing strangers, many of whom ignore her (\"Departures\"). However, one individual buys a locket from her. This man is Yevgeny Irtenev, the son of Count Irtenev. He explains to Yana that he has to leave to escape the anger of the working classes and says goodbye to her (\"Irtenev and Yana's Farewell\"). Lucy and Stryver, meanwhile, are having trouble with customs officials. Irtenev, posing as an Englishman named Edward Ireton, helps them to get past and onto the ship.\n\nAs the ship sets sail back to England, Lucy sings to her father, trying to calm him in his absent, delirious state. Yevgeny/Edward and the whole company join in the song as they will the boat on towards England (\"West and Safety Bound.\") Lucy later speaks to Edward on the boat, and he expresses fear about going to a strange place he does not know. Edward is then approached by a Russian woman named Tatiana, who tries to sell him counterfeit gems and precious jewels from his homeland of Russia, but Edward refuses to give in to such temptation (\"Precious Matryoshkas.\") The boat eventually arrives at the docks in Harwich, where Lucy again tries to comfort her father by singing (\"West and Safety Bound Reprise.\") Meanwhile, Tatiana reports Edward to a policeman, claiming he is a Russian spy. Edward pleads his innocence, but is taken away. Lucy resolves to help him.\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, Kralena arrives at an abandoned warehouse, where two of the Communist revolutionaries, Alexei and Sergei, welcome him to their dark world (\"The Night School of Subversion,\") asking him if he has what it takes. In the courtroom back in England, Sydney Carton arrives to defend Edward, apparently suffering from a dreadful cold. He questions Tatiana as to how she could be so certain that Edward was the man she thought he was, and she confesses not to know exactly what the spy she was looking for looks like. Throwing off his disguise, Sydney demonstrates that he bears an uncanny resemblance to Edward, thereby proving that it was easy for Tatiana to be mistaken in her assumption. Edward is released. Back in Russia, Alexei and Sergei take Kralena to the home of the local Police sergeant and urge him to blow the house up. Kralena is horrified but eventually does the horrific deed. Gleefully, the two revolutionaries welcome him to their movement (\"The Night School of Subversion Reprise.\") After the trial back in England, Lucy is very thankful to Sydney, and he feels an affection for her, but sees her obvious preference for Edward. Going home, Sydney sings sadly of the wasted life he has led pursuing women and always drinking, reflecting on the bleakness of his future. In St. Petersburg, Kralena joins the song, singing of how horrified he is at what he is done (\"At the Last Trumpet.\")\n\nThe next day at Dr. Manislav's house, Sydney arrives to help Manislav arrange his will. When Manislav hears that Edward's real name is Irtenev, he becomes delirious again and goes into a sort of fit. Sydney helps him and leads him outside. Left alone with Lucy, Edward confesses his feelings for her, and asks her to marry him. With time suddenly frozen, Lucy sings alone, imagining her life with Edward and weighing up the choice in her mind (\"Just Suppose.\") However, before she can tell Edward her decision, Sydney returns and breaks the tension. In Russia, meanwhile, Count Irtenev speaks to Yana, claiming that the talk of a revolution is just ridiculous rumours that will never come to fruition. He also expresses his deep disappointment in his son for fleeing the country. Back in England, Dr. Manislav plays chess with Stryver and explains his disapproval of the relationship between Lucy and Edward. Stryver sings back at him, making a case that they should not blame Edward for his father's faults (\"Bad Blood.\")\n\nBack again at the Irtenev estate, Count Irtenev catches a young, starving boy stealing from him and orders him to be thrown in the lake. The final scene is all enacted through the song \"Angelica, Arkangel\", sung by the whole company. Edward tells Lucy his memories of childhood, while Sydney sings with Dulcie, eventually deciding to give up his self-pity and move to Australia where he can find a new life. Dr. Manislav and Stryver again sing together of the \"bad blood\" inherent in Edward. Lucy marries Edward and Kralena instigates a revolution, culminating in the execution of rich nobles such as Count Irtenev.\n\nAct Two\n\nIn the streets of St. Petersburg in 1917, Kralena leading the people in revolution and smashing the world of the old elite (\"A New Russia.\") In England, Edward and Lucy are now married and have a daughter, Lily. Edward receives news from Yana telling of how his father has been killed and the revolutionaries have taken control. He tells Lucy that he must return to Russia to help. Kralena, meanwhile, has seized the Irtenev estate as his headquarters and sings \"One Day...Reprise\" as they capture Yana and force her to be their slave.\n\nEnid and Dulcie now sing and welcome us to the coastal resort of Paradise Sands (\"On Paradise Sands,\") singing of how soldiers come here on leave for a brief taste of happiness. Lucy and Stryver, who has been blinded fighting in the War, arrive and Lucy speaks bitterly of Edward's decision to return to Russia, claiming that \"that country robs me of my family.\" On a Baltic ferry towards Russia, Edward sings of his fears of what he may find when he returns home. Lucy, meanwhiles, bumps into Sydney on a train, who has come back to England to fight in the War. Joining in the song, Sydney confesses the love he has held for Lucy since he met her. She tells him that she is flattered, but cannot feel the same way, as she is married and has a daughter. As the song reaches its climax, Edward returns home to find the place a hellish nightmare, and Sydney and Lucy kiss (\"Home.\") They are disturbed by the arrival of Clusper, a major who knows Sydney. When Lucy has gone, Sydney decides to help Lucy in whatever way he can and asks Clusper to get him shipped out to Russia so he can rescue Edward for her.\n\nEdward arrives on the Irtenev estate and is immediately captured by Kralena and his men. He tries to plead his case that he is just a traveler, but when they threaten to kill Yana he confesses that he is indeed the son of Count Irtenev (\"Capture.\") Back at the English seaside, Lucy expresses concern for Edward, but Stryver stops her, telling her that he is sorry for all the times in the past that he upset or offended her. Meanwhile, the revolutionaries put Edward on trial (\"Trial & Testimony.\") He claims to be innocent, though Tatiana appears and levels accusations at him of being a foreign spy. Kralena summons the priest who was there when Dr. Manislav wrote his testimony, and reads it out as the words of Dr. Manislav explain the crimes of Edward's father. Condemned by Manislav's words, Edward despairs as he is led away to the old slaughter house to await execution.\n\nSydney arrives in St. Petersburg and pleads with the officer in charge to let him go into the city and find Edward. However, the officer forbids it, saying he must stay in the British Consulate and be on a troop ship in the morning. However, another soldier, Barker, feels sorry for Sydney, and agrees to lead him to the slaughter house to find his friend. Stopping outside the ruined church, Sydney encounters Yana, caring for an injured young boy, as the company sings \"Resurrection and Life.\" Back in England, Lucy asks her father to tell her about her childhood in Russia. Dr. Manislav refuses, saying that that life is far behind them and they must move on (\"Fairy Tales and Ghosts.\")\n\nSydney and Barker arrive at the slaughter house, where Edward and Natalya are kept prisoner. While Barker and the guard stay outside drinking, Sydney gets Natalya to help him switch clothes with Edward. Delirious, Edward barely recognises Sydney and leaves in a daze as the drunken Barker leads him out, believing him to be Sydney and taking him towards the troop ship. Left alone with Natalya, Sydney confesses that for the first time he feels he has done something honourable. Natalya sings to Sydney and explains her own tragic story (\"The Sorrow of my Fate\"). As the guards arrive to take Sydney to execution, he sings a reprise of \"Home\" that is taken up by the whole company as he is led away to be killed and Edward returns home to his wife and daughter.",

The show had its world premiere in 2008 at the Theatre Royal in Plymouth , as part of a ten-month UK tour, followed by a London West End run at the Shaftesbury Theatre .\n\nThe musical had a US tour in 2012\u20132014, but an expected Broadway run was postponed.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nPittsburgh, 1983.  On the floor of Hurley Steel, young steelworker Alexandra (\"Alex\") Owens welds while waiting impatiently for her shift to end (\"Steeltown Sky\").  She's anxious to get to Harry's Bar, a small club where she performs innovative, fashion-driven dances. On the mill floor, she catches the eye of Nick Hurley, the son of the mill owner, who decides he wants to learn more about her.\n\nEn route to the club, Alex meets up with her friend Gloria, who encourages Alex to pursue her dream of becoming a trained dancer in a legitimate company by applying to audition for the renowned Shipley Academy.  Alex decides to take the chance and asks the academy's administrator, Ms. Wilde, for an application (\"It's All in Reach\").\n\nAs Alex warms up to perform at Harry's, her good friends (and fellow dancers) Kiki, Tess and Gloria sing \"Maniac\".  Alex steps onto the club stage, and she is captivating.  After her performance, she is approached by Nick Hurley, but she rebuffs him, concerned about getting involved with her own boss.  In the dressing room, her girlfriends can't believe she'd turn down someone as attractive as Nick, but Alex sticks to her guns.  Gloria, who waits tables at Harry's but longs to perform, gets an education from the women in what inspires a \"flashdance\" (\"Put It On\").  But when the bar's owner, Harry, enters and complains that a new lap-dance joint called Chameleon \u2014 opened down the street by a shady entrepreneur named C.C. \u2014 is starting to siphon off his once-loyal customers, Alex realizes her days at Harry's may be numbered (\"It's All in Reach\" reprise).\n\nAnxious about her audition, Alex talks to her mom, who bolsters Alex's confidence about getting into Shipley (\"A Million to One\"). Alex reports to Shipley for a preliminary audition, but she is quickly intimidated by the accomplished, trained dancers all around her (\"Inside\").  She rushes out, crestfallen.(\"Steeltown Sky\" - Reprise)\n\nThe next day, Nick approaches Alex in the steel mill's lunchroom, but once again she rejects his advances.  Nick gets a playful jabbing from the steel men, who are happy to see him knocked off his pedestal (\"Justice\"). After they exit, he is approached by his secretary, who shows him a list of workers slated to be fired as the company starts to outsource its manufacturing.  Nick's affection (and respect) for Alex put him in a tough spot (\"Justice\" reprise).\n\nAt Harry's Bar, Gloria is hit on by C.C., the owner of the Chameleon Club. Nick, who is waiting at the club for another chance to talk to Alex, fends C.C. off.  Alex is impressed by Nick's chivalry and finally agrees to let him take her on a date. Gloria\u2019s cousin Jimmy admits that he has plans to go to New York to make it as a stand-up comic. Tess takes the stage at Harry's to perform a rousing interpretation of \"I Love Rock n' Roll.\"\n\nNick and Alex return to her place from their date and start to move past their assumptions about one another; she admits to her dream of attending Shipley, while he confesses that he is torn about the employees his family wants him to fire. They begin to fall in love (\"Here and Now\") and they sleep together for the first time:\n\nA few weeks later, Alex goes to her mom, holding an envelope from the Shipley Academy, and opens it to discover she has been called back for a final audition (\"My Next Step\").  Meanwhile, C.C. lures Gloria into working at the Chameleon, while Nick visits Ms. Wilde to thank her for letting Alex have a callback\u2014which he has paid for with a \"contribution\" to the academy.  Blissfully unaware of all this, Alex steps onto Harry's stage and dances exuberantly, finishing with an iconic blast of water from above (\"Maniac\" reprise).\n\n### Act 2\n\nAt the Chameleon Club, the girls perform lasciviously as Gloria \u2014 increasingly dependent on alcohol and cocaine \u2014 realizes she's gotten in too deep with C.C. (\"Chameleon Girl\").\n\nAlex and Nick, now very much in love, head off to face the day's challenges (\"Here and Now\" reprise).  Alex decides to forego attempting to dance classically for the judges in favor of something that expresses Alex's unique talent and style; Nick, meanwhile, prepares to plead his case against firing the steel workers (\"My Turn\").\n\nJimmy returns from New York, his dreams of becoming a famous stand-up comic quickly dashed.  He asks  Harry for his job back, and Harry, after some initial reluctance, agrees, glad to have Jimmy home (\"Where I Belong\").\n\nNick fails to convince his family they should hold onto the workers.  When Alex discovers that many of her friends at the plant are getting laid off, she and Nick argue, causing him to inadvertently admit he arranged her callback at Shipley. Alex walks out on him in a fury, leaving Nick to question his place in the company and his path in life (\"Enough\").\n\nKiki performs a flashdance to \"Manhunt\", as Harry continues to worry about C.C.'s growing success.  Alex, still upset from her fight with Nick and coping with learning the truth about her Shipley callback, discovers that Gloria \u2014 who she thought was away caring for a relative \u2014 has in fact been with C.C. at the Chameleon.  She rashly decides to go to Chameleon, rescuing Gloria (with some last-minute chivalry from none other than Jimmy).  Gloria and Jimmy reconcile (\"Where I Belong\" reprise).\n\nAlex decides to leave Pittsburgh and return to the small town where she grew up, despite having no real prospects there.  Nick appears and tries to dissuade her still (\"Hang On\"). She's insistent that their relationship has too many challenges to succeed.  But when Alex discovers that her mom has been shot during a robbery that Jimmy orchestrated, she finally confronts her own fears and makes the choice to reach for her dreams despite the odds (\"Try\").\n\nAlex arrives at Shipley just in time to audition, and despite falling at the beginning, her remarkable dance dispels the judges' initial skepticism (\"Flashdance \u2014 What a Feeling\").  Alex is given a place in the new semester; Nick enters with flowers, and Alex, forgiving the past and certain that her acceptance was based on her true talent, presents him with a rose from the bouquet before embracing him joyously.",

        "title": "The Rocky Horror Show",
        "description": "The Rocky Horror Show is a musical with music, lyrics and book by Richard O'Brien . A humorous tribute to various B movies associated with the science fiction and horror genres from the 1930s to the early 1960s, the musical tells the story of a newly engaged couple getting caught in a storm and coming to the home of a mad transvestite scientist, Dr Frank-N-Furter, unveiling his new creation, Rocky, a sort of Frankenstein-style monster in the form of an artificially made, fully grown, physically perfect muscle man .\n\nThe show was produced and directed by Jim Sharman . The original London production of the musical was premiered at the Royal Court Theatre (Upstairs) on 19 June 1973 (after two previews on 16 and 18 June 1973). It later moved to several other locations in London and closed on 13 September 1980. The show ran for a total of 2,960 performances in London and won the 1973 Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Musical. Songs in the musical include \" Time Warp \" and \" Sweet Transvestite \" (co-written by O'Brien and Richard Hartley ), while the costumes were designed by Sue Blane . Its 1974 debut in the US in Los Angeles had a successful nine-month run, but its 1975 Broadway debut at the Belasco Theatre lasted only three previews and forty-five showings, despite earning one Tony nomination and three Drama Desk nominations. Various international productions have since spanned across six continents as well as West End and Broadway revivals and eight UK tours. In 1991 it was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical Revival . Actor Tim Curry , who originated the role of Dr. Frank-N-Furter, became particularly associated with the musical.\n\nThe musical was adapted into the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show , starring O'Brien as Riff Raff, with Curry also reprising his role; the film has the longest-running release in film history. In 2016, it was adapted into the television film The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again . The musical was ranked eighth in a BBC Radio 2 listener poll of the \"Nation's Number One Essential Musicals\", and it was one of eight British musicals featured on a commemorative stamp issued by the Royal Mail in 2011.\n\nBeyond its cult status, The Rocky Horror Show is also widely said to have been an influence on countercultural and sexual liberation movements that followed on from the 1960s. It was one of the first popular musicals to depict fluid sexuality during a time of division between generations and a lack of sexual difference acceptance. Like the film adaptation, the musical is noted for a long-running tradition of audience participation through call-back lines and attending dressed up as characters from the show. On the 50th anniversary of the musical in 2023, BBC News states that since debuting in London in 1973 the \"production has been performed in 20 different languages\" and been \"seen by 30 million people globally\".",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe Usherette, sometimes referred to as \"Trixie\", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's \"film\" in a song (\" Science Fiction/Double Feature \"), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.\n\nAfter attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (\" Dammit Janet \") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr. Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (\" Over at the Frankenstein Place \").\n\nThe Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling \"apprehensive and uneasy\", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (\" Time Warp \"). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a pansexual , cross-dressing mad scientist , arrives. He introduces himself as \"a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania\" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (\" Sweet Transvestite \"). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.\n\nBrad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them laboratory coats to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (\"The Sword of Damocles\"). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (\"Charles Atlas Song\"/\"I Can Make You a Man\"). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (\" Hot Patootie \u2013 Bless My Soul \"). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky \u2014 the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain \u2014 that he prefers him over Eddie (\"Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)\"/\"I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)\"), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realising that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (\" Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me \"). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (\"Once in a While\"). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the paraplegic science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.\n\nDr. Scott in a wheelchair is wheeled into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr. Scott has connections with the FBI . Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (\"Eddie's Teddy\"). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (\"Planet Schmanet Janet\"); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a \"floor show\".\n\nUnder Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie ( \"Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)\" ). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in orgiastic sex (\"Don't Dream It \u2013 Be It\") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (\"Wild and Untamed Thing\"). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying ray guns . Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (\"Transit Beam\"). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (\" I'm Going Home \"). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.\n\nAs the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the \"Time Warp\" again with their fellow Transylvanians (\"Spaceship\"). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (\"Super Heroes\"). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says \"and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space \u2013 and meaning.\" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (\"Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)\").",

        "synopsis": "In 14th century Europe , King Stefan and Queen Leah welcome their newborn daughter, Aurora , and proclaim a holiday for their subjects to pay homage to the princess. At her christening , she is betrothed to Prince Phillip, the son of Stefan's friend King Hubert, in order to unite their kingdoms . The three good fairies , Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather , each bless Aurora with one gift. After Flora and Fauna give her beauty and song, the evil fairy Maleficent appears, angry at not being invited. She places a curse on Aurora: before the sun sets on Aurora's sixteenth birthday, Aurora will prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die. Merryweather's magic isn't strong enough to undo the curse, so she uses her gift to soften it so that Aurora will instead fall into a deep sleep until true love's kiss breaks the spell.\n\nStill fearful, Stefan orders all the kingdom's spinning wheels to be burned. Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather devise a plan to hide Aurora in a secluded location and raise her themselves until her sixteenth birthday, to which Stefan and Leah reluctantly agree. The fairies move into a forest cottage , giving up magic and living like human peasants ; they also rename Aurora to Briar Rose.\n\nOn Aurora's sixteenth birthday, the fairies send her to gather berries so they can prepare a surprise party. In the forest, Aurora sings to her animal friends, drawing the attention of Phillip, now a handsome young man. They fall in love without revealing their names, and Aurora invites Phillip to the cottage that evening. Meanwhile, Flora and Merryweather's argument about the color of Aurora's birthday gown attracts the attention of Maleficent's pet raven , Diablo. Aurora returns and tells her guardians that she has fallen in love. They reveal her true identity, which Diablo overhears, and tell her that she must never see the boy again. Meanwhile, Phillip tells his father about the girl he met and wants to marry, unaware she is the princess to whom he is betrothed. King Hubert unsuccessfully tries to dissuade him.\n\nShortly before sunset, the fairies bring Aurora to the castle for her birthday celebration. Maleficent appears as a glowing ball of light and hypnotically beckons Aurora to a tower room, where Aurora pricks her finger on a spindle of a spinning wheel that Maleficent conjures and falls into a deep sleep. The fairies place the sleeping Aurora in the highest tower, and put the entire kingdom to sleep until Aurora is awakened. While doing so, Flora overhears a conversation between Hubert and Stefan, and realizes that Phillip is the boy that Aurora met. The fairies rush to the cottage, only to discover that Phillip has been abducted by Maleficent.\n\nAt her domain, the Forbidden Mountain, Maleficent reveals Aurora's identity to Phillip. She plans to lock him away until he is an old man on the verge of death before releasing him to meet Aurora, who will not have aged a single day. The fairies rescue Phillip and arm him with the magical Sword of Truth and the Shield of Virtue. Maleficent surrounds Stefan's castle with a forest of thorns , but Phillip breaks through it. Outraged, she transforms into a giant, fire-breathing dragon , overpowering Phillip. The fairies enchant Phillip's sword, which he throws straight into Maleficent's heart, killing her.\n\nPhillip finds Aurora and awakens her with a kiss, bringing the rest of the kingdom out of their slumber. The two descend to the ballroom, where Aurora reunites with her parents and happily dances with Phillip as the good fairies look on with joy.",

Based on the romantic novel La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias by Alexandre Dumas, fils , the musical updates the story to 1940s German-occupied Paris . It tells the tale of a 40-year-old ex-singer and her affair with a young musician who is mixed up with the French Resistance , whilst she is the mistress of a Nazi officer.",
        "synopsis": "### Prologue\n\nAugust 25, 1944 . The citizens of Paris sing about Marguerite, who was once a well-known lady of Parisian society (\"Come One Come All\") but who is now the lover of a German officer.\n\n### Act I\n\nMarch 3, 1942. It is Marguerite's 40th birthday and she is celebrating with her friends, who are living in blissful ignorance of the war (\"Let the World Turn\"). As dinner is served, Marguerite's former talent agent , Georges, brings a band in. The band consists of Armand, his sister Annette, her boyfriend Lucien and their friend Pierrot. Annette, Lucien and Pierrot are members of the resistance . Armand recalls seeing Marguerite sing years before, and being captivated. Marguerite is delighted to learn that they are a swing band and encourages everyone to leave the table and dance while Annette sings \"Jazz Time\". Marguerite becomes flirtatious with all of the men, which enrages her lover, Otto. Armand attempts to calm the situation by playing \"China Doll,\" Marguerite's biggest hit, and Marguerite is persuaded to sing.\n\nAn air raid siren sounds and a distant explosion shakes the room. Everyone runs off to the shelter except for Marguerite. Armand is the last to leave and the two are left alone. Armand tells Marguerite that he knows that she only pretends to be happy, and Marguerite confesses that she does not love Otto. As they move towards each other, a bomb shatters the French windows and the electricity goes out. Marguerite and Armand share a passionate kiss as the all-clear siren sounds (\"China Doll (Reprise)\"). The guests return, shaken but unharmed. Armand leaves, and Marguerite promises to meet him the next day.\n\nIn her bedroom, Marguerite reflects on her feelings for Armand (\"The Face I See\"). Otto enters and tries to confess his love for her, but she changes the subject. Otto becomes enraged and reminds her that even if she doesn't love him, she is still his mistress.\n\nThe next day, the band members reflect on the changing state of Paris, while Armand sings of his new passion for Marguerite (\"Time Was When\"). A Nazi band is playing at the same bandstand and the crowd joins in (\"The World Begins Today\"). Armand waits for Marguerite (\"Waiting\") but when she does arrive it is only to tell him that their relationship can never be.\n\nLucien and Annette are at home listening to coded radio messages when they hear that the French government will force Jews to wear an identifying mark . This worries Lucien as he is Jewish. Annette says she will speak to her resistance contact about leaving Paris. Pierrot arrives, carrying various food items that he had stolen from the party. When Pierrot leaves, he is stopped by the police. They discover the stolen food in his bag and send him away to a concentration camp .\n\nArmand sings of his love for Marguerite (\"Intoxication\"). The song becomes a trio between Armand, Marguerite and Otto.\n\nAt the concentration camp, Pierrot is tortured (\"Day by Day (Part One)\"). He manages to buy his way out of trouble by giving the Nazis the name and address of a Jew \u2013 Lucien.\n\nAnnette goes to see Armand. She has train tickets and wants him to leave Paris with her. Lucien bursts in and explains the situation - he must leave Paris at once. While Armand packs his bags, Marguerite comes to his flat and they make love (\"I Am Here\").\n\nThat night, Annette and Lucien wait for Armand at the train station. Lucien leaves, but Annette stays behind, promising to join him later (\"Take Good Care of Yourself\").\n\n### Act II\n\nMarguerite and Armand meet in a park, as the crowd sing of change (\"Day by Day (Part Two)\"). Otto calls upon Hermann, a fellow Nazi officer, to have Marguerite followed. Marguerite goes to see Armand (\"Dreams Shining Dreams\"). She tells him that she must leave early because Otto has invited guests. He becomes angry and throws her love letters all over his flat. They reconcile and plan to leave Paris. Marguerite leaves to go home to grab her belongings.\n\nAnnette meets her resistance contact, Saurel, who gives her a briefcase full of documents and tells her to smuggle them out of Paris. He warns her that Armand is having an affair with a Nazi officer's lover, making him a danger to her and himself. This worries Annette (\"Take Good Care of Yourself (Reprise)\"). Annette goes to Armand's flat, arriving at the same time as Hermann, who captures her after finding incriminating documents in her bag.\n\nOtto is sitting in a darkened room with Marguerite's love letters, singing about his feelings (\"I Hate the Very Thought of Women\"). When Marguerite arrives home, he confronts her with the letters. Hermann brings in Annette, who is covered in cuts and bruises. Otto promises to stop torturing Annette if Marguerite writes a letter to Armand saying that she will never see him again. Marguerite complies, hoping that Armand will understand (\"The Letter\"). Armand reads the letter and is distraught (\"What\u2019s Left of Love\"). Pierrot arrives with an undercover Lucien. Lucien, furious at Armand for putting Annette in danger, enlists him to take a new job that Saurel has arranged from an unknown contact: the assassination of Otto.\n\nThere is a big New Year's Eve masquerade party and the chanteuse sings (\"Paris\"). Marguerite accompanies Otto, against her will. Armand, Lucien and Pierrot attend, disguising themselves as the band. As the fireworks ring in the new year, Armand shoots Otto dead. The crowd sing of change again (\"Day by Day (Part Three)\").\n\nWithout Otto to support her, Marguerite visits Georges and asks him to help her find work as a singer, but he refuses. He confesses that he had only pretended to be her friend so that he could mingle with the upper class. Distraught, Marguerite leaves (\"How Did I Get to Where I Am?\").\n\nParis is liberated (\"Day by Day (Part Four)\"), and the French turn on the Nazi sympathizers. Armand, Lucien and Pierrot watch as the crowds celebrate their newly liberated city. The boys tell Armand that Annette has been freed and is recovering. They reveal to him that Marguerite made a bargain with Otto in order to save Annette and Armand's lives...and that she was the one who tipped the Resistance off that Otto would be at the New Year's Eve party.

        "description": "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is a musical with a book by Joseph Fields and Anita Loos , lyrics by Leo Robin , and music by Jule Styne , based on the best-selling 1925 novel of the same name by Loos. The story involves an American woman's voyage to Paris to perform in a nightclub.\n\nThe musical opened on Broadway in 1949 (running for 740 performances and introducing Carol Channing ), a London production was mounted in 1962, and there was a Broadway revival in 1995. It was made into a 1953 film of the same name , starring Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe . The popular songs \"Bye Bye Baby\" and \" Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend \" were introduced in this musical. An adaptation called Lorelei (also starring Carol Channing) was performed on Broadway in 1974.",
        "synopsis": "In the 1920s, Lorelei Lee, a blonde from Little Rock, Arkansas , and her friend Dorothy Shaw board the ocean liner Ile de France , to embark for France (\"It's High Time\"). Lorelei and her boyfriend, Gus Esmond, are parting for a while (\"Bye, Bye Baby\"); Gus is going to Little Rock, and Dorothy is Lorelei's chaperone. On the ship, Lorelei has many admirers, including the rich Philadelphian Henry Spofford III, and an Englishman, Sir Francis (Piggy) Beekman. Lorelei is worried that Gus will find out about an old secret of hers and break off their engagement (\"I'm Just A Little Girl From Little Rock\"), and she is afraid to open a wire that she receives from him.\n\nMeanwhile, Dorothy flirts with a group of olympic sportsmen (\"I Love What I'm Doing (When I'm Doing It For Love)\"). Lorelei disapproves of this as the Olympians are poor; she is sure that Gus has broken up with her and tells Dorothy that they need to find some rich men. Lorelei chooses the zipper king, Josephus Gage. For Dorothy she chooses Henry Spofford. Lady Beekman is trying to sell her tiara to an American. Lorelei wishes to buy it, but does not have the money, so she decides to persuade Sir Francis to lend her the money (\"It's Delightful Down In Chile\").\n\nOn arrival in Paris, Dorothy and Henry are becoming attracted to each other (\"Sunshine\"). Two French detectives, Robert and Louie Lemanteur, are looking for Lorelei, trying to recover Lady Beekman's tiara. They don't speak much English, but they fall for the charms of the girls and offer to take them out. Josephus Gage arrives with Lorelei, wearing the first French dress to use a zipper. It is suggested that everyone have cocktails, to Mrs Spofford's delight, but Josephus does not drink, instead eating raw carrots (\"I'm a Tingle I'm Aglow\"). Henry, left alone with Dorothy, proposes marriage (\"You Say You Care\"), but she says that she is not good enough for him.\n\nGus arrives suddenly and discovers that Lorelei is dating Josephus. His father has always disapproved of Lorelei. Gus retaliates by dating Gloria Stark, a dancer, promising to make her a star.\n\nEveryone is at a Paris club. Lady Beekman and the two detectives are still trying to recover her tiara. Sir Francis is there with two ladies. Lorelei and Dorothy are there with Josephus and Henry. Gus arrives and nearly comes to blows with Josephus. The floor show includes performances by Gloria (\"Mamie Is Mimi\") and Coquette. After Lorelei walks around the streets of Paris reflecting singing (\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend\"). Gus tells Lorelei that he loves her so much that he would leave his father's business for her sake. She admits that she shot a man in Little Rock, but it was in self-defense (the man was attempting to rape her), so she was acquitted; they make up.\n\nThe Americans miss the United States (\"Homesick Blues\") and go home. Lorelei delays marrying Gus until his father accepts her. Mrs. Spofford gives Dorothy some advice (\"Keeping Cool with Coolidge\"). Gus's father, Mr. Esmond, arrives and finds that Lorelei is wearing a dress covered in his buttons and that she knows everything about his business (\"Button Up with Esmond\"). He is impressed and approves of the marriage.",

        "description": "It Shoulda Been You is a musical with music by Barbara Anselmi and book and lyrics by Brian Hargrove . The musical ran on Broadway from March 17, 2015 (previews) to August 9, 2015. The musical involves a wedding which brings together the families who are quite, and comically, different.",
        "synopsis": "At the St. George Hotel, it is the morning of Rebecca Steinberg and Brian Howard's wedding. Jenny, Rebecca's sister, talks of her nerves before the wedding and how glad she is that she isn't the one having to have all the problems of a bride (\"I Never Wanted This\"). Judy and Murray are Jenny and Rebecca's parents. Judy, an overbearing, talkative Jewish mother, barks commands at Jenny to make sure things are organized. While trying to keep things together, Jenny accidentally calls Rebecca's ex, Marty, and lets it slip the wedding is taking place that day. Marty is convinced that it is a sign that he needs to stop the wedding and talk Rebecca out of it. He rushes to the hotel.\n\nThe bride and groom share their mutual excitement and fears (\"This Day (Opening)\"). Things go well with a few comedic missteps, including the visible impact of the wedding on the groom's mother, Georgette, who doesn't want to lose her son to another woman. When things seem to settle, the best man, Greg, comes in and announces that Rebecca wants to stop the wedding. Jenny rushes to her side, and Rebecca says that there's a smudge on her wedding dress\u2014it must be a sign.\n\nAnnie, the \"co-maid of honor\", tries to talk to her along with Brian and Greg, until Brian insinuates that Annie has been too controlling over the wedding. That triggers something in Annie, and she runs off with Greg and Brian immediately rushing after her to apologize. Jenny once again smoothes over the situation by getting the stain out of the dress. Rebecca and Jenny sing about how much they admire each other, both seeing qualities in the other that they respect (\"Perfect\"). On the other side of the hotel, Marty arrives and is instantly spotted by Murray, who expresses his joy over seeing him before. Murray admits that he wishes it were Marty marrying Rebecca instead of Brian. He is joined by Judy, the drunken Uncle Morty, and flirtatious Aunt Sheila, who all echo this sentiment (\"It Shoulda Been You\").\n\nWhen Jenny sees Marty, she tries to get him to leave. However, Marty appeals to their longtime friendship and all the times that he has been there for her. Jenny reminisces with him, and it's revealed they did get together, but for some reason Marty stopped calling her and she never knew why (\"Who\"). She reluctantly agrees to give him only a few short minutes with Rebecca. Meanwhile, Brian is having a few moments with George, his father. George says that now that Brian is getting married, he wants to try to have a closer relationship with him\u2014something he and his own father never had (\"Back in the Day\"). He also gives Brian a pre-nuptial agreement and tells him to consider signing it before the wedding, completely unaware that Marty is hiding behind a plant and has heard their conversation.\n\nThe bridal party gets their hair and makeup done, and tensions between the conservative Christian Georgette and open Jewish Judy are running high. Rebecca and Jenny beg Judy to be polite. After Georgette, assuming a cheerful tone, takes a few back-handed jabs at her, Judy emulates her demeanor to hurl shots back at her, including pointing out Georgette's latest face lift (\"Nice\").\n\nMarty arrives and throws everything into disarray when he announces the plans for the pre-nuptial agreement. Rebecca is shocked and runs off. Everyone goes to find her. Jenny starts panicking that the wedding will be over before it has begun. She is reassured by Albert, the wedding planner, that all will be well. He shares stories of all the weddings he's been involved in, pointing out that nothing has ever shocked him or prevented the ceremony from taking place, including that a wedding day pre-nuptial agreement is not legally binding (\"Albert's Turn\").\n\nBrian tries to confide in Georgette and tells her that he owes everything he has achieved in life to her. As he leaves, Georgette laments losing her son to another woman and wishes he had turned out gay, or at least waited until after she died to find someone (\"Where Did I Go Wrong?\"). Everyone is still searching for Rebecca; they think she has left, but Albert appears with Rebecca dressed, made up, and ready to walk down the aisle. Judy and Murray admire her, and Judy tells Jenny to go get dressed. As she goes into the bathroom, Judy compliments Rebecca on how stunning she looks before saying she wishes Jenny had found someone. Judy suggests that it would be easier for Jenny to find someone if she lost weight. Rebecca retorts that this isn't fair, as Jenny has had a wonderful life and has done great things. Jenny hears this conversation as she exits the bathroom and is embarrassed. Everyone else leaves, and Jenny finishes dressing. As she does this, she expresses her frustration that even though she views herself as a truly beautiful and valuable person, she struggles to find people that view her as more than 'sort of pretty,' 'kind of sexy,' or just 'nice' (\"Beautiful\").\n\nOutside the cathedral, Marty shows up one more time to try to convince Rebecca to call off the wedding. Rebecca considers it, but Jenny steps in and tells him to let Rebecca go and be happy. Marty reluctantly agrees, and the wedding goes ahead.\n\nAfter the wedding, everyone gets ready for the reception. Murray and Judy rejoice that their daughter is finally married. Georgette is in despair and grabs George to head for the bar. Jenny is happy for her sister, but sad for herself. Rebecca and Brian, now in a private room, are just glad things went ahead (\"A Perfect Ending\"). Greg and Annie interrupt the newlyweds' alone time with champagne in hand to celebrate. They drink, and it is revealed that Greg and Brian are lovers as well as Annie and Rebecca. Jenny and Albert walk in and catch the two couples in the act. Rebecca tries to explain things to Jenny, but she is interrupted by Judy telling them the reception is about to start.\n\nAt the reception, Greg and Annie perform a garish song to their secret lovers declaring their undying devotion under the pretense of having written it for the wedding (\"Love you Till the Day\"). Rebecca tries to talk to Jenny again, but she is interrupted by Judy, who says it's time for the father-daughter dance. Rebecca tries to resist, but Judy says Jenny can use the dance to search for a husband. That finally sets Jenny off, and she storms away. Judy follows her and tries to see what's the matter while still giving her orders about details of the wedding, but Jenny has none of it. She decides that she's tired of being pushed around and mocked; she's going to have a quick fling and throw caution to the wind (\"Jenny's Blues\"). Marty comes in and she impulsively kisses him. Jenny runs off after she kisses him, but Marty follows her into the bathroom and presses her to explain why she kissed him. She denies it as anything serious, but Marty continues pushing before letting it slip that he knew Rebecca was gay and that's why he couldn't call Jenny back. He didn't trust himself not to tell her after he promised Rebecca he wouldn't. He then says that he never loved Rebecca, but he always loved Jenny. He continues, saying that if she wants him, he wants to start a romantic relationship or whatever she wants (\"Whatever\"). The two declare their feelings for each other and kiss. Albert comes in and says that Rebecca is about to tell Judy and Murray that she's gay. They run off to find her. However, what they don't realize is that Aunt Sheila was also in the bathroom (hooking up with a busboy) and has heard the whole thing.\n\nBrian and George try to talk Rebecca out of revealing her sexuality on the day of the wedding. Jenny and Marty concur, but Rebecca says she's tired of living a lie. She wants to be who she is and wants to be with whom she loves (\"A Little Bit Less Than\"). Jenny hugs Rebecca and tells her she is strong. Judy and Murray come in to tell them the speeches are about to begin. Rebecca tries to get up the nerve to tell them but ultimately chickens out. As the rest of the family comes in, Aunt Sheila drunkenly announces that Rebecca is gay and, to the delight of Georgette, Brian also confesses his sexuality.\n\nJudy and Marty are shocked and demand an explanation for why they went through with the wedding. Brian and Rebecca explain that they both met in college, and when they found out that each other was gay, they became close friends. As they, along with Annie and Greg, hit 30 they realized they were broke. Brian remembered that he had a trust fund in his name from his grandfather's will. However, the stipulation was that he had to be married to a woman, so he convinced Rebecca to marry him. Rebecca also reveals that she is pregnant with Brian's child as during a period of time when she struggled with her sexuality, she and Brian had a drunken fling. After they got over the shock, Annie and Greg accept it, and they all decided to raise the child together. To the delight of Rebecca and Brian, both of their parents are accepting of their sexuality. Judy and Murray are overjoyed that they will have a grandchild, and Georgette and George take glee in the fact that Brian's grandfather\u2014a racist homophobe\u2014would have hated it.\n\nHowever, the wedding isn't over. Marty proposes to Jenny, saying he has been in love with her his whole life. Jenny says it is too soon, being that they never even dated. Judy convinces her, saying that she should go for it if she truly loves Marty. She says that love isn't about fairy tales\u2014it takes time, and it involves taking risks and having the little moments that make a relationship come together (\"What They Never Tell You\").\n\nJenny and Marty both admit they have flaws, but they love each other, so it doesn't matter (\"Perfect/Whatever\" Reprise). Jenny says she doesn't have a dress, but Albert has it covered and hurries her off to get ready. Spurred by this quick wedding, Brian proposes to Greg and Rebecca to Annie, and they hurry off to make it a triple ceremony. With both sets of parents now alone together, they reflect over the events of the day, with the two mothers putting aside their differences because they are becoming a family (\"That's Family\").\n\nJenny emerges in her dress, and Judy says she looks beautiful. Marty happily agrees and the two marry (\"Finale\").",

        "description": "Pink Floyd \u2013 The Wall is a 1982 British live-action/animated musical surrealist drama film directed by Alan Parker , based on Pink Floyd 's 1979 studio album The Wall . The screenplay was written by Pink Floyd vocalist and bassist Roger Waters , with animation sequences directed by Gerald Scarfe . The Boomtown Rats ' lead vocalist Bob Geldof made his film debut as rock star Pink, who, driven to neurosis by the pressures of stardom and traumatic events in his life, constructs an emotional and mental wall to protect himself. However, this coping mechanism eventually backfires, and Pink demands to be set free.\n\nLike its associated album, the film is highly metaphorical , and frequently uses both visual and auditory symbolism throughout. It features little dialogue, instead being driven by the music from the album throughout. The songs used in the film have several differences from their album versions, and two of the songs included, \" When the Tigers Broke Free \" and \" What Shall We Do Now? \", do not appear on the album. Despite its turbulent production, the film received generally positive reviews, with praise for its music and animation, and it has an established cult following among Pink Floyd fans.",
        "synopsis": "Pink ( Bob Geldof ) is a depressed rock star who appears motionless and expressionless while remembering his father. Decades prior, in Pink's infancy, his father was killed defending the Anzio beachhead during World War II , leaving Pink's overbearing mother to raise him alone. A young Pink discovers relics from his father's military service and death. An animation depicts the brutality of war. Pink places a bullet on the track of an oncoming train within a tunnel, and the train that passes has cattle-trucks full of children peering out of the windows wearing expressionless face masks.\n\nAt school, he is caught writing poems and is humiliated by the teacher, who reads a poem from Pink's book before disciplining him. However, it is revealed that the poor treatment of the students is because of the unhappiness of the teacher's strained marriage. Pink recalls an oppressive school system, imagining children falling into a meat grinder. He fantasises about the children rising in rebellion and burning down the school before throwing the teacher onto a bonfire.\n\nAs an adult, Pink remembers his overprotective mother and his strained marriage. During a phone call, Pink realises that his wife is cheating on him when a man answers the phone. His traumatic experiences are represented as \"bricks\" in the wall he constructs around himself that emotionally isolates him.\n\nPink returns to his hotel room with a groupie, only to destroy the room in a fit of violence, scaring her away. Depressed, he thinks about his wife and feels trapped in his room. He then remembers every \"brick\" of his wall, as it is shown to be finally complete, and the film returns to the first scene.\n\nNow trapped inside his wall, Pink does not leave his hotel room and begins to lose his mind to metaphorical \"worms\". He shaves all his body hair and watches television, particularly the epic docudrama war film The Dam Busters (1955). The young Pink searches through the trenches of the war, eventually finding himself as an adult. Young Pink runs away in terror and appears at a railway station, with the soldiers being reunited with their loved ones, but failing to find his father. In the present, Pink's manager finds him in his hotel room, unresponsive, and has a paramedic inject him with drugs to enable him to perform.\n\nIn this drugged-out state, Pink hallucinates himself as a fascist dictator and his concert as a neo-Nazi rally in London. His followers attack black people, gays, and Jews. He imagines marching hammers goose-stepping across ruins. Pink stops hallucinating and screams, \"Stop!\", deciding he no longer wants to be trapped behind the wall. He cowers in a bathroom stall, quietly singing to himself as a security guard walks past him. As an animated rag doll , Pink puts himself on trial for \"showing feelings of an almost human nature\". His teacher and wife both accuse and berate him for his actions, while his mother tries to take him home, because she doesn't want him to get in any trouble.\n\nAs judge, Pink sentences himself \"to be exposed before his peers\", and gives the order to \"tear down the wall!\". Following a prolonged silence, the wall is destroyed, and Pink screams in terror. While Pink's ultimate fate is left unknown, children can be seen cleaning up a pile of debris and grabbing bricks, with one of them emptying a Molotov cocktail .",

After Rabbit separates from Pooh and Piglet due to a disagreement on how to escape, the latter two manage to find their way out of the forest on their own before running into Tigger, who had already found his way out. Upon learning from Pooh and Piglet that Rabbit is still in the forest, Tigger returns to rescue Rabbit and lead him out of the forest, much to the latter's humiliation.\n\nSometime later, during the first snowfall of winter , Tigger and Roo spend the day together. As the two travel through the forest, they decide to bounce up to the top of a tall tree, which they succeed in doing, but upon reaching the top, Tigger becomes too frightened to come down. Pooh and Piglet soon discover Tigger and Roo in the tree and recruit Christopher Robin , Roo's mother, Kanga , and Rabbit to help get them down. Roo manages to make it down safely by jumping onto Christopher Robin's coat, but a still-frightened Tigger refuses to jump and promises never to bounce again should he be released from his predicament, thrilling Rabbit. To help Tigger, the Narrator tips over the book to allow Tigger to slide down unharmed.\n\nTigger's joy to be back on the ground turns into depression when Rabbit reminds him of his promise. Feeling sorry for Tigger, his friends call out and remind Rabbit of the joy Tigger had brought with his bouncing, causing Rabbit to realize how very selfish and jerky he's been and takes back the promise they had agreed on. An overjoyed Tigger then invites Rabbit to bounce with him, which Rabbit, much to his own surprise, greatly enjoys.

The Tramp is also the title of a silent film starring Chaplin, which Chaplin wrote and directed in 1915.\n\nThe Tramp, as portrayed by Chaplin is a childlike and bumbling but generally good-hearted character who is most famously portrayed as a mischievous vagrant . He endeavours to behave with the manners and dignity of a gentleman despite his actual social status. However, while the Tramp is ready to take what paying work is available, he also uses his cunning self to get what he needs to survive and escape the authority figures who will not tolerate his antics.\n\nChaplin's films did not always portray the Tramp as a vagrant, however. The character (\"The little fellow\", as Chaplin called him) was rarely referred to by any names on-screen, although he was sometimes identified as \"Charlie\" and rarely, as in the original silent version of The Gold Rush , \"The little funny tramp\".",

        "description": "Raggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure is a 1977 live-action/animated musical fantasy film loosely adapted from the 1924 novel Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees . It was directed by Richard Williams , produced by the Bobbs-Merrill Company , and released theatrically by 20th Century Fox . A 1941 short film had previously featured the Raggedy Ann and Andy characters created by Johnny Gruelle . The first feature-length animated musical comedy produced in the United States , the plot follows Raggedy Ann and Andy, who, along with other toys, live in the nursery of a little girl named Marcella. During Marcella's seventh birthday, Babette, from France , is introduced as the new doll from a large package. Meanwhile, the lecherous Captain Contagious kidnaps Babette in his pirate ship and escapes from the nursery. Ann and Andy must explore and find Babette in the Deep Deep Woods to save her.\n\nThe film began development when producer Richard Horner chose the characters from a conversation surrounding promotions of children's products. The Bobbs-Merrill Company became its financer, and the film was a stage musical and a live-action television special before it was decided to become an animated film . Director Williams controlled most of production, which lasted for more than two years, budgeting to the cost of $4 million. As a result, the release date was pushed back for an extra three months of work. Joe Raposo contributed all of the music and songs for the film. The film's promotional campaign cost $2 million.\n\nRaggedy Ann & Andy: A Musical Adventure premiered on March 20, 1977, in nine major cities before it was generally released on April 1, 1977, in the United States. It received mixed reviews, with much of the praise going to the animation. Ever since its release, the film only gained a few home video releases and some television broadcasts. The film was adapted by the 1981 drama adaptation and the 1986 Broadway musical, Raggedy Ann . In recent years, it has developed a cult following for its songs and characters.",
        "synopsis": "Marcella returns home and goes to her nursery playroom to put away her favorite doll, Raggedy Ann . When Marcella leaves, the toys come to life, and Ann tells them of the wonders of the outside world. She then shares that it is Marcella's seventh birthday, and the toys notice a large package in the corner. Marcella opens the present to reveal a beautiful bisque doll from Paris , France , named Babette. Ann and the other toys welcome Babette, but she is too homesick. Meanwhile, Captain Contagious notices Babette and he becomes immediately smitten. After tricking Ann into freeing him, he kidnaps Babette with his band of pirates and leaps out of the nursery window. Ann and Andy decide to rescue Babette.\n\nAnn and Andy enter the Deep Deep Woods. As the dolls travel, they meet the Camel with the Wrinkled Knees, a blue stuffed animal who has been abandoned and hallucinates ghostly camels beckoning him to a home. Ann promises that once they find Babette, he may return with them. With Ann and Andy in tow, the Camel chases down the caravan and mindlessly rushes off a cliff. They find themselves in the Taffy Pit, where the Greedy lives. The Greedy explains that he feels unsatisfied despite endlessly eating. He thus attempts to take the candy heart inside Ann, but the toys successfully escape.\n\nThe toys then encounter the looniest knight Sir Leonard Looney, who welcomes them to Looney Land. Looney pursues the toys into the court of its monarch, King Koo Koo. Koo Koo laments his tiny stature and explains that he can only grow by laughing at other persons. He thus intends to keep the toys as his prisoners. The dolls escaped and slipped away in a boat. The furious king follows them with an enormous sea monster , Gazooks; since there's no bigger laugh for him than seeing the good guys \"get it,\" he's eager to achieve \"the last laugh\" by having Gazooks tickle all the heroes with his many arms.\n\nWhile sailing, Ann, Andy, and the Camel notice Contagious' ship, only to discover that Babette had become the new captain while imprisoning Contagious. When Ann tries to tell Babette to return, Babette is enraged and has the trio tied to the mast. Meanwhile, Contagious' shackles were successfully unlocked by Queasy and he returns above deck, freeing the others and pledging his love for Babette. King Koo Koo and Gazooks then attacked the ship and seize all but Ann, Babette, and subjects them to tickling, making the monarch swell to mammoth proportions by laughing. Babette begs for forgiveness, only for her and Ann to be captured and tickled. The dolls realize that King Koo Koo's inflated ego is \"full of hot air,\" and Andy tells Queasy to pop him, which creates a massive explosion that sends them spiraling.\n\nThe following day, Marcella discovers the toys lying her backyard. She returns all but the Camel, where Babette apologizes for her actions and accepts Ann's offer of friendship and Contagious' affection. While the heroes are contented, Ann notices the Camel through the window. The dolls welcome him to their family. The next day, Marcella finds the Camel among the dolls and hugs him tightly, accepting him.",

It was inspired by the French pointillist painter Georges Seurat 's painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (painted 1884\u20131886). The plot revolves around George, a fictionalized version of Seurat, who immerses himself deeply in painting his masterpiece, and his great-grandson (also named George), a conflicted and cynical contemporary artist. The Broadway production opened in 1984.\n\nThe musical won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama , two Tony Awards for design (and a nomination for Best Musical), numerous Drama Desk Awards , the 1991 Olivier Award for Best Musical, and the 2007 Olivier Award for Outstanding Musical Production. It has enjoyed several major revivals, including the 2005\u20132006 UK production first presented at the Menier Chocolate Factory , its subsequent 2008 Broadway transfer, and a 2017 Broadway revival.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn 1884, Georges Seurat , known as George in the musical, is sketching studies for his painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte . He announces to the audience, \"White, a blank page or canvas. The challenge: bring order to the whole, through design, composition, tension, balance, light and harmony.\" He conjures up the painting's setting, a small suburban park on an island, and retains some control of his surroundings as he draws them. His longtime mistress, Dot, models for him, despite her frustration at having to get up early on a Sunday (\"Sunday in the Park with George\").\n\nMore park regulars begin to arrive: a quarrelsome Old Lady and her Nurse discuss how Paris is changing to accommodate a tower for the International Exposition, but the Nurse is more interested in a German coachman, Franz. The quiet of the park is interrupted by a group of rude bathers. George freezes them with a gesture, making them the subjects of his first painting, Bathers at Asni\u00e8res .\n\nThe setting abruptly changes to a gallery where the painting is on display. Jules (a more successful artist friend of George's) and his wife Yvonne think George's work has \"No Life\". Back on the island, Jules and Yvonne have a short discussion with George and depart. They take their coachman Franz with them, interrupting his rendezvous with the Nurse. Dot, who has grown tired of standing still in the early morning sunlight, leaves the park mollified after George promises to take her to the Follies . George approaches the Old Lady, revealed to be his mother, and asks to draw her, but she bluntly refuses.\n\nIn his studio, George works on his painting obsessively while Dot prepares for their date and fantasizes about being a Follies girl (\"Color and Light\"). When George briefly stops painting to clean his brushes, he and Dot reflect on how fascinated they are by each other. Dot is ready to leave, but George chooses to continue painting instead, greatly upsetting her.\n\nIn the park on a Sunday some time later, George sketches a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters on the arm of Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man (\"Gossip\"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write.\n\nAs Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday (\"The Dog Song\").\n\nAs the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park (\"The Day Off\"): The two Celestes try to attract the attention of a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke the artists' condescending attitude.\n\nDot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation, she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice (\"Everybody Loves Louis\").\n\nAs the park empties for the evening, George returns. He misses Dot and laments that his art has alienated him from those important to him, but resigns himself to the likelihood that creative fulfillment may always take precedence for him over personal happiness (\"Finishing the Hat\").\n\nTime has passed, and a heavily pregnant Dot visits George's studio. She asks for a painting George made of her, but he refuses. Jules and Yvonne come to the studio to see George's nearly finished painting. While Jules goes with George to see the painting, Yvonne and Dot hold a wary conversation. They realize they have both felt neglected by an artist, their mutual dislike fades, and they discuss the difficulties of trying to maintain a romantic relationship with an artist.\n\nMeanwhile, Jules is puzzled by George's new technique and concerned that his obsession with his work is alienating him from his fellow artists and collectors alike. He refuses to support the work. Jules and Yvonne leave, and George, having forgotten Dot was there, goes back to work. Dot reveals the real reason for her visit: Despite the obvious fact that George fathered her unborn child, she and Louis are getting married and leaving for America. George angrily retreats behind his canvas, and she begs him to react in some way to her news. They argue bitterly about their failed relationship, and Dot concludes sadly that while George may be capable of self-fulfillment, she is not, and they must part (\"We Do Not Belong Together\").\n\nIn the park, the Old Lady finally agrees to sit for George, losing herself in fond memories of his childhood that George repeatedly disputes. She bemoans Paris's changing skyline, and he encourages her to see the beauty in the world as it is, rather than how it had been (\"Beautiful\"). The American Tourists arrive with Louis and Dot, who holds her newborn daughter, Marie. George refuses to acknowledge her as his child, and says that Louis will be able to care for her in a way that he cannot before offering a feeble apology as Dot sadly departs.\n\nThe park grows noisy: the Celestes and the Soldier argue over their respective breakups while Jules and Frieda sneak away to have a tryst. Louise informs Yvonne of her father's infidelity and a fight breaks out among Jules, Yvonne, Franz, and Frieda. The Celestes and the Soldier squabble noisily, and soon all the park-goers are fighting until the Old Lady shouts, \"Remember, George!\", and he stops them all with a gesture. George takes control of the subjects of his painting, who sing in harmony, transforming them into the final tableau of his finished painting (\"Sunday\").\n\n### Act II\n\nAs the curtain opens the characters, still in the tableau, complain about being stuck in the painting (\"It's Hot Up Here\"). The characters deliver short eulogies for George, who died suddenly at 31. The stage transforms back to a blank, white canvas.\n\nThe action fast-forwards a century to 1984. George and Dot's great-grandson, also an artist named George, is at a museum unveiling his latest work, a reflection on Seurat's painting in the form of a light machine called \"Chromolume #7.\" George presents the work, grounding its connection to the painting by inviting his 98-year-old grandmother, Marie, to help him present the work. Marie shares her family history, describing how her mother, Dot, informed her on her deathbed that she was Seurat's daughter. George is skeptical of that bit of family lore, but Marie insists that the notes in Dot's grammar book, which mention George, are proof. After a brief technical failure, the Chromolume is unveiled.\n\nAt the reception, various patrons and curators congratulate George on his work while George flits among them, commenting on the difficulties of producing modern art (\"Putting It Together\"). Like his great-grandfather, he conjures his surroundings, allowing himself to hold multiple conversations at once. The only voice he finds he cannot ignore is that of an art critic who advises him that he is repeating himself and wasting his gifts. After the museum's patrons have left for dinner, Marie speaks to her mother's image in the painting, worrying about George. When he arrives to take her home, she tells him about her mother, attempting to pass on a message about the legacy we leave behind (\"Children and Art\"). She dozes off and George, alone with the painting, realizes he is lacking connection.\n\nWeeks later, Marie has died and George has been invited by the French government to do a presentation of the Chromolume on the island the painting depicts. There George reveals to his friend Dennis that he has turned down his next commission. Feeling adrift and unsure, George reads from a book he inherited from his grandmother\u2014the same one Dot used to learn to read\u2014and ponders the similarities between himself and his great-grandfather (\"Lesson #8\").\n\nA vision of Dot appears and greets George, whom she addresses as if he were the George she knew. He confides his doubts to her and she tells him to stop worrying about whether his choices are right and simply make them (\"Move On\"). George finds some words written in the back of the book\u2014the words George often muttered while he worked. As George reads them aloud the characters from the painting fill the stage and recreate their tableau (\"Sunday\"). As they leave and the stage resembles a blank canvas, George reads: \"White: a blank page or canvas. His favorite\u2014so many possibilities.\"",

Jim's Uncle Bob calls the gas station to inquire about when his Winnebago will be fixed, and Jim stalls him by saying it takes time and extra care to do the job right (\"Takin' It Slow\"). Jim talks about the ladies that swing through the area, noting that his employee Jackson chases them, Eddie (a friend of the pump boys who hangs out at the station while his Edsel is being fixed) once lured a wealthy actress, but L.M., the station bookkeeper, draws the most attention, which L.M. doesn't even want (\"Serve Yourself\").\n\nAt the Double Cupp, Rhetta advertises the diner's menu (\"Menu Song\"). Prudie talks about how the male-to-female ratio in the area plays in her favor, and that although Eddie comes close to her ideal, his being from the nearby \"inbred\" town of Smyrna is a deal-breaker, and her real soulmate is in the audience (\"Best Man\"). Jim talks about how he forgot he had promised to take Rhetta to a minor league baseball game when he chose to go fishing instead (\"Fisherman's Prayer\"/\"Catfish\"). Jim recalls his late grandmother (\"Mamaw\"). Jim takes one of the catfish from his fishing trip to Rhetta to cook, but Rhetta is still jilted and tells him off (\"Be Good or Be Gone\"), to which Jim tries to make good by offering her a silk artificial rose and to clean up his truck if she accepts another date at a nearby bar (\"Drinkin' Shoes\").\n\n### Act Two\n\nAfter intermission, the Pump Boys advertise their gas station's services and goods (\"Pump Boys\"). Jackson talks about what he does on the weekends, when he goes into town, where he has a crush on a cashier at Woolworth's (\"Mona\"). Jim and Jackson recall an exceptionally dry and troublesome summer the previous year, when anything that could go wrong did , which segues into a story about how L.M. met Dolly Parton backstage after a concert and had a brief fling before he cut off the affair due to extenuating circumstances (\"The Night Dolly Parton Was Almost Mine\").\n\nAt the Double Cupp, Rhetta and Prudie sing about wanting tips from their customers (\"Tips\") before reflecting on their childhood under an absent single mother, lamenting the emotional distance between each other (\"Sisters\"), then decide to shut down the diner for a time and take a trip (\"I Need a Vacation\"). The pump boys and Cupp sisters all head on a road trip to Florida in Bob's miraculously fixed Winnebago (\"No Holds Barred\"), where L.M. now relishes in the attention of the ogling \" brown \" onlookers (\"Farmer Tan\"). Bob calls the group, and Jim assures him that they will be returning soon (\"Highway 57 (Reprise)\"). Upon returning, they close the diner and gas station (\"Closing Time\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn Salzburg , Federal State of Austria , just before World War II , nuns from Nonnberg Abbey sing the Dixit Dominus . One of the postulants , Maria Rainer, is on the nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the beautiful hills (\" The Sound of Music \"). She returns late to the abbey where the Mother Abbess and the other nuns have been considering what to do about the free-spirit (\" Maria \"). Maria explains her lateness, saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song (\" My Favorite Things \"). The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the abbey to decide whether she is suited for the monastic life. She will act as the governess to the seven children of a widower, Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine Captain Georg von Trapp .\n\nMaria arrives at the villa of Captain von Trapp. He explains her duties and summons the children with a boatswain's call . They march in, clad in uniforms. He teaches her their individual signals on the call, but she openly disapproves of this militaristic approach. Alone with them, she breaks through their wariness and teaches them the basics of music (\" Do-Re-Mi \").\n\nRolf, a young messenger, delivers a telegram and then meets with the eldest child, Liesl, outside the villa. He claims he knows what is right for her because he is a year older than she (\" Sixteen Going on Seventeen \"). They kiss, and he runs off, leaving her squealing with joy. Meanwhile, the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, gives Maria material to make new clothes, as Maria had given all her possessions to the poor. Maria sees Liesl slipping in through the window, wet from a sudden thunderstorm, but agrees to keep her secret. The other children are frightened by the storm. Maria sings \" The Lonely Goatherd \" to distract them.\n\nCaptain von Trapp arrives a month later from Vienna with Baroness Elsa Schraeder and Max Detweiler. Elsa tells Max that something is preventing the Captain from marrying her. He opines that only poor people have the time for great romances (\"How Can Love Survive\"). Rolf enters, looking for Liesl, and greets them with \" Heil \". The Captain orders him away, saying that he is Austrian, not German. Maria and the children leapfrog in, wearing play-clothes that she made from the old drapes in her room. Infuriated, the Captain sends them off to change. She tells him that the children need him to show his love for them, and he angrily orders her back to the abbey. As she apologizes, they hear the children singing \"The Sound of Music\", which she had taught them, to welcome Elsa Schraeder. He joins in and embraces them. Alone with Maria, he asks her to stay, thanking her for bringing music back into his house. Elsa is suspicious of her until she explains that she will be returning to the abbey in September.\n\nThe Captain gives a party to introduce Elsa, and guests argue over the Anschluss (the Nazi German annexation of Austria). Kurt asks Maria to teach him to dance the L\u00e4ndler . When he fails to negotiate a complicated figure, the Captain steps in to demonstrate. He and Maria dance until they come face-to-face; and she breaks away, embarrassed and confused. Discussing the expected marriage between Elsa and the Captain, Brigitta tells Maria that she thinks Maria and the Captain are really in love with each other. Elsa asks the Captain to allow the children to say goodnight to the guests with a song (\" So Long, Farewell \"). Max is amazed at their talent and wants them for the Kaltzburg Festival, which he is organizing. The guests leave for the dining room, and Maria slips out the front door with her luggage.\n\nAt the abbey, Maria says that she is ready to take her monastic vows ; but the Mother Abbess realizes that she is running away from her feelings. She tells her to face the Captain and discover if they love each other, and tells her to search for and find the life she was meant to live (\" Climb Ev'ry Mountain \").\n\n### Act II\n\nMax teaches the children how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain that he is not doing it as Maria did. He tells them that he has asked Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing \"My Favorite Things\" but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing on her way to rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with the Captain about the imminent Anschluss , trying to convince him that it is inevitable (\" No Way to Stop It \"). When he refuses to compromise on his opposition to it, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be \"An Ordinary Couple\". As they marry, the nuns reprise \"Maria\" against the wedding processional.\n\nWhile Maria and the Captain are on their honeymoon, Max prepares the children to perform at the Kaltzburg Festival. Herr Zeller, the Gauleiter of the region, demands to know why they are not flying the Flag of Nazi Germany now that the Anschluss has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of the Nazi German occupation, the Captain decides the children should not sing at the event. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts that in a few years Liesl will be married (\"Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)\"). Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the German Navy , and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed Nazi . The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to Bremerhaven to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.\n\nAt the concert, after the von Trapps sing an elaborate reprise of \"Do-Re-Mi\", Max brings out the Captain's guitar. Captain von Trapp sings \" Edelweiss \", as a goodbye to his homeland, while using Austria's national flower as a symbol to declare his loyalty to the country. Max asks for an encore and announces that this is the von Trapp family's last chance to sing together, as the honor guard waits to escort the Captain to his new command. While the judges decide on the prizes, the von Trapps sing \"So Long, Farewell\" (reprise), leaving the stage in small groups. Max then announces the runners-up, stalling as much as possible. When he announces that the first prize goes to the von Trapps and they do not appear, the Nazis start a search. The family hides at the Abbey, and Sister Margaretta tells them that the borders have been closed. Rolf comes upon them and calls his lieutenant, but after seeing Liesl he changes his mind and tells him they aren't there. The Nazis leave, and the von Trapps flee over the Alps as the nuns reprise \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\".",

        "description": "The Scarlet Pimpernel is a musical with music by Frank Wildhorn and lyrics & book by Nan Knighton , based on the 1905 novel of the same name by Baroness Orczy . The show is set in England and France during the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution . The story is a precursor to the spy fiction and the superhero genres, where a hero hides under a mild-mannered alias.\n\nThe musical ran on Broadway from October 1997 to May 1999 at the Minskoff Theatre , closed, toured, and reopened from September 1999 to January 2000 at the Neil Simon Theatre , in several versions. It also had a US National tour, and regional and international productions followed.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nThe play opens at La Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise, a theatre where Marguerite St. Just is performing in her final show (\"Storybook\"). As she announces to the crowd her marriage to wealthy English aristocrat Sir Percy Blakeney. Citizen Chauvelin, a fanatical agent of the French republican revolutionaries, closes the theatre before the performance is finished. Percy, Marguerite, and her brother, Armand, leave for England, and Chauvelin oversees the execution of the Marquis de St.-Cyr by guillotine in the miserable streets of Paris (\"Madame Guillotine\").\n\nPercy and Marguerite wed in England (\"Believe\"). However, on the night of their wedding, Percy learns that his wife betrayed the Marquis de St.-Cyr, his friend, to the revolutionary government (\"Wedding Dance\"). Heartbroken, Percy is torn between his love for Marguerite and the knowledge of what she has done (\"Prayer\"). The Blakeneys' marriage grows cold.\n\nPercy determines to make amends for his friend's death by saving other innocents from the guillotine. He takes on the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel and convinces some of his friends (subsequently called \"bounders\") to join him in his daring rescue attempts; Armand, Marguerite's brother, insists on being included (\"Into the Fire\"). The band pretend to be inane fops , effectively throwing off any suspicions about the identity of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Under Percy's strict orders, Marguerite is told nothing.\n\nOver the next five weeks, the League rescues many potential victims of the guillotine in Paris (\"The Rescue\"). The furious Robespierre orders Chauvelin to discover the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel with the help of a Belgian spy named Grappin (Percy in disguise). Frustrated, Chauvelin vows to succeed (\"Falcon in the Dive\").\n\nBack in England, Marie, Marguerite's old costume designer and best friend, has come to the Blakeney estate and is painting Percy's portrait. The Blakeneys' maids gossip about the Scarlet Pimpernel with Percy, who continues his foppish act (\"Scarlet Pimpernel Transition\"). Marguerite cannot understand how Percy is so drastically different from the man whom she married (\"When I Look At You\").\n\nInformed that she has a visitor in the garden, Marguerite goes outside. Percy looks out at her in awe, yet remains confused about how he should act around her (\"When I Look At You (Reprise)\"). Marguerite's visitor turns out to be Chauvelin, who attempts to convince her to join him in his mission to unmask the Pimpernel, as the French believe he is a member of the Blakeney's circle. Percy joins the conversation and perplexes Chauvelin with his ridiculous ways. When Percy leaves, Chauvelin tries to remind Marguerite of the fiery passion they once shared for the Revolution and each other (\"Where's the Girl?\"). Marguerite rejects Chauvelin's advances and sends him away.\n\nArmand, just returned from a trip for the League, tells Marguerite that he is going on another trip, this time to France. She becomes upset because she believes that Armand is putting himself in danger\u2014and because he is the only one whom Marguerite feels truly loves her. Marguerite begs Armand to stay, but after trying to comfort her, he leaves, taking Marie back to Paris with him to assist the League (\"You Are My Home\").\n\nPercy tells his remaining men that the Prince of Wales, suspicious of their trips to France, wants to meet with them. To allay the Prince's suspicions, Percy shows the League how it is a man's duty to dress elegantly and flamboyantly, and they all display the latest fashion (\"The Creation of Man\"). At the palace, the League convinces the Prince that they have nothing to do with the Pimpernel's activities.\n\nChauvelin arrives to meet with the Prince but is brushed aside so that the League can help the Prince select his attire for the royal ball that night. Having received a note from Chauvelin, Marguerite meets him at the palace, and Chauvelin once again enlists her aid. Armand has been captured in France, and Chauvelin threatens to have him guillotined if Marguerite refuses to help find the Pimpernel (\"Marguerite's Dilemma (Instrumental)\"). Both Marguerite and Chauvelin wonder if they can trust each other; Percy finds them talking and wonders if he, too, can trust his wife (\"The Riddle\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nAt the Prince's ball (\"Entr'acte (Instrumental)\"), Percy and the other guests discuss the Pimpernel, who they all know is there that evening (\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\"). Percy then recites a poem he has created in honor of the Pimpernel, and the guests join in (\"They Seek Him Here\").\n\nMarguerite, desperate, convinces one of Percy's men to ask the Pimpernel to meet her on the footbridge at one o'clock (\"The Gavotte\"). She informs Chauvelin of the plan and goes to the footbridge. Percy comes but remains hidden in the shadows, keeping his identity concealed. Marguerite tells him of Chauvelin's plans and explains that she betrayed the Marquis de St.-Cyr under coercion. Torn, Marguerite begs the Pimpernel to escape before Chauvelin arrives, but the Pimpernel promises to save Armand and sends Marguerite away. Overjoyed, Percy now understands why he has loved Marguerite all along\u2014and that she has always remained the same (\"She Was There\"). Chauvelin arrives, but Percy's antics fluster him into leaving without discovering the Pimpernel's identity. The League then sets out for France to save Armand.\n\nStill unaware of the Pimpernel's identity, Marguerite does the same. Disguised as a tart , Marguerite attempts to uncover information about her brother, but she is quickly recognized and apprehended by Chauvelin (\"Storybook (Reprise)\"). While Chauvelin admires Marguerite's courageous efforts, he is angry that she was defying his threats, and he sends her to prison with Armand.\n\nUnable to get access to Marguerite and Armand, Grappin poses a plot to Chauvelin to have Armand lead them to the secret harbor that the League uses, where they can capture the entire group. Grappin tries to convince Chauvelin to let him dispose of Marguerite, but Chauvelin orders him to stick to the plan. Alone, Chauvelin rages over his failure to win Marguerite back (\"Where's the Girl? (Reprise)\").\n\nThe League meets with Percy, Marie, and Tussaud (Marie's fianc\u00e9) in Paris to try to find a way to save Marguerite and Armand. Unable to get close to them, even disguised as Grappin, Percy starts to think the situation is almost hopeless. He vows to go it alone, not wanting the rest of the League to continue to risk themselves, but they reassuredly state they will stand by him (\"Into the Fire (Reprise)\").\n\nIn prison, Armand assures Marguerite that the Pimpernel will save them. Refusing to believe it, Marguerite mourns the loss of Percy and of her life (\"I'll Forget You\"). However, the two are \"rescued\" by \"League members\" and set off for the League's harbor at the coastal town of Michelon, having no idea that Chauvelin is on their trail. On the way, Marguerite learns her husband's secret identity.\n\nAt Michelon, Marguerite and Armand discover that a guillotine has been erected at the harbour. Chauvelin and his soldiers arrive, and when Marguerite desperately calls for Percy to run, Chauvelin finally begins to suspect who his adversary truly is.\n\nGrappin turns up and informs Chauvelin that the Pimpernel\u2014who Grappin confirms is Sir Percy Blakeney\u2014is heading for Calais. Chauvelin sends some of his men off to intercept the Pimpernel but still keeps soldiers to assist him. When Percy \"accidentally\" lets his identity slip, he and Chauvelin duel. Marguerite steps in several times to help Percy, but Chauvelin still wins (\"The Duel\"). Percy is then immediately guillotined.\n\nConfident in his triumph, Chauvelin sends most of his remaining soldiers away to carry the news to Robespierre, leaving only a small squad. However, to Chauvelin's utter bewilderment, Percy stands up from the guillotine unharmed. The head that fell is, in fact, a wax one that Marie (who, having married Tussaud, is revealed to be Marie Tussaud ) created to fool Chauvelin. The whole duel and execution was but a ruse to lull Chauvelin into a sense of overconfidence and send the majority of his forces away. The remaining soldiers turn out to be the League in disguise.\n\nPercy's men tie up Chauvelin and leave him with planted evidence incriminating him as the Scarlet Pimpernel. Percy, Marguerite, Armand, and the bounders then set off for England. Marguerite and Percy confide in each other the true love that they have always had for each other (\"Believe (Reprise)\").",

The film's structure is inspired by Tom Stoppard 's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , a tragicomedy that tells the story of Hamlet from the point of view of two minor characters . The Lion King 1\u00bd received generally positive reviews from critics.",
        "synopsis": "In a home theater Timon and Pumbaa watches the opening act of the first film until Timon fast forwards to the Hakuna Matata scene where they appear. However, Pumbaa rewinds the film to the beginning so as he want to not confuse the audience. Timon decides to tell the story about how he and Pumbaa met and learned Hakuna Matata, which Pumbaa agrees to. They rewind the film to back before the beginning as their own story begins.\n\nThe meerkat Timon lives in his colony on the outskirts of the Pride Lands with his Ma and Uncle Max but is an outcast to the meerkats. One day, while assigned as a lookout for hyenas , his daydreaming of a better life leads to a hyena attack, prompting Timon to leave the colony after deciding that he will never fit in. During his journey, he meets the mandrill Rafiki , who teaches him the philosophy of \" Hakuna Matata \" and advises him to \"look beyond what you see.\" Timon takes this advice literally, and, observes Pride Rock in the distance, sets out in that direction. Later, Timon encounters the warthog Pumbaa.\n\nThe pair arrive at Pride Rock during the presentation of Simba to the animals of the Pride Lands, and as they make their way through the crowd, Pumbaa passes gas from his agoraphobia , causing the nearby animals to faint and prompting animals further away to bow to Simba. Attempting to find their perfect home, the pair witness the dramatic ending of \" I Just Can't Wait to Be King \", the chase through the Elephant Graveyard, the hyena march scene of \" Be Prepared \", and the wildebeest stampede that kills Mufasa. Escaping the stampede, the pair are sent down a river and over a waterfall. Exhausted, Timon suggests giving up and going home. Pumbaa admits that he does not have a home, and the pair realize they are each other's only friends. They discover that the river has deposited them in a lush green jungle that Pumbaa was trying to tell Timon about. The pair settle there, embracing \"Hakuna Matata\" as their philosophy. Meanwhile, Timon's mother and Uncle Max leave the colony in search of Timon after Ma gets mad at Rafiki for apparently leading Timon on a wild goose chase.\n\nTimon and Pumbaa later rescue Simba and raise him under their philosophy such as eating grubs and relaxing in a hot tub. Years later, Simba's childhood friend Nala appears and reunites with him. Believing the trio's friendship to be in jeopardy, Timon and Pumbaa attempt to sabotage their burgeoning romance, and believe they have succeeded when they see the two get into an argument about why Simba refuses to return to Pride Rock much to Timon's excitement. The next day, Nala explains that Simba has returned home to challenge Scar and reclaim his rightful place as king. Pumbaa follows him, but Timon, angry that Simba has seemingly discarded their philosophy, refuses to help. Timon soon becomes lonely without his friends' company, and Rafiki indirectly helps him realize that his true Hakuna Matata is with the ones he loves. Timon catches up and reconciles with Pumbaa in the desert.\n\nAfter helping to distract the hyenas with a hula dance in the Pride Lands, Timon and Pumbaa run into Ma and Uncle Max. Seeing the hyenas advancing on Simba, Timon proposes that they all help Simba by getting rid of the hyenas for good. Ma and Uncle Max construct a series of tunnels beneath the hyenas while Timon and Pumbaa stall for time. Uncle Max collapses the tunnels, breaking the ground under the hyenas. Timon breaks the final support beam himself and the hyenas are ejected through the tunnels, which Scar then falls into. Simba accepts his place as the rightful king of the Pride Lands, thanking Timon and Pumbaa for their help. Timon invites Ma, Uncle Max, and the rest of the meerkat colony to live in the jungle with him and Pumbaa to complete his Hakuna Matata; the colony praise him as their hero.\n\nAs the film ends Pumbaa wants to watch it again, but Timon declines. Ma comes in wants to watch the film and rewinds the movie. They were soon joined by Uncle Max, Simba, Rafiki, and various Disney characters such as Mickey Mouse , Snow White , Stitch , and many more. Pumbaa gives Timon the remote and plays the movie.",

After a hard day at work, Mia's next audition goes awry because the casting director takes a phone call during an emotional scene. That night, her roommates take her to a lavish party in the Hollywood Hills , promising her that it could jump-start her career (\"Someone in the Crowd\"). After her car is towed, she walks home in disappointment.\n\nDuring a gig at a restaurant, Seb slips into jazz improvisation (\"Mia & Sebastian's Theme\") despite the owner's warning to only play traditional Christmas pieces. Mia hears him playing as she passes by. Moved, she enters the restaurant and observes Seb being fired for his disobedience. Mia attempts to compliment him as he storms out, but he brushes by her. Months later, she runs into Seb at a party where he plays in a 1980s pop cover band. Mia requests that Seb play \" I Ran \" for her. After the gig, they walk to their cars and\u00a0\u2013 despite an obvious chemistry\u00a0\u2013 lament wasting the night on each other (\"A Lovely Night\").\n\nSeb arrives at Mia's workplace, and she shows him around the Warner Bros. backlot , where she works as a barista , while expressing her passion for acting. He takes her to a jazz club , describing his passion for jazz and his desire to open his own club.

Two weeks later, Seb misses Mia's play because of a photoshoot he had forgotten about. The play fails, very few people attend, and Mia overhears dismissive comments about her performance. Unable to forgive him for missing her play and their previous argument, Mia returns to her hometown of Boulder City, Nevada .\n\nSeb receives a call from a prominent casting director who attended Mia's play, inviting her to audition for an upcoming film. Knowing that this could be her big break, he drives in a hurry to Boulder City and finds her house since he remembered that she lived across the street from the library, where she fell in love with acting. Seb persuades her to attend, and she reluctantly agrees to go.\n\nDuring the audition the next day, Mia is asked to tell a story. In response, she sings about how her aunt, a one-time stage actress who eventually died from alcoholism , inspired her to chase her dreams (\" Audition (The Fools Who Dream) \"). Confident the audition was a success, Seb encourages Mia to devote herself to acting. The two then recognize that they will always love each other despite what may come for their relationship.\n\nFive years later, Mia is living a happy life as a successful actress and married to a different man, with whom she has a daughter. That night, the couple stumble upon a jazz bar. Recognizing the logo she had once designed, Mia realizes that Seb has opened his own jazz club. Seb notices Mia in the crowd and begins to play their love theme on the piano. The two imagine what their happy life together would have been (\"Epilogue\") had their relationship thrived along with their careers, then acknowledge each other with a silent exchange of smiles and go their separate ways.",

The Islanders meet her and unload the boat ( The Boat's In ).\n\nGeraldine is welcomed as a possible solution to the coronation problem but her presence disturbs Molly, an island girl.\n\nMolly gazes past the horizon and yearns for a man as handsome as Geraldine is beautiful ( A Man From The Mainland ).\n\nAlbert, Lord Paul's nephew, shows Geraldine round the island.

It tells the story of a young disfigured woman who embarks on a journey by bus from her farm in Spruce Pine, North Carolina , all the way to Tulsa, Oklahoma in order to be healed.  The musical premiered Off-Broadway in 1997 and won the Drama Critics' Circle Award and Lucille Lortel Award as Best Musical.",
        "synopsis": "With a ticket, a suitcase, and a heart full of expectation, Violet Karl waits for a Greyhound bus in Spruce Pine, North Carolina. It is September 4, 1964. For\na moment she sees herself as a young girl (Young Vi), carefree and singing a folk song (\"Water in the Well\"), before her face was horribly disfigured in an accident. A local's nosy question breaks Violet's reverie, prompting her to look forward to the healing she expects to receive from a televangelist in Tulsa that will help her transcend her provincial little town (\"Surprised\"). As the bus departs the station, the passengers muse as to where this journey might lead them (\"On My Way\").\n\nThe passengers pile off the bus to get some food at a rest stop in Kingsport, Tennessee (\"M&M's\"). In the grill Violet meets two poker-playing soldiers, Flick and Monty. Flick is a black sergeant in his early thirties, Monty a younger white corporal, a paratrooper. Both are bound for Fort Smith, Arkansas. Violet asks to join their game, and as they deal her in, she privately recalls how her father taught her to play (\"Luck of the Draw\").\n\nBack on the bus, Monty teases Violet about a preacher he obviously has no faith in (\"Question 'n' Answer\"). He takes a book she carries and plays keep-away with it, which triggers Violet's memory of the day she found the catechism in her father's bedside table. Later, in the Nashville station, Flick wants to know exactly what it is that Violet wants to change. With the help of movie magazines she shows the soldiers the physical features she'd like best (\"All to Pieces\"), but they offend her when their attention wanders. She sits apart from them as the journey continues, recalling once again her younger self singing the folk song, which turns out to have been the moment just before the accident (\"Water in the Well [Reprise]\"). Violet daydreams an encounter between herself as Young Vi and the Preacher (\"A Healing Touch\").\nAs they are approaching Memphis, Flick seeks Violet out to apologize for offending her earlier. He suggests she can take care of herself without the help of the Preacher (\"Let It Sing\"). Stopping in Memphis overnight, the trio pass a hooker on the way to a boarding house, where Almeta the landlady resists housing a white woman until Flick slips her some money (\"Anyone Would Do\"). While a song plays on the radio (\"Who'll Be the One [If Not Me]\"), Violet dozes, seeing herself as Young Vi trying to dance with her father, then practicing dancing with the old lady from the bus. Monty appears and dances with both women in turn. In reality, Monty has entered Violet's room. He finds her book and starts to read things Violet has written in it. She awakes and confronts him, prompting Monty to explain himself (\"You're Different\" or \"Last Time I Came to Memphis\" in the 2014 revival).\n\nFlick enters the room with some drinks to start the night off (\"Go to It\"). The threesome venture out to a Beale Street music hall, where the sight of Flick dancing with Violet attracts some unfriendly attention (\"Lonely Stranger\"). When Monty moves in and makes a pass at Violet, Flick leaves the hall. Violet follows him back to the boarding house; the landlady interrupts a tender moment between them.\nIn the middle of the night, Monty stumbles in through Violet's unlocked door. He wakes her, makes love to her, then falls asleep in her lap (\"Lay Down Your Head\").\n\nThe music hall singer, the landlady and the hooker cap the evening with a trio about unfulfilled desire (\"Anyone Would Do [Reprise]\"). Violet travels with the men to Fort Smith the next morning, on her way to Tulsa. Flick and Violet pledge to write each other, but Flick gets upset about the events of the night before (\"Hard to Say Goodbye\"). Violet escapes to the bus bathroom, where she rehearses what she will say to spurn Monty, afraid he'll otherwise reject her first. In the front of the bus Monty rehearses his own spiel, at Flick's direction. But when it comes time to part, Monty instead asks Violet to meet him on her return stop at Fort Smith (\"Promise Me, Violet\"). She promises nothing, cleaving to her plan, and the bus pulls away.\n\nIn Tulsa, Violet surprises the Preacher in rehearsal with his choir (\"Raise Me Up\"). He pawns her off on Virgil, a young assistant, and in her frustration she recovers the memory of being carried in her father's arms after the accident (\"Down the Mountain\"). Soon she slips away from Virgil and returns to the televangelist's empty chapel. Violet takes out her catechism and empties slips of paper she has covered with Bible quotes onto the altar. When the Preacher discovers her, she pleads with him to help invoke her miracle (\"Raise Me Up [Reprise]\"). When nothing comes of this desperate attempt, she demands he see her for what she is: scarred and hideous, a prodigy of pain (\"Look at Me\"). She looks to the heavens for a moment; the Preacher is replaced by her father. They fight, until he apologizes for what he has done (\"That's What I Could Do\"). Aware that something about herself has changed, Violet assumes it is her scar; she reboards the bus, convinced she has had a miracle (\"Surprised [Reprise]\").\n\nWhen she gets out at the Fort Smith station, Monty is there waiting. His efforts at sympathy make plain to her that her face has not changed at all. Crushed, she rejects Monty's invitation to marry him before he ships out to Vietnam. Flick is also at the station and recognizes that Violet has changed, though her scar has not. He entreats her to stay with him (\"Promise Me, Violet [Reprise]\"). Violet's healing is complete when she takes Flick's hand and commits to a new life with him (\"Bring Me to Light\").",

The musical's cast recording debuted at No. 63 on the American iTunes Top 100 albums chart.",
        "synopsis": "### Prologue\n\nSherrezade introduces the audience to a Magic Kingdom (an analogue of The Walt Disney Company ) that prospered for many years thanks to its commitment to \" the two Ds : duty and devotion\". Following a period of prosperity , the Kingdom fell into the hands of a corrupt sultan and entered a dark age . The only man who can rescue the Kingdom is the misunderstood royal vizier Ja'far .\n\n### Act I\n\nJa'far walks the streets of the Kingdom while the citizens jeer him. While Ja'far does his best to be a sensible and scientific planner, the citizens prefer to wish for their unrealistic dreams to come true and blame Ja'far for all their problems (\"Dream a Little Harder\"). Ja'far is informed by the captain of the guards that while attempting to pursue a thief who stole a loaf of bread, several men were injured or killed, and furthermore that the thief insulted visiting dignitary Prince Achmed . The selfish, shiftless and callous thief, Aladdin , explains his philosophy that everything in the world is his to steal (\"I Steal Everything\").\n\nJa'far returns to the palace but is greeted by Achmed; the ruler of the Kingdom of Pik-Zahr , angered by the Princess setting her pet tiger upon him. Insulted, Prince Achmed declares war on the Magic Kingdom. Ja'far berates the Princess for her carelessness while she na\u00efvely longs for a life of freedom (\"Everything and More\").\n\nDistraught to learn of his 2Ds department's sacking, Ja'far wrecks his room. He finds a scarab necklace that reminds him of the past when he was beloved by the citizens (\"Sands of Time\"). In an extended flashback, Ja'far teaches them about \" The Golden Rule \" of always treating others the way one wishes to be treated (\"The Golden Rule\"). On arriving at the vizier's palace for his first day as an assistant, Ja'far discovers that the vizier and his court are corrupt and only care about money (\"The Golden Rule (Evil Reprise)\"). Ja'far wonders if he will ever effect real change without the Sultan's audience. His mood is lifted when he meets the palace storyteller Sherrezade, who tells him stories including the Tiger Head Cave, which among other riches contains an oil lamp housing a wish-granting Djinn . Despite his skepticism of the stories, they fall in love and marry (\"A Thousand and One Nights\"). Months pass, and the Sultan finally gives Ja'far an audience; Sherrezade accompanies him. The Sultan , a babbling fool who tells the court he inverted his penis , is immediately taken with Sherrezade and claims her as his concubine. Sherrezade gives Ja'far the scarab necklace and vows that they will be reunited one day. In the present, Ja'far sadly notes that she died in childbirth before they could reunite. Though not fully convinced of the power of magic, Ja'far decides to seek out the Tiger Head Cave and the wish-granting Djinn (\"If I Believed\").\n\nMeanwhile, the Princess meets Aladdin and is entranced by his free lifestyle and lack of respect for royalty, oblivious to his sexual advances. Aladdin explains how he never had a chance to become a valuable member of society since his parents died earlier in the year (\"Orphaned at Thirty-Three\"). Before they can kiss, they are caught by the royal guards, who throw Aladdin in prison and take the Princess home. Ja'far releases Aladdin on the condition he retrieves the Djinn's lamp from the Tiger Head Cave, claiming it to be an ordinary lamp. He also promises that Aladdin can keep all the other treasures he finds. The Princess, Aladdin, and Ja'far reflect on what they want most (\"Happy Ending\") before Aladdin exits the Tiger Head Cave and flees with the lamp, having discovered the Djinn and wanting it for himself, leaving Ja'far distraught.\n\n### Act II\n\nPrince Achmed returns to the kingdom of Pik-Zahr and informs his soldiers of his meeting with the Princess (however, his soldiers misconstrue his story, believing that he had sexual intercourse with the Princess' tiger). Achmed despairs that he will only be remembered as a throwaway joke . Believing that destroying the Princess' kingdom will win her affection, he and his soldiers march to war (\"No One Remembers Achmed\").\n\nJa'far has a heart-to-heart with the Princess about her future as a leader. Ja'far tries to warn her about Aladdin's true intentions but is called away when The Captain tells them that an unknown wealthy prince is leading a parade through the market, causing untold mayhem and injury. The prince visits the Princess, who immediately recognizes him as Aladdin. He nevertheless manages to convince her that the prince is his true persona. He takes the Princess on a magic carpet ride and unsuccessfully tries to convince her to have sex (\"Take Off Your Clothes\"). The Princess realizes that Aladdin's claimed great armies could help against Achmed's invasion. She proposes marriage, which Aladdin lustfully accepts.\n\nThe Sultan introduces his future son-in-law, Aladdin, to Ja'far, who impatiently explains that Aladdin is not an actual prince. Aladdin manages to convince the Sultan that Ja'far is a sorcerer who is using hypnosis, prompting the Sultan to sentence Ja'far to death. Ja'far grabs the lamp and escapes. Alone with the lamp, Ja'far is visited by various Disney villains from Sherrezade's tales. They claim they are not evil and that their stories have become \"twisted\" throughout the years (save for Cruella De Vil who everyone hates). Ja'far accepts that he has to take the \"twisted\" path himself, or his sacrifices will have been for nothing, and uses the lamp (\"Twisted\").\n\nPrince Achmed invades, and Aladdin and his army are nowhere to be found. Achmed calls for the head of the Sultan, and Ja'far, having used his first wish to become the Sultan, enters. He releases the Djinn, who speaks entirely in movie quotes incomprehensible to Ja'far, and uses his second wish to make himself a powerful sorcerer. The Princess finally realizes that Aladdin is a fraud, and rejects him. Aladdin takes the Princess hostage, and as Ja'far pleads with him to release her, he realizes that the Princess is his own daughter, as the Sultan's inverted penis would not allow him to have a child. Aladdin reveals a darker, more sinister split-personality who murdered his parents when they attempted to force him out of their house to find a job. Ja'far agrees to hand over the lamp in exchange for the Princess, but before Ja'far hands it over, he uses his final wish to free the Djinn and take its place in the lamp.\n\nNow a Djinn himself, Ja'far gives the lamp to the Princess, believing her youth and passion make her the only one who can use the lamp's power to its fullest potential. The Princess wishes to bring a peaceful end to the war with Pik-Zahr, and for the Kingdom to have a Sultan that will make it prosper again. Finally, she tries to wish that Ja'far did not have to return to the lamp, but he cannot grant that wish, so she instead wishes Ja'far happiness, and they part ways (\"The Power In Me\"). News arrives that the Sultan has died, naming the Princess the majority stockholder and sole ruler of the Kingdom. Achmed's troops arrive in the throne room, and the Princess buys the entirety of Pik-Zahr with Ali Baba's treasure , discovered during the battle.\n\nIn the lamp, Ja'far has resigned himself to his fate before suddenly being greeted by Sherrezade, brought back to life by the Princess's last wish. She explains that the lamp exists outside of time and space, which is how the Djinn had knowledge of movies from the future. Ja'far sees that Aladdin will become a Peddler who spends his days telling a warped version of the story , until his ironic death at the hands of a thief over a loaf of bread at the age of 55. The couple then decide to live happily ever after (\"Finale / A Thousand And One Nights Reprise\").",

The Interlocutor, the host of the Minstrel Show , introduces the players in the troupe, including Mr. Bones and Mr. Tambo, then begins the story of the Scottsboro Boys (\"Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey!\").\n\nIn 1931, Haywood Patterson , one of the nine boys riding in a boxcar on a train to Memphis, is ready to see the world (\"Commencing in Chattanooga\"). As the train is stopped, two white girls jump out, and two policemen recognize them as prostitutes. To get away, they accuse the nearby boys of rape (\"Alabama Ladies\"), and the boys are sent to jail.

Awaiting execution, the boys long to return home (\"Go Back Home\").  Just as the executions are about to begin, the verdict is overturned. In  the North, the case has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre , and the Supreme Court has ruled the boys didn't have effective counsel.

The next trial gets under way in the spring of 1933. Public outrage over the trial has grown, especially in the North. They are given a New York lawyer, Samuel Leibowitz , to represent them to court (\"That's Not The Way We Do Things\").  During the trial, Ruby Bates, one of the girls, surprises the court and admits that the boys are innocent (\"Never Too Late\"). But, upon cross-examination, the Southern District Attorney makes antisemitic claims that Ruby Bates' change of heart was purchased by Leibowitz (\"Financial Advice\").\n\nWhile the boys sit in a holding cell, waiting for the verdict, they talk about what they will do when the trial is over, believing that they can't be found guilty of crime that never happened. They talk about heading North, but the Interlocutor reminds them that they belong in the South (\"Southern Days\").  The boys are found guilty again and are sent back to prison. Haywood tries to escape in order to see his mother before she dies (\"Commencing in Chattanooga (Reprise)\"), but he's quickly caught.\n\nAs time passes, Leibowitz continues to appeal the verdict. In every trial, the boys are found guilty. Even the other girl, Victoria Price, begins to buckle (\"Alabama Ladies (Reprise)\"), tired of being dragged to repeated trials, but she never recants her testimony. One of the boys, Ozie Powell, is shot in the head after assaulting a guard and is left brain-damaged. By 1937, four of the youngest boys are released, but the other five remain in prison. Haywood wonders if he will ever get justice, and the Interlocutor advises him to be patient (\"It's gonna take time\"). Finally, Haywood is brought up for parole in front of the governor of Alabama , but will not be given parole unless he pleads guilty (\"Zat So?\") He defiantly refuses (\"You Can't Do Me\").  Haywood dies twenty-two years later in prison. As the show ends, the Interlocutor calls for the finale. The boys appear dressed in full-blown Minstrel attire and blackface, alternating between a high-energy closing number and solemnly relating how their experiences in prison left them unable to leave normal lives, leading to careers of unemployment, addiction, suicide and tragedy. The Interlocutor calls for the cakewalk, but the boys refuse, wiping off their make-up in defiance, and disappear. (\" The Scottsboro Boys \").\n\nThe scene fades back to the bus stop, just as the bus arrives. The lady, who is, in fact, Rosa Parks , boards the bus. The driver, who is revealed to be the Interlocutor, tells her to move to the back of the bus, but she refuses to comply.",

        "synopsis": "Act I\n\n\"The citizens of Brachen are awaiting the visit of their very own Claire Wascher, now Claire Zachanassian, the oft-widowed, richest woman in the world. It's been a lifetime's absence during which they have fallen into utter bankruptcy. In anticipation of this visit, Anton Shell, a once prosperous shop keeper, remembers himself and Claire as young lovers (\"Prelude\"). The Mayor and the School Master have prepared a special welcome for their distinguished visitor (\"Out of the Darkness\"). All Brachen marvels at their visitor's glamorous, bejeweled presence (\"At Last\"). Claire explains the reason for it (\"I Walk Away\"). Her warm greeting to Anton makes the Mayor realize that Anton is the key to asking Claire to relieve them from their misery. Anton is confident he can (\"I Know Claire\"). He leaves to rendezvous with Claire and their old trysting place, Konrad's Village Wood, while the others exult in their good fortune. Only the School Master has forebodings about her visit (\"A Happy Ending\"). Alone in the woods, the two old lovers and their younger selves reminisce (\"You, You, You\"). Anton is convinced that she will be their salvation (\"I Must Have Been Something\"). Everyone prepares for the gala banquet that evening at the Golden Apostle Hotel in Claire's honor (\"Look at Me\"). The Mayor and the citizens tell Claire of their inexplicable decline from prosperity to utter bankruptcy (\"A Masque\"). Claire then recounts her version of events, which differs considerably from theirs (\"Eunuch's Testimony\"). In exchange for rescuing them from financial calamity, she asks for the life of Anton Shell (\"Winter\"). The Mayor expresses outrage but the seeds have been planted (\"Yellow Shoes\").\n\nAct II\n\nClaire reveals that it is she herself who destroyed Brachen's once booming economy (\"A Confession\"). She is resolute in her terms: Anton's death. Claire's entourage, her Butler and two Eunuchs, swear eternal fealty to her (\"I Would Never Leave You\"). Alone in the attic above his shop, Anton wrestles with his fears (\"Back and Forth\"). The School Master visits Anton and tells him how the village is turning against him (\"The Only One\"). Anton struggles with his conscience (\"Fear\"). Embracing his fate and at peace with himself, he invites family for a drive in his son's new automobile, bought, like everything else in Brachen now, on credit (\"A Car Ride\"). Knowing Anton will join her in their old trysting place, Claire reflects on the incidents that have brought her to this moment in her life (\"Love and Love Alone\"). The lovers meet for a last time to discuss their whole past, including a child who died, before the town meeting that will decide Anton's fate (\"In the Forest Again\"). Agreeing to the terms, the townspeople murder Anton, with the town doctor recording that he \"died of joy.\" The visit over, Claire tells her butler, \"Rudi, get the bags packed. We are going to Capri\" (\"Finale\").",

Its songs include the well-known \" Tea for Two \" and \" I Want to Be Happy \".\n\nAfter a pre- Broadway tour in 1924, the musical was revised for a production later 1924 in Chicago, where it became a hit and ran for more than a year.

Jimmy thus has plenty of disposable income, and, because he likes to use his money to make people happy, he has secretly become the ( platonic ) benefactor of three beautiful women: Betty from Boston, Winnie from Washington, D.C., and Flora from San Francisco. Sue's best friend, Lucille, is married to Jimmy's lawyer and friend, Billy Early. Lucille is a spendthrift and delights in spending all the money Billy makes. Jimmy and Sue have a young ward , Nanette, who they hope will become a respectable young lady. At Jimmy and Sue's home in New York, many young men come to call on Nanette. Lucille advises the young people that having one steady boyfriend is better than many flirtations (\"Too Many Rings Around Rosie\"). Tom Trainor, Billy's nephew and assistant, works up the courage to tell Nanette that he loves her, and she returns his sentiments (\"I've Confessed to the Breeze\"). Tom wants to settle down and get married as soon as possible, but Nanette has an untapped wild side and wants to have some fun first.\n\nJimmy's lady friends are attempting to blackmail him, and he, afraid that Sue will find out about them, enlists Billy's legal help to discreetly ease the girls out of his life. Billy suggests that Jimmy take refuge in Philadelphia. Unknown to Jimmy, Billy decides to take Tom and meet the three ladies at the Smiths' seaside home, Chickadee Cottage, in Atlantic City , New Jersey (\"Call of the Sea\"). Sue and Lucille, hearing that both their husbands will be away on business, also decide to take a vacation to the cottage.\n\nNanette wants to go to Atlantic City with her friends, but Sue forbids her to go. Jimmy, wanting to make Nanette happy, gives her $200 and agrees to secretly take her to Chickadee Cottage, with the grumpy cook, Pauline, acting as Nanette's chaperone (\"I Want to Be Happy\"). Nanette is tired of everyone (especially Tom) trying to control her behavior and dreams of the extravagant fun she will have (\"No No Nanette\"). To tease Tom, she shows him the $200 and refuses to tell him how she got it. Tom angrily breaks off his relationship with Nanette, and, under the pretense that she is going to visit her grandmother in Trenton, New Jersey, Nanette leaves for Atlantic City (Finaletto Act I).\n\nNanette arrives in Atlantic City and quickly becomes the most popular girl on the beach (\"Peach on the Beach\"). Meanwhile, Jimmy crosses paths with his three girlfriends, who confront him with the promises he made to them (\"The Three Happies\"). Tom meets up with Nanette, and they resolve their quarrel, fantasizing about being happily married one day (\"Tea for Two\"). Lucille runs into Billy, and though she is surprised to meet him in Atlantic City, she assures him that she does not mind whether he spends time with other women as long as she's there to watch \u2013 and he comes home with her at the end of the evening (\"You Can Dance with Any Girl At All\").\n\nSue is shocked to find Nanette in Atlantic City. Nanette at first lies and said she was only visiting her grandmother in Trenton, but Sue knows that cannot be true: Nanette's only living grandmother lives in Omaha, Nebraska. Nanette admits that she actually spent the night in Atlantic City. Against her protests, Sue arranges for her to go back to New York with Pauline. Sue overhears Billy speaking to the women and, assuming that he is having an affair with them, tells Lucille. Billy, to keep Jimmy's secret, does not deny it, and Lucille says she is leaving him. Meanwhile, Tom, shocked by Nanette's behavior, breaks off their relationship. Jimmy is oblivious to the confusion he's created (Finaletto Act II).\n\nBilly tries to call Lucille on the telephone, but she refuses to answer. Flora, Winnie, and Betty tempt him to spend time with them instead (\"Telephone Girlie\"). Lucille, finding herself alone, realizes that she misses Billy, and nothing else can make her feel better (\"Where-Has-My-Hubby-Gone Blues\"). The truth begins to emerge as Lucille realizes that Billy cannot be the benefactor of the three girls; he never has any money to spend because Lucille spends it all! Jimmy finally pays off the ladies, and finally the truth comes out: Billy has not been cheating on Lucille, and though Jimmy has been spending his money on the three girls, it is strictly platonic.\n\nNanette and Pauline, unable to catch a train to New York, return to the cottage, where Tom and Nanette make up; however, it appears that once more, Tom wants to settle down while Nanette wants to enjoy being single. Tom produces a magnificent engagement ring, and Nanette has a change of heart, now insisting that they should get married today (\"Waiting for You\"). Sue and Lucille decide that in order to ensure Jimmy never again has philandering opportunities, Sue must spend all of Jimmy's money herself. The show ends with a tea dance , where Sue wows Jimmy with a fancy dress and a final dance number (\"Take a Little One-Step\"; \"Finale\").",

The production ran for 35 previews and 486 performances. Subsequently, the show has been staged in several other countries and by regional theatres.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nOff the West African coast, a young English couple and their newborn son barely survive a shipwreck and land in Africa . They construct a tree house for their son before being killed by a leopard named Sabor. In the African Jungle, Kerchak , the leader of a tribe of gorillas admires his new infant son with his mate, Kala (\" Two Worlds \"). Sabor suddenly appears and kidnaps the newborn baby gorilla. Kala goes off to find her son but finds the human boy instead and names him Tarzan . She mothers him and raises him despite Kerchak's refusal to treat Tarzan as his son (\" You'll Be In My Heart \").\n\nAs a young child, Tarzan finds that he cannot keep up with the tribe, while Kerchak views him as a threat. Despite this, Tarzan is befriended by the lighthearted Terk, a young gorilla who teaches him the ways of the gorillas (\"Who Better Than Me\"). However, Kerchak finds Tarzan constructing a spear, and assuming he intends to hurt the gorillas, he holds Kala accountable (\"No Other Way\"). Kala worries for him and goes off to find him. She discovers him despairing by the water's edge (\"I Need To Know\"). Kala tells him that even though they look different, underneath the skin, they are just the same, reigniting Tarzan's desire to become the best ape ever.\n\nYears pass, and Tarzan grows into a young man, athletic and resourceful (\" Son of Man \"), accepted by many of the gorillas as one of their own, except for Kerchak. Kala tries to convince Kerchak to accept Tarzan (\"Sure As Sun Turns To Moon\"). Kerchak won't change his mind until Tarzan kills Sabor to avenge his parents and prevent him from terrorizing the tribe any longer. Suddenly, gunshots are heard throughout the jungle, causing the tribe to scatter while Tarzan investigates what scared them away. Deep in the jungle, Jane Porter , a young English naturalist, is overwhelmed by the thrillingly diverse jungle life (\"Waiting For This Moment\"). While exploring, she is attacked by a giant spider but is rescued by Tarzan. Tarzan and Jane carefully assess each other as they realize their similar qualities (\"Different\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nAt the Porter expedition site, Terk and the other gorillas discover the site and all of its unique features, and do some redecorating (\"Trashin' The Camp\"). Jane returns to the site with Tarzan, and she is thrilled by the tribe of gorillas. Kerchak arrives and scares the gorillas off. Jane tries to convince her father, Professor Porter, and their guide, Clayton , that she discovered a wild man and a tribe of apes. Kerchak forbids contact with the humans, but Tarzan and Jane grow to love each other and Jane tells her father more about the wild ape man (\"Like No Man I've Ever Seen\"). Tarzan soon visits the humans and becomes properly acquainted with them, especially Jane, though Clayton becomes jealous of their love.\n\nJane tries to teach Tarzan more about humans and human life, while Tarzan shows her his jungle world, too (\" Strangers Like Me \"); all the while, Jane tries to cope with her emotions (\"For The First Time\"). She tries to tell her father to stop Clayton's plans of killing the gorillas, but Clayton, wanting to achieve his goal, tricks Tarzan into taking the humans to the gorilla nesting grounds. Tarzan asks Terk to help him by keeping Kerchak away, and Terk agrees (\"Who Better Than Me (Reprise)\"). As Tarzan shows the humans his gorilla family, Kerchak arrives anyway, scattering the humans and demanding that Tarzan choose who he is. Realizing her son is torn between his loyalty to his gorilla family and his need to be with humans, Kala shows Tarzan the treehouse his parents built and he discovers all of their belongings (\"Everything That I Am\"). He decides to go to England with Jane and live as a human and he tells Kala his decision (\"You'll Be In My Heart (Reprise)\").\n\nTarzan approaches Jane and Porter, announcing his intention to leave the jungle and be with Jane. At the same time, however, Clayton seizes the opportunity to capture the gorillas once and for all, and manages to shoot Kerchak, fatally wounding the gorilla leader. Tarzan rushes back at the sound of the gunshot and fights Clayton, nearly killing him until Porter convinces him to spare his life so they can handle Clayton in a less violent way; Clayton is soon arrested and sent back to the ship to await punishment back in England for his actions. Tarzan rushes to Kerchak, but he has already died from his wounds, and Kala and Tarzan mourn for Kerchak's demise (\"Sure As Sun Turns To Moon (Reprise)\").\n\nAt the beach, Jane and Porter are about to leave on their ship to return to England, until Jane realizes that she loves Tarzan and, with Porter's blessing, decides to stay with him in the jungle. Tarzan, having become the new leader of the gorillas, arrives to say goodbye to them, until Jane returns, and they share a kiss. Tarzan and Jane swing off towards their new home, planning to spend the rest of their lives together (\"Two Worlds (Reprise)\").",

This version starred Jean Arthur as Peter Pan , Boris Karloff in the dual roles of George Darling and Captain Hook , and Marcia Henderson as Wendy . The show was orchestrated by Trude Rittmann and Hershy Kay and conducted by Benjamin Steinberg . The show ran for 321 performances, closing on January 27, 1951.\n\nThe production was initially intended as a full-blown musical, with Bernstein composing a complete score for it, but was staged with only five songs \u2013 \"Who Am I?\", \"Pirate's Song\", \"Plank Round\", \"Build My House\", and \"Peter Peter\" \u2013 to accommodate the limited vocal ranges of the principals.\n\nIn 1998, conductor Alexander Frey began research into whether there may have existed more material that Bernstein had composed for Peter Pan. Over the next seven years, as his schedule allowed, he discovered and restored almost an hour of previously unheard music, much of the material found (and not yet orchestrated) in the archives of the composer's manuscripts. The restored songs included \"Captain Hook Soliloquy\" and \"Dream With Me\", as well as other sung material, dance music and orchestral interludes. The world premiere recording of Bernstein's complete score was released on CD in 2005, conducted by Alexander Frey, featuring Broadway star Linda Eder in the role of Wendy Darling and acclaimed baritone Daniel Narducci as Captain Hook , on the Koch International Classics label.\n\nIn December 2006, it was produced for the stage by The King's Head Theatre in Islington, London, with Katherine Kastin as Peter Pan, Peter Land as Captain Hook, and Rafaella Hutchinson as Tinker Bell, directed by Stephanie Sinclaire and featuring new musical arrangements by Mike Dixon. This production used only parts of the Bernstein score and none of the original orchestrations. The music was performed by an instrumental trio.\n\nIn September 2008 the world premiere performance of the full Bernstein score was performed in concert with Alexander Frey conducting the Gulbenkian Orchestra , with dialogue adapted from the original J. M. Barrie play by Nina Bernstein Simmons. Three performances were given in Cascais , Portugal, for a combined audience of over 10,000 people; they featured Geraldine James (narrator), John Sackville-West (Peter Pan), Charlotte Ellett and Rachel Nicholls (Wendy) and Nicholas Lester (Captain Hook).\n\nThe first stage production of the full Bernstein score was given by Santa Barbara Theater (California) in December 2008, directed by Albert Ihde with a full orchestra again conducted by Alexander Frey.\n\nAnother production was held at the Richard B.

        "synopsis": "Setting : Connecticut\n\n### Act I\n\nThis musical tells the story of how the Healys, a seemingly perfect white Connecticut family with an adopted Black daughter, begins to unravel when faced with issues of repressed gender identity, sexual assault, and substance abuse.\n\nMary Jane (MJ) Healy is a mother writing the yearly family Christmas letter . She writes about her husband Steve's job promotion, her daughter Frankie's art, and her son Nick's early admission to Harvard University . MJ writes that she got into a car crash, but is healing with the help of natural remedies . What she doesn't write is that Steve is addicted to pornography , Frankie is making out with her best friend, Jo, as the letter is being written, and MJ is addicted to the painkillers from the car accident (\"Right Through You\"). MJ pressures Nick and Frankie to be perfect to keep up the family's image (\"All I Really Want\"). At school, Frankie and Jo discuss how their mothers don't understand or accept them: Frankie's mom because of her disapproval of her self-expression, and Jo's mom not accepting them being gay or their gender expression . Jo is thankful for how Frankie understands them, and is sure that everything will turn out alright in the end (\" Hand in My Pocket \").\n\nMJ tries to get drugs from the pharmacy, but she is out of refills. Desperate, she meets with a familiar dealer, who provides her with opioids. She moves through her day backward, starting with unpacking groceries at home, getting her painkillers in the alley, keeping up appearances with other school moms, and ending with her running out of pills at the beginning of the day (\"Smiling\"). On the last day of Frankie's English class before winter break, she reads a short story she wrote aloud. The students in the class criticize her since things she claims to be ironic in her piece are not technically ironic, just bad things that happened to someone. A new student, Phoenix, defends Frankie and encourages her to finish (\" Ironic \"). A romantic attraction begins between the two. After class, Phoenix and Frankie decide to go to a party that night. At home, MJ and Steve get into an argument. Steve says he wants to see a marriage counselor , but MJ refuses (\"So Unsexy\"). Nick comforts MJ after the fight, to which she responds that he is the only thing she has ever done right. Nick reflects on the pressures on him from his mother to be perfect (\"Perfect\").\n\nFrankie and Nick go to the party (\"Lancer's Party (So Pure)\"). Frankie and Phoenix find each other and leave the crowded party to talk alone, and they discuss their imperfect family lives. Meanwhile, Jo doesn't attend the party because their mom forced them to go to a church function. Jo's mom scolds them for not dressing femininely enough (\"That I Would Be Good\"). The following day, Jo shows Frankie pictures that are circulating throughout the school of Bella, Nick's friend, who was drunk, passed out, and had her shirt pulled up at the party. Other students quickly mock Bella, calling her a slut . Despite barely knowing her, Frankie and Jo go to Bella's house to check on her. Bella reveals that Andrew, Nick's best friend, was the one who took the pictures and raped her. Frankie goes home and wakes Nick up to reprimand him about not going to the police, since he was the only one who saw how drunk Bella was. Nick brushes off Bella's claim, accusing her of being dramatic. MJ overhears the conversation and insists that Nick not come forward as it might ruin his reputation. MJ blames Bella for what happened since she chose to drink, but she is visibly upset by the story (\"Wake Up\"). MJ walks to the church for the first time in a while to pray about her failing marriage, struggling relationship with Frankie, and for help with her addiction. She then reflects on her memory of being raped in college, but blames herself and feels it was God's plan for her (\"Forgiven\").\n\n### Act II\n\nSteve and MJ go to their first marriage counseling session, despite MJ's reluctance (\"Not the Doctor\"). Meanwhile, Frankie and Phoenix hang out at a playground and end up sleeping together (\" Head over Feet \"). Jo enters the Healys' house uninvited (\"Your House\") and walks in on Frankie and Phoenix. Jo gets mad and storms out of Frankie's room. MJ and Steve come home early, and Jo tells them that Frankie and Phoenix had sex. Phoenix flees quickly, leaving Frankie alone with her parents. MJ and Steve reprimand her for having sex so young. Frankie comes out to her parents as bisexual , and she gets mad at her parents for disapproving of her consensual sex but not caring about Bella's rape. She subsequently runs away from the house. Steve and MJ fight about the former not being present during Frankie's childhood, while Frankie takes a train alone to New York (\"Unprodigal Daughter\"). When she gets lost in the city, Frankie calls Phoenix. She tells him that she loves him and that he should come pick her up. However, when Phoenix doesn't say \"I love you\" back and says he needs to stay at home to help his sister with a medical condition, Frankie gets angry, feeling that Phoenix used her for her body.\n\nStudents gossip about Bella and her accusations against Andrew. Bella comes to the Healys' house to talk to Nick, but MJ is the only person at home. MJ tries to comfort Bella by telling her she was also raped in college. Bella asks MJ when she started to feel better after her rape, but MJ doesn't answer. Bella leaves, realizing that it may never get better. Nick comes clean to MJ, telling her he walked in on Andrew raping an unconscious Bella but did nothing and left (\"Predator\"). Nick says he wants to go to the police, but MJ protests, stating it would only ruin his life. When Nick accuses her of selfishness, MJ slaps him.\n\nJo comes to New York to pick up Frankie after she calls them out of desperation, lost, and out of money. Frankie shows little remorse for sleeping with Phoenix since she didn't think her relationship with Jo was exclusive . She tells Jo that she is in love with Phoenix. Jo, enraged that the one person they felt understood them doesn't love them, ends the relationship (\" You Oughta Know \"). At home, MJ overdoses on pills . Steve and Nick find her unconscious (\"Uninvited\"). When Steve gets to the hospital, he is devastated that he didn't know MJ had an addiction and promises her he will be there for her and the family from now on (\"Mary Jane\"). When Nick gets to the hospital, MJ tells him he should report to the police, but Nick reveals he already told them about what happened to Bella. Meanwhile, several students attend the rally that Frankie organized to get justice for Bella. Nick apologizes to Bella, who is angered that people only believed her once Nick came forward (\"No\").\n\nA year has passed, and MJ is writing the Christmas letter again. She writes about the progress being made in their relationships and lives. MJ tells Frankie that she wanted her to feel like every other kid and not be treated differently because of her race, but Frankie tells her that she wouldn't have wanted to fit in with the people in their town (\"Thank U\"). Frankie dares MJ to email the Christmas letter to everyone, despite its frankness about her overdose and her dislike of the culture in their town. MJ sends it, deciding that this will be her last Christmas letter. Jo and Frankie rekindle their friendship, and Jo has a new girlfriend. Frankie and Phoenix are now just friends. Frankie and MJ, Bella and Nick, and Steve and MJ all now appear to have mended their relationships. Everyone acknowledges that their bad decisions all help them learn and become better people (\" You Learn \").",

        "description": "Ernest in Love is a musical with a book and lyrics by Anne Croswell and music by Lee Pockriss .  It is based on The Importance of Being Earnest , Oscar Wilde 's classic 1895 comedy of manners .",
        "synopsis": "In Victorian era London, tradesmen and valets debate the upper class's failure to pay their bills on time, with the tradesmen accusing, and the valets fervently defending, their employers (\"Come Raise Your Cup\").  Lane, a valet, returns home to find his master, Ernest Worthing, rehearsing the proper words to say to Miss Gwendolen Fairfax, to whom he intends to propose that afternoon (\"How Do You Find the Words?\").  Gwendolen, meanwhile, with the help of her maid Alice, is searching for \"The Hat\" that will impress Mr. Worthing enough to elicit a proposal.\n\nErnest visits his friend Algernon Moncrieff, who accuses him of leading a double-life. While in the country, where he lives, Ernest goes by the name of Jack (which he believes to be his real name) and pretends that he has a wastrel brother named Ernest, who lives in London and requires his frequent attention.  Jack must assume a serious attitude for the benefit of his young ward, Cecily, an 18-year-old heiress and granddaughter of Jack's late adoptive father.  When in the city, he becomes the profligate Ernest.  Algernon explains to Jack that he has an imaginary friend named Bunbury who lives in the country and is frequently in ill health: whenever Algernon wants to avoid an unwelcome social obligation, or just get away for the weekend, he \"visits his sick friend\".  He calls this delightful practice \"Bunburying\" (\"Mr. Bunbury\").\n\nGwendolen and her mother Lady Bracknell come to call, and Jack proposes to Gwendolen (\"Perfection\").  She joyously accepts, but Jack is worried that Gwendolen seems to love him largely for his name, Ernest, which she thinks the most beautiful name in the world.  In addition, Gwendolen's mother, the terrifying Lady Bracknell, does not approve of Ernest and is further horrified to learn that he was adopted as a baby after being discovered in a handbag at a railway station (\"A Handbag is not a Proper Mother\").  She advises him to find one or both parents before the season is out.  Meanwhile, Jack's description of his pretty ward Cecily has so appealed to Algernon that he resolves to meet her, in spite of Jack's firm opposition.\n\nAssuming the identity of Ernest, Algernon visits Jack's house in the country.  Cecily has for some time imagined herself in love with the mysterious Ernest, whom Jack has told her is \"A Wicked Man\".  Her governess, Miss Prism, is easily distracted by the attentions of the clergyman Dr. Chasuble (\"Metaphorically Speaking\").  Jack, meanwhile, has decided to put his life as Ernest behind him.  He is forced to abandon his intention to declare that his brother Ernest has died in Paris by the presence of Algernon in the role of \"Ernest\", who threatens to expose Jack's double life if the latter doesn't play along.\n\nLane, the valet, and Cecily's maid Effie, lament the way the upper classes make love so difficult (\"You Can't Make Love\"); as servants, they find it much easier together.  Cecily is swept off her feet by Algernon, and she accepts his proposal (\"Lost\").  Cecily admits to her \"Ernest\" that she loves him at least in part for his name.  Algernon and Jack, unbeknownst to each other, each ask the local rector, Rev Canon Chasuble, to be baptised as \"Ernest\".\n\nGwendolen flees London and her mother to be with her love.  When she and Cecily meet for the first time, she declares that she can always recognize a lady and knows immediately that she and Cecily will be great friends (\"My Very First Impression\").  Upon discussing their engagements, though, each indignantly insists that she is the one engaged to \"Ernest\".  This results in verbal conflict until Jack and Algernon appear and their deceptions are exposed.  Since neither is named Ernest, the girls renounce their engagements and walk away, their noses in the air.  Jack deplores their situation, but Algernon calmly consumes his tea (\"The Muffin Song\").\n\nThe couples soon reconcile when the girls learn of Jack and Algernon's plans to be christened.  They all swear \"Eternal Devotion\".  Lady Bracknell arrives in pursuit of her daughter.  She meets Cecily and finds her as a suitable wife for Algernon, especially when the amount in her trust fund is revealed.  However, Lady Bracknell still refuses to countenance Jack's marriage to Gwendolen, while he, in retaliation, denies his consent to the marriage of his heiress ward Cecily to her penniless nephew Algernon (\"The Muffin Song (reprise)\").\n\nThe impasse is broken by the appearance of Cecily's governess, Miss Prism.  As she and Lady Bracknell recognize each other with horror, it is revealed that, when working many years previously as a nursemaid for Lady Bracknell's late sister, Miss Prism had disappeared with the sister's child, a baby boy.  Miss Prism reveals that, in a moment of distraction, she had placed the baby in a handbag and put the manuscript of a novel she had been writing in the perambulator.  The handbag was left at Victoria station and, when she realised her mistake, Miss Prism had fled.  When Jack produces the handbag in which he was found, it becomes clear that he is Lady Bracknell's nephew and Algernon's older brother.\n\nDr. Chasuble remembers that Jack was named after his father, Ernest John.  Jack, now truly Ernest, receives Gwendolen's forgiveness for the fact that he has been telling the truth all along.  The happy couples embrace, including Miss Prism and her clerical admirer, the Reverend Canon Chasuble (\"Ernest in Love\").",

        "synopsis": "In 2015, The Barden Bellas have been the ICCA National champions for three consecutive years and are now led by senior Beca Mitchell and three-time super senior Chloe Beale.\n\nA national scandal (dubbed \"Muffgate\") erupts when Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart accidentally rips her pants in front of U.S. President Barack Obama during his birthday performance at the Kennedy Center , exposing her genitalia and leading to the Bellas' suspension from the ICCAs.\n\nBeca makes a deal that they can be reinstated should they win the A Cappella World Championship. Freshman Emily Junk hopes to follow in the footsteps of her mother, Katherine, by becoming a Bella. She watches an a cappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Beca's boyfriend Jesse Swanson. Jesse's friend Benjamin \"Benji\" Applebaum, develops a crush on Emily.\n\nThe Bellas learn that German powerhouse group Das Sound Machine (DSM) has replaced them on their victory tour and is favorite to win the Worlds. Beca has secretly started an internship at recording studio Residual Heat, which only Jesse knows (and Fat Amy later discovers).\n\nAs the Bellas' suspension means they cannot hold auditions, Emily goes directly to their sorority house and sings her unfinished song \" Flashlight \". They decide she can join; since she came of her own accord, they technically aren't breaking any rules.\n\nThe Bellas meet DSM when the latter performs at a car show. DSM leaders Pieter Kr\u00e4mer and Kommissar mock the Bellas. Both groups are invited to a riff-off with the Treblemakers, the Tone Hangers (composed of former Treblemakers, including previous leader Bumper Allen, with whom Amy is in a casual relationship), and the Green Bay Packers .\n\nThe Bellas make it to the final two, but lose to DSM when Emily sings \"Flashlight\", violating the rule of no original songs. Bumper asks Amy on a traditional date and to officially be his girlfriend; she refuses. At a practice performance for the Worlds, the Bellas' set ends in disaster when their pyrotechnics set fire to Cynthia Rose's hair.\n\nChloe takes The Bellas on a retreat to rediscover their roots and synchronicity, led by former Bella Aubrey Posen. Beca's internship is revealed, and Beca argues with Chloe over her obsession with the group and accuses the other Bellas of not thinking about their futures. She storms off, only to step into one of the camp's bear traps.\n\nBeca apologizes before being saved by Lilly. The Bellas accept that they will go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing \" Cups \", Beca's audition song for the group.\n\nAmy regrets ending things with Bumper and they reconcile. Beca's boss has been unimpressed with her, so Beca offers to help Emily produce \"Flashlight\". He likes the result and says he looks forward to working with them.\n\nThe senior Bellas graduate and the group heads to Copenhagen for the World Finals. Emily and Benji share a kiss. The Bellas deliver a stripped-down performance ending in a harmonized version of \"Flashlight\" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. They win. As the senior Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated initiation ceremony, with Amy demonstrating the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase.\n\nAs the credits roll, Bumper appears on The Voice and all of the judges turn around.

        "synopsis": "In a flashback to 1979, a young Donna Sheridan graduates from Oxford 's New College with her best friends, Rosie and Tanya (\" When I Kissed the Teacher \"), and dreams of the Greek island Kalokairi. Her mother, Ruby, is a famous singer, but they have a strained relationship as Ruby is always away on tour so she does not attend Donna's graduation. Fed up with her mother's constant absence and determined to spend her life making memories, Donna travels to Kalokairi to find her destiny.\n\nIn the present, Donna's daughter, Sophie, is in Kalokairi preparing the grand reopening of the Hotel Bella Donna in honour of her recently deceased mother. Harry and Bill can't attend due to overseas obligations and Sophie also feels estranged from her husband, Sky, who has been offered a job in New York City (\" One of Us \").\n\nIn Paris, Donna meets the sweet, awkward Harry Bright, who instantly falls in love with her (\" Waterloo \"). They spend the night together, but Donna leaves early for Greece. When she misses her boat to Kalokairi, Bill Anderson gives her a lift in his sailboat , where they dance and flirt (\" Why Did It Have to Be Me? \"). On the way, they help a stranded fisherman named Alexio to go back to shore in time to save the love of his life from marrying someone else. Unbeknownst to Donna, Harry has followed her to Greece, however he arrives too late and she sails off with Bill.\n\nIn the present, Rosie and Tanya arrive and Sophie shows them the renovated hotel (\" I Have a Dream \"). This mirrors the past, when Donna explores the abandoned farmhouse that would eventually become the hotel. A heavy storm then breaks out and Donna discovers a trapped horse, and soothes it with the assistance of Sam Carmichael. In the present, a heavy storm destroys both the decorations and cuts off ferries to Kalokairi, to Sophie's dismay.\n\nSam, who lives in a cabin on the island, reassures Sophie that she can never disappoint her mother, as he once did. Before Sophie was born, Donna and Sam were enjoying a whirlwind romance (\" The Name of the Game \") which ended badly when she discovered he was engaged. Heartbroken, Donna breaks up with Sam and tearfully watches him leave the island (\" Knowing Me, Knowing You \"), while the present Sam reassures Sophie how important she was to her.\n\nFollowing Sam's departure, Donna is visited by Tanya and Rosie, who cheer her up by performing as Donna and the Dynamos (\" Mamma Mia \"). Bill returns to the island, and she joins him on his boat, much to the chagrin of Rosie, who fell for Bill. While they are gone, Sam returns, having ended his engagement for Donna, but is saddened to hear she is with another.\n\nDonna discovers she is pregnant but has no idea which one of her three recent lovers is the father. Bill's great-aunt Sofia overhears Donna's wish to stay on the island and reveals she owns the abandoned farmhouse where she has been staying. Donna happily accepts her offer to stay there, where she later gives birth to Sophie.\n\nIn the present, Sophie tells Rosie and Tanya about her problems with Sky, and Rosie explains how she and Bill broke up (\" Angel Eyes \"). Meanwhile, Bill, Harry, and Sky leave their ventures abroad to support Sophie but are told there are no boats to Kalokairi. However, Alexio recognises Bill so he offers the trio safe boat passage to the island as gratitude for Bill saving his relationship. Bill convinces everyone to join them for the Kalokairi party. When the guests arrive (\" Dancing Queen \"), Bill and Rosie soon reunite over their mutual grief over Donna's death, and Sophie tells Sky she is pregnant and never felt closer to her mother.\n\nThe celebration is suddenly disrupted when Ruby arrives, despite not being invited. Ruby explains that Sky tracked her down, and she wants to build a relationship with her granddaughter. Sophie then performs with the Dynamos in honour of Donna (\" I've Been Waiting for You \"). Ruby is proud, and expresses slight but sincere grief over her daughter's death. Afterwards, the hotel manager, Se\u00f1or Fernando Cienfuegos, reveals that he is Ruby's long-lost lover from 1959, so they are joyously reunited (\" Fernando \").\n\nNine months later, Sophie gives birth to her baby boy, Donny. At the christening , Donna's ghost proudly watches, and they have a final moment before Donna fully passes on (\" My Love, My Life \").

        "synopsis": "Many years ago, orphaned brothers Jehan and Claude Frollo (Frollo) were taken in by Notre Dame. Jehan grew to be mischievous, while Frollo remained pious. After Jehan was caught with a gypsy woman, he was expelled from Notre Dame. Frollo eventually became the archdeacon of the cathedral. One day, Frollo received a letter from Jehan, and the two met in secret. On his deathbed, Jehan gave Frollo his deformed baby before dying. As Frollo prepared to kill the child, he suddenly felt as though he was being tested by God. Instead, he chose to save the child, naming him Quasimodo, meaning \"half-formed,\" and raising him in Notre Dame. As the story progresses, an actor steps forward and assumes the role of Quasimodo, with minor face paint applied to represent his deformity, while the company asks: \"What makes a monster, and what makes a man?\" (\" The Bells of Notre Dame \").\n\nIn the present day (in the year 1482), Quasimodo is now a young man, made partially deaf by a lifetime of ringing Notre Dame's bells. He talks to Notre Dame's statues of saints and gargoyles about his desire to go to the Feast of Fools. Frollo arrives and asks him who he is speaking to, reminding him that the stone statues cannot talk. They recite the biblical story of the Flight into Egypt , after which Frollo complains about Paris's gypsies and the Feast of Fools (\"Sanctuary Part I\"). Quasimodo offers to protect him outside; Frollo declines, warning him that he would be shunned if he were to go out in public (\"Sanctuary Part II\"). Quasimodo sings to himself, yearning to spend one day outside Notre Dame (\" Out There \").\n\nIn the streets of Paris, the Feast of Fools begins, led by Clopin, the gypsy king (\" Topsy Turvy Part I \"). Meanwhile, Captain Phoebus, the new head of Notre Dame's Cathedral Guard, arrives in Paris from the front lines. Frollo welcomes him, telling him they must rid the city of gypsies (\"Rest and Recreation\"). Clopin introduces Esmeralda, a gypsy dancer (\"Rhythm of the Tambourine\")\u2014Quasimodo, Frollo, and Phoebus are all entranced by her. After that, Clopin holds a contest to crown the King of Fools, the ugliest person in Paris. Encouraged by Esmeralda, Quasimodo enters, immediately winning the contest (\" Topsy Turvy Part II \") before being humiliated by the crowd. Esmeralda rescues Quasimodo with a magic trick before Frollo intervenes. He scolds Quasimodo; the two return to Notre Dame, followed by Esmeralda (\"Sanctuary Part III\").\n\nFrollo finds Esmeralda, confronting her; after a brief argument, he relents, allowing her to stay. Esmeralda prays to God to help the less fortunate (\" God Help the Outcasts \"). Phoebus finds Esmeralda; they argue, Phoebus telling her not to fight unwinnable battles, to which she retorts that she cannot help it.\n\nEsmeralda heads to the bell tower, finding Quasimodo there. The two quickly befriend each other (\"Top of the World\"), Quasimodo ringing the bells of Notre Dame for her. Frollo runs up to the tower, angry at Quasimodo for ringing the bells at the wrong time. He is shocked by Esmeralda's presence, thinking she had left. He offers her shelter so he may save her soul, but she rejects his offer, saying that she sees the way Frollo looks at her. This infuriates Frollo, who orders Phoebus to escort her from Notre Dame and arrest her if she sets foot in it again. Frollo warns Quasimodo that Esmeralda is a dangerous person sent from Hell and to ignore any lustful feelings he may feel towards her. Yet, having developed such feelings for Esmeralda himself, Frollo roams the streets nightly, one night discovering Esmeralda, Clopin and multiple other gypsies partying with Phoebus; Frollo is unable to look away as Esmeralda dances and kisses Phoebus (\"Tavern Song (Thai Mol Piyas)\"). Meanwhile, in the bell tower, Quasimodo reflects on seeing couples in love from his tower and how he never thought himself worthy of love until meeting Esmeralda (\"Heaven's Light\").\n\nFrollo prays, begging the Virgin Mary to save him by either condemning Esmeralda to Hell or giving her to him (\" Hellfire \"). The next day, he approaches Louis XI asking for special powers to stop a 'gypsy witch' to protect Paris, which he is granted. With his new powers, he instigates a citywide manhunt for Esmeralda which leads him to a brothel known for hiding gypsies. When the brothel's owner claims ignorance, Frollo orders Phoebus to burn the brothel down, an order which Phoebus defies. As Frollo orders Phoebus's arrest, Esmeralda appears; a fight breaks loose. Amidst the commotion, Frollo stabs Phoebus and frames Esmeralda for it; she uses a magic trick to escape. Frollo continues the hunt, while Quasimodo grows increasingly worried about Esmeralda's whereabouts (\"Esmeralda\").\n\nAct Two\n\nEsmeralda returns to Notre Dame, asking Quasimodo to hide the injured Phoebus. She gives Quasimodo a woven band and leaves. Inspired by the story of Saint Aphrodisius and encouraged by the saints, Quasimodo deciphers the woven band as a map and resolves to help her (\"Flight into Egypt\"). Frollo returns to Notre Dame, asking Quasimodo where Esmeralda is; Quasimodo responds that he doesn't know. Frollo appears to accept this, before a guard informs Frollo that they know where Esmeralda is. Frollo tells Quasimodo that they will now be successful in capturing Esmeralda and leaves (\"Esmeralda (Reprise)\").\n\nUsing the map, Quasimodo and Phoebus go to warn the gypsies (\"Rest and Recreation (Reprise)\"). Initially, the gypsies attempt to kill the two, but they are saved by Esmeralda. (\"Court of Miracles\"). The two tell the gypsies Frollo will attack at dawn. The gypsies prepare to leave; Phoebus asks Esmeralda to go with her, the two expressing their love for each other as Quasimodo looks on, heartbroken (\"Heaven's Light (Reprise)/In a Place of Miracles\"). Frollo suddenly enters, having followed Quasimodo, and arrests all present\u2014only Clopin manages to escape. Frollo has the guards lock Quasimodo in the bell tower.\n\nFrollo visits Esmeralda, telling her that he can save her if she accepts being with him. When Esmeralda refuses, he threatens Phoebus' life and attempts to rape her (\"Sanctuary (Reprise)\"). He halts when Esmeralda cries out in protest, allowing her to have a final conversation with Phoebus. Phoebus pleads for her to accept Frollo's offer to save herself, which Esmeralda refuses to do. They yearn together for a better future (\" Someday \"). Meanwhile, in the bell tower, the statues encourage Quasimodo to free himself and save Esmeralda; Quasimodo angrily denounces them, declaring that he will remain stoic until he dies (\" Made of Stone \").\n\nAt dawn, Esmeralda is tied to a pyre outside Notre Dame. Frollo sentences her to death, offering her one last chance to save herself, which she angrily rejects. He orders her pyre to be lit. Quasimodo swings down on a rope from the bell tower and takes Esmeralda back to Notre Dame, invoking Notre Dame's status as a sanctuary in an appeal for protection. Frollo orders the Cathedral Guard to retake the church by force. Clopin frees Phoebus, after which the two rally the people of Paris to fight against the guards. However, the guards still manage to break in. Quasimodo dumps the molten lead used for fixing the bells onto the guards to stop them. Esmeralda thanks Quasimodo for being a good friend before dying from smoke inhalation. Frollo enters and asks Quasimodo if she is dead, which he broken-heartedly confirms. Relieved, Frollo tells Quasimodo that they are finally free of her poison. Quasimodo angrily throws Frollo off the tower of Notre Dame to his death.\n\nDevastated, Quasimodo realizes that everyone he has ever loved is now dead. Phoebus arrives, finding out about Esmeralda's death. Phoebus tries to carry her body away but is unable to due to his injuries. Quasimodo then carries Esmeralda away.\n\nThe actor playing Quasimodo breaks character and addresses the audience, explaining that years later, two skeletons were discovered in the crypts of Notre Dame, one holding the other in its arms. The first skeleton had a woven band around its neck, while the second had a crooked spine. When an attempt was made to separate them, the latter crumbled to dust. The company then turns to the audience, repeating the question posed at the beginning of the show: \"What makes a monster, and what makes a man?\" (\"Finale\").",

        "description": "Hadestown is a musical with music, lyrics, and book by Ana\u00efs Mitchell . It tells a version of the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice . Eurydice , a starving young girl, goes to work in a hellish industrial version of the Greek underworld to escape poverty and the cold, and her poor singer-songwriter lover Orpheus comes to rescue her.\n\nThe original sung-through version of the musical was performed in Barre and Vergennes , Vermont, in 2006, followed by a tour in Vermont and Massachusetts in 2007. Mitchell, unsure about the future of the musical, turned it into a concept album , released in 2010.\n\nIn 2012, Mitchell met director Rachel Chavkin , and the two reworked the stage version, with additional songs and dialogue. The new version of the musical, directed by Chavkin, premiered off-Broadway at New York Theatre Workshop (NYTW) on May 6, 2016, and ran through July 31. Following productions in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and London, England, the show premiered on Broadway in 2019. The Broadway production received critical acclaim, and at the 73rd Tony Awards it received 14 nominations (the most that year) and won eight, including Best Musical and Best Original Score .",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe Greek god Hermes welcomes the audience to the show, introducing the story, characters, ensemble, and band (\"Road to Hell\"). This is followed by Eurydice and the Fates describing the harsh weather and famine of the setting (\"Any Way the Wind Blows\"). Orpheus , Hermes' ward, introduces himself to Eurydice and asks her to marry him (\"Come Home With Me\"). Eurydice is doubtful as they both live in poverty. Orpheus tells her that he is writing a song to make spring come again, and they will no longer have to struggle (\"Wedding Song\").\n\nPrompted by Hermes, Orpheus tells the story of Hades and Persephone (\"Epic I\"). Persephone arrives in the world above and celebrates summertime (\"Livin' it Up on Top\"), while Eurydice begins to truly fall in love with Orpheus (\"All I've Ever Known\"). Hades comes early to collect Persephone, and she voices her misery of having to return to Hadestown, Hades' underground factory. Despite hearing about the never-ending labor endured by the factory workers, Eurydice is intrigued by the rich praises sung by the Fates as well as the promise of protection that Hadestown offers (\"Way Down Hadestown\"). The cold weather returns and Eurydice searches for food and firewood, urging Orpheus to finish his song (\"A Gathering Storm\"). Orpheus continues working on his song (\"Epic II\"), as Eurydice becomes more desperate as times grow harder.\n\nAfter Persephone and Hades argue (\"Chant\"), Hades leaves Hadestown to find someone who will appreciate its safety and security. He comes across a desperate Eurydice and invites her to come to Hadestown (\"Hey, Little Songbird\") and the Fates urge Eurydice to join him (\"When the Chips Are Down\"). With the cold surging and an empty stomach, Eurydice sees no other choice except following Hades. She bids goodbye to Orpheus before heading to Hadestown as the Fates chastise the audience for judging her for choosing self-interest over love (\"Gone, I'm Gone\"). Orpheus discovers Eurydice's disappearance, and decides to rescue her from Hadestown. He sets off on his journey using Hermes' instructions on how to get to Hadestown without the use of the train (\"Wait for Me\"). Eurydice arrives in Hadestown and signs the contract, officially becoming a worker as Hades revels in his power and dominion over the denizens of his city (\"Why We Build the Wall\").\n\n### Act II\n\nIn an entr'acte , Persephone sings to the patrons of a speakeasy that she runs behind Hades's back (\"Our Lady of the Underground\"). Eurydice begins to realize the consequences of her choice to go to Hadestown: she will soon become a forgotten laborer and can never leave unless Hades consents to let her go (\"Way Down Hadestown (Reprise)\"). She forgets her memories of the world above (\"Flowers\").\n\nOrpheus arrives in Hadestown and promises Eurydice that he will take her home with him (\"Come Home with Me (Reprise)\"). Hades appears and reveals to him that Eurydice willingly signed the contract (which Eurydice regretfully confirms) and orders the workers to attack Orpheus (\"Papers\"). The Fates tell him to give up hope (\"Nothing Changes\"). Orpheus vows to find a way to free Eurydice, rallying the workers and catching Persephone's attention in the process (\"If It's True\").\n\nPersephone is inspired by Orpheus's determination and pleads with Hades to let Eurydice go (\"How Long?\"). While the workers begin to truly question the freedom they were promised, Hades bitterly offers Orpheus a chance to sing his completed song, threatening to kill him afterwards (\"Chant (Reprise)\"). Orpheus sings his song, reminding Hades of his love for Persephone (\"Epic III\"). Hades and Persephone reconcile with a dance (Epic III (\"They Danced...\")), after which Orpheus and Eurydice promise to stay together no matter how hard (\"Promises\"). Orpheus asks Hades if they may leave, and Hades tells him that he has not reached a decision. The Fates taunt Hades for his dilemma: If he kills Orpheus and keeps Eurydice captive, they become martyrs, but if he lets them go, he loses control over his workers as they have begun to agitate for their freedom (\"Word to the Wise\"). Hades decides to let Orpheus and Eurydice go on one condition: Orpheus must lead them out. If he turns around to confirm that Eurydice is following him, she will return to Hadestown and remain there forever (\"His Kiss, the Riot\").\n\nHermes explains the condition to Orpheus and Eurydice, and they begin heading out with the workers looking to them for hope. Persephone and Hades decide to give their relationship another chance (\"Wait for Me (Reprise)\"). Just as Orpheus makes it up to the end, he is overcome by doubt and turns around, condemning Eurydice to return to Hadestown (\"Doubt Comes In\"). Hermes reflects on the somber tale and why it must be told, as the story resets to the beginning and the company begins to tell it again (\"Road to Hell (Reprise)\"). After the bows at curtain call , the cast honors Orpheus for his optimism and bravery (\"We Raise Our Cups\").",

        "description": "Gypsy: A Musical Fable is a musical with music by Jule Styne , lyrics by Stephen Sondheim , and a book by Arthur Laurents . It is loosely based on the 1957 memoirs of striptease artist Gypsy Rose Lee , and focuses on her mother, Rose , whose name has become synonymous with \"the ultimate show business mother .\" It follows the dreams and efforts of Rose to raise two daughters to perform onstage and casts an affectionate eye on the hardships of show business life. The character of Louise is based on Lee, and the character of June is based on Lee's sister, the actress June Havoc .\n\nThe musical contains many songs that became popular standards, including \" Everything's Coming Up Roses \", \" Rose's Turn \", \" Small World \", \" Together (Wherever We Go) \", \" You Gotta Get a Gimmick \", and \" Let Me Entertain You \".\n\nIt is frequently considered one of the crowning achievements of the mid-twentieth century's conventional musical theatre art form, often called the book musical . Gypsy has been referred to as the greatest American musical by numerous critics and writers, among them Ben Brantley (\"what may be the greatest of all American musicals...\") and Frank Rich . Rich wrote that \" Gypsy is nothing if not Broadway's own brassy, unlikely answer to King Lear .\" Theater critic Clive Barnes wrote that \" Gypsy is one of the best of musicals...\" and described Rose as \"one of the few truly complex characters in the American musical.\"",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nBaby June and Louise, the two daughters of Rose Hovick, play the vaudeville circuit around the United States in the early 1920s. Rose, the archetype of a stage mother , is aggressive and domineering, pushing her children to perform. While June is an extroverted, talented child star, the older girl, Louise, is shy. Their act has one song, \" May We Entertain You \", with June always as the centerpiece and Louise in the background. Rose has big dreams for the girls but encounters setbacks when her father refuses to lend her money for those dreams (\"Some People\"). When Rose meets a former agent, Herbie, she persuades him to become their manager using her seductive and feminine wiles (\" Small World \"). Through Herbie's efforts, \"Baby June and Her Newsboys\" becomes a top vaudeville act.\n\nAs the girls grow into adolescents, June and her act have a chance to perform for Mr. Goldstone of the Orpheum Circuit (\"Mr. Goldstone, I Love You\"). Meanwhile, Louise celebrates her birthday alone and wonders how old she is (\"Little Lamb\"). Rose rejects Herbie's marriage proposal and he considers leaving, but she asserts that he could never get away from her (\"You'll Never Get Away From Me\"). After an audition for T.T. Grantziger (\"Dainty June and Her Farmboys/Broadway\"), June is offered a place at a Performing Arts school. However, Rose turns this down, refusing to break up the act. Louise and June fantasize what life would be like if Rose were married and finished with show business (\"If Momma Was Married\").\n\nA few months later, still on the road from show to show, Tulsa, one of the boys from the act, confides to Louise that he has been working on his own act and Louise fantasizes that she and he could do the act together (\"All I Need Is the Girl\"). Shortly after this, June is missing, and she explains in a note that she has grown sick of her mother and the endless tour and has eloped with Tulsa, with whom she will do a new act. Rose is hurt, but she optimistically vows that she will make Louise a star, proclaiming that \" Everything's Coming Up Roses \".\n\n### Act II\n\nLouise is now a young woman, and Rose has built a pale imitation of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell \"Madame Rose's Toreadorables\" to a fading vaudeville industry. However, they are still together (\" Together, Wherever We Go \").\n\nWith no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a burlesque house in Wichita, Kansas , as a means to deter police raids. Rose is anguished, as she sees what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks' pay for the new act is better than unemployment. Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on what it takes to be a successful stripper, a \"gimmick,\" something that \"makes your strip special\" (\" You Gotta Get a Gimmick \").\n\nOn the last day of the booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for solicitation . Desperate, Rose cannot resist the urge to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the striptease as a last-minute replacement. Herbie is disgusted at how low Rose has stooped and he finally walks out on her (\"Small World\" (Reprise)). Although reluctant, Louise goes on, assured by Rose that she needn't actually strip but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old vaudeville song \"May We Entertain You\". She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her audience, which becomes her \"gimmick\". Louise becomes secure, always following her mother's advice to \"Make 'em beg for more, and then don't give it to them!\" With each performance, the song becomes brasher and brassier, and Louise removes more articles of clothing. Ultimately, she becomes a major burlesque star (\" Let Me Entertain You \").\n\nAt Louise's dressing room, Rose argues with her daughter, now known as the sophisticated \"Gypsy Rose Lee\". Embittered, Rose reveals that the true motivation for all her actions has been to live vicariously through her daughters so she can chase the stardom she wanted for herself, not for her children. She realizes that she has driven away June, Herbie, and now possibly Louise. She displays the talent that could have been under different circumstances, as the name \"Rose\" flashes in neon lights (\" Rose's Turn \"). After her admission to Louise, mother and daughter tentatively move toward reconciliation in the end.",

        "songs": "### Notes on songs\n\nDuring the pre-Broadway tryout tour, several songs were cut, including a song for Herbie called \"Nice She Ain't\" (cut because it was given to Jack Klugman one week prior to opening and he could not memorize the keys and staging in time), and a song for Baby June and Baby Louise titled \"Mama's Talkin' Soft\". The latter song was cut partly because the staging required the little girls to stand on a platform elevated above the stage, which terrified the young actress playing Baby Louise and partly because the show was running too long. \"Mama's Talkin' Soft\" was later recorded by Petula Clark and released as a single in the UK in 1959. Other cut songs include \"Mother's Day\", a song for Baby June's act, \"Smile, Girls\", which involves Rose trying to teach the untalented girls to smile in order to make the act look good, \"Who Needs Him?\", which Rose sings to herself after Herbie leaves her, and \"Three Wishes for Christmas\", a burlesque number similar to one that would be performed at Minsky's Burlesque .",

        "description": "Suffs is a musical with music, lyrics, and a book by Shaina Taub , based on suffragists and the American women's suffrage movement , focusing primarily on the historical events leading up to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920 that gave some women the right to vote.\n\nThe show premiered off-Broadway at The Public Theater in April 2022. It opened on Broadway on April 18, 2024, at the Music Box Theatre , where it received mostly positive reviews from critics. It was nominated for six Tony Awards , including Best Musical , winning two, for Best Book and Best Score .",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nAt the 1913 National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) Convention, Carrie Chapman Catt gives a speech calling for support for women's suffrage (\"Let Mother Vote\"). Alice Paul , exhausted by NAWSA's slow progress, proposes a march on Washington, D.C. on the day of President Woodrow Wilson 's inauguration, to pressure him to support a federal amendment for suffrage. Carrie refuses, preferring NAWSA's approach of gaining suffrage state-by-state. Irritated and unwilling to give up, Alice resolves to see equality for all achieved in her lifetime (\"Finish the Fight\"). She recruits her college friend Lucy Burns to help organize the march themselves, and they further recruit socialite Inez Milholland and Polish labor organizer Ruza Wenclawska , and accept visiting Nebraska college student Doris Stevens as their secretary (\"Find a Way\"). As the march approaches, Southern delegations object to Black women marching alongside white women in their respective delegations. Not wanting to derail the march, Alice elects to compromise by setting up a separate colored women delegation; prominent African-American journalist and activist Ida B. Wells confronts the organizers to declare her intention to march with her own state delegation, and harshly criticizes Alice for being willing to compromise with the march's Southern backers at the expense of Black women (\"Wait My Turn\").\n\nOn the morning of the march, Ida runs into her friend and fellow Black activist Mary Church Terrell , along with her daughter Phyllis . Ida favors direct actions to draw attention, while Mary prefers an approach of \"dignified agitation\", working within the system to fight for colored women's rights, which causes a rift between them, though they both march with the hope of uplifting Black voices (\"Terrell's Theme\"). The Woman Suffrage Procession faces some violent pushback, but they succeed in completing the march (\"The March (We Demand Equality)\"). As the organizers celebrate, Doris expresses distress over having been called a \"bitch\" by one of the counter-protestors. Alice, Ruza, Inez, and Lucy encourage Doris to embrace this label as a sign of her strength in the face of sexist men (\"Great American Bitch\"). Carrie offers NAWSA's backing to the newly-formed Congressional Union (CU) for Woman Suffrage , made up of the march's organizers, although she and Alice still disagree on their respective approaches. The CU go to the White House for a meeting with Wilson, who offers them lip service about his condescending and chauvinistic adoration for women (\"Ladies\"), but continually puts off publicly showing support in his first term. A frustrated Alice suggests NAWSA withdraw their support, but Carrie refuses to antagonize Wilson as he has pledged to keep the U.S. out of the war in Europe .\n\nAlice's commitment to the movement takes a toll on her personal and social life, but she tells herself focusing on achieving women's suffrage will be worth the sacrifice (\"Worth It\"). Doris educates Wilson's chief of staff Dudley Field Malone on the movement by offering a hypothetical scenario of her rights if they were husband-and-wife; the two gradually fall for each other (\"If We Were Married\"). At the 1916 NAWSA Convention the divisions among the Suffs become clear; Mary, an invited speaker, wants to use her speech to highlight race, while Ida points out that NAWSA uses Mary to insulate themselves from being called racist. The CU disrupts the convention by publicly calling for NAWSA to organize against Wilson's reelection, criticizing the slower approach of \"irrelevant old fogies\" like Carrie (\"The Convention Part 1\"). Stunned and offended at having her contributions to the movement brushed aside (\"This Girl\"), Carrie publicly condemns Alice and privately informs her that her actions have no place in NAWSA (\"The Convention Part 2\"). With the CU effectively kicked out of NAWSA, Alice founds the National Woman's Party (NWP) and recruits Alva Belmont , a wealthy socialite and NAWSA donor, to fund it and continue with their anti-Wilson efforts (\"Alva Belmont\"). The NWP plans a campaign tour calling for women in states where they have voting rights to vote against Wilson. Inez tries to take a leave of absence due to exhaustion, but is convinced by Alice to go on the tour (\"Show Them Who You Are\"). Their efforts to vote Wilson out are unsuccessful and Wilson is re-elected (\"The Campaign\"); to make matters worse, a devastated Lucy returns from the tour with the news that Inez collapsed and died during one of her speeches, having hidden her anemia from the others. Heartbroken, the Suffs hold a vigil for Inez, and resolve to continue in her honor (\"How Long?\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe NWP organize the Silent Sentinels , standing in silence outside the White House gates until Wilson publicly supports suffrage. When Wilson declares that the U.S. will join the Great War, they hold up banners with his own words printed on them to highlight his hypocrisy, only to be arrested on Wilson's orders (\"The Young Are At The Gates\") and sentenced for the trumped up charge of obstructing traffic. Dudley, disgusted with Wilson and convinced of the cause, publicly resigns (\"Respectfully Yours, Dudley Malone\"). At Occoquan Workhouse , the group stages a hunger strike to protest their arrest, much to the frustration of Mrs. Herndon, the strict but sympathetic prison matron. The group soon falls into conflict as Ruza accuses Alice of trying to get them all killed with her methods, with Lucy and Doris unable to quell the argument (\"Hold It Together\"). Meanwhile, Carrie continues to back Wilson despite misgivings about his broken promises and treatment of the suffragists in prison. Dudley helps free Doris from prison by posing as her husband and joins the NWP. Mary argues with Ida about publicly condemning the war, as both express their fatigue over constantly fighting for Black women's rights and being ignored at every turn (\"Wait My Turn (reprise)\"). The strikers smuggle letters out of the prison with the help of Mrs. Herndon, describing the horrific abuse by prison staff; Wilson publishes press reports contradicting the letters (\"The Report\"). As Alice slowly starves to death in solitary confinement, she is met by prison staff member Dr. White, who threatens to have her committed if she continues striking. A hallucination of Inez confronts Alice, warning she will be no good to the wider movement if she dies (\"Show Them Who You Are (reprise)\"). Taking Inez's advice, Alice tells Dr. White she is willing to be called insane so long as it is known she is still fighting for what she believes in, and ends her hunger strike (\"Insane\"). White is moved by her words and refuses to have her committed, despite Wilson's orders.\n\nDoris leaks the letters to the press, forcing Wilson to free the rest of the strikers. As the NWP burn Wilson in effigy after the war, a frustrated Carrie tells him that his broken promises have alienated even his less-radical base in NAWSA, and that he can easily quell dissent by supporting suffrage and publicly giving the credit to NAWSA (\"Fire & Tea\"). Wilson finally does so, but snidely reminds Carrie they still need enough state legislatures to ratify the amendment (\"Let Mother Vote (reprise)\"). In 1920, on the morning of the final vote for the Nineteenth Amendment in Tennessee, Carrie and Alice run into each other. At first they passive-aggressively blame each other for their struggles, but Carrie has an epiphany when she realizes that she was once the young upstart in the suffrage movement to the more conservative Susan B. Anthony , and that Alice chose the path of forceful resistance that Carrie had left behind (\"She and I\"). The Nineteenth Amendment vote comes down to a single vote from Senator Harry T. Burn , who is convinced to change his vote from a \"Nay\" to an \"Aye\" at the last minute after receiving a telegram from his mother, Phoebe, who reveals that she blames Wilson for her husband's death in the War but lacks the ability to vote against him (\"A Letter From Harry's Mother\"). Ida and Mary celebrate their success, but sadly agree that Black women will still be prevented from voting , just as Black men; Phyllis encourages them to keep faith that the movement will continue. The other women celebrate the amendment's passing (\"I Was Here\"); as Dudley and Doris plan to wed, Carrie invites her professional and romantic partner Mollie Hay to join her on a diplomatic trip abroad, as they lament that they do not have the freedom to truly live as a married couple (\"If We Were Married (reprise)\").\n\nAlice pitches the NWP's next goal of getting the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) passed. However, the entire group is exhausted and decide to quit organizing: Doris plans to publish her memoirs about her experiences in the movement; Ruza wants to act on Broadway (\u201cAugust 26th, 1920\u201d). Lucy decides to retire from activism, though she assures Alice she values their shared fight (\"Lucy's Song\"). In the 1970s, an aged but still active Alice meets young activist Robin (played by the actress who played Phyllis), a representative from National Organization for Women who seeks Alice's support on radical movements. Alice disagrees with Robin's call for an intersectional approach, preferring the singular focus on the ERA, but is taken aback when Robin accuses her of being behind in her ways and points out how the 19th Amendment didn't make voting easier for Black women (\"Finish the Fight (reprise)\"). Realizing she has become the \"old fogey\" that Carrie was to her, Alice accepts she will not live to see the end of the fight for equality, but declares that it will happen one day so long as people maintain their resolve (\"Keep Marching\").",

The evening follows a reunion of the Weismann Girls who performed during the interwar period . Several of the former showgirls perform their old numbers, often accompanied by the ghosts of their younger selves. The score offers a pastiche of 1920s and 1930s musical styles, evoking a nostalgic tone.\n\nThe original Broadway production, directed by Harold Prince and Michael Bennett , with choreography by Bennett, opened April 4, 1971.

The musical has had a number of major revivals, and several of its songs have become standards , including \"Broadway Baby\", \" I'm Still Here \", \"Too Many Mornings\", \" Could I Leave You? \", and \" Losing My Mind \".",
        "synopsis": "In 1971, on the soon-to-be-demolished stage of the Weismann Theatre, a reunion is being held to honor the Weismann's Follies shows past and the beautiful chorus girls who performed there every year between the two world wars. The once resplendent theater is now little but planks and scaffolding (\"Prologue\"/\"Overture\"). As the ghosts of the young showgirls slowly drift through the theater, a majordomo enters with his entourage of waiters and waitresses. They pass through the spectral showgirls without seeing them.\n\nSally Durant Plummer, \"blond, petite, sweet-faced\" and at 49 \"still remarkably like the girl she was thirty years ago\", a former Weismann girl, is the first guest to arrive, and her ghostly youthful counterpart moves towards her. Phyllis Rogers Stone, a stylish and elegant woman, arrives with her husband Ben, a renowned philanthropist and politician. As their younger counterparts approach them, Phyllis comments to Ben about their past. He feigns a lack of interest; there is an underlying tension in their relationship. As more guests arrive, Sally's husband, Buddy, enters. He is a salesman, in his early 50s, appealing and lively, whose smiles cover inner disappointment.\n\nFinally, Weismann enters to greet his guests. Roscoe, the old master of ceremonies, introduces the former showgirls (\"Beautiful Girls\"). Former Weismann performers at the reunion include Max and Stella Deems, who lost their radio jobs and became store owners in Miami ; Solange La Fitte, a coquette, who is vibrant and flirtatious even at 66; Hattie Walker, who has outlived five younger husbands; Vincent and Vanessa, former dancers who now own an Arthur Murray franchise; Heidi Schiller, for whom Franz Leh\u00e1r once wrote a waltz (\"or was it Oscar Straus ?\" Facts never interest her; what matters is the song!); and Carlotta Campion, a film star who has embraced life and benefited from every experience.\n\nAs the guests reminisce, the stories of Ben, Phyllis, Buddy, and Sally unfold. Phyllis and Sally were roommates while in the Follies, and Ben and Buddy were best friends at school in New York. When Sally sees Ben, her former lover, she greets him self-consciously (\"Don't Look at Me\"). Buddy and Phyllis join their spouses and the foursome reminisces about the old days of their courtship and the theater, their memories vividly coming to life in the apparitions of their young counterparts (\"Waiting For The Girls Upstairs\"). Each of the four is shaken at the realization of how life has changed them. Elsewhere, Willy Wheeler (portly, in his sixties) cartwheels for a photographer. Emily and Theodore Whitman, ex-vaudevillians in their seventies, perform an old routine (\"The Rain on the Roof\"). Solange proves she is still fashionable at what she claims is 66 (\"Ah, Paris!\"), and Hattie Walker performs her old showstopping number (\"Broadway Baby\").\n\nBuddy warns Phyllis that Sally is still in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben's apparently glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made the right choices and considers how things might have been (\"The Road You Didn't Take\"). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) that she is happily married. (\"In Buddy's Eyes\"). However, it is clear that Sally is still in love with Ben \u2013 even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside.\n\nPhyllis interrupts this tender moment and has a biting encounter with Sally. Before she has a chance to really let loose, they are both called on to participate in another performance \u2013 Stella Deems gets Sally, Phyllis, Emily, Hattie, and some others to perform an old number (\"Who's That Woman?\"), as they are mirrored by their younger selves. Afterward, Phyllis and Ben angrily discuss their lives and relationship, which has become numb and emotionless. Sally is bitter, having never been happy with Buddy, although he has always adored her. She accuses him of having affairs while he is on the road, and he admits he has a steady girlfriend, Margie, in another town, but always returns home. Carlotta amuses a throng of admirers with a tale of how her dramatic solo was cut from the Follies because the audience found it humorous, transforming it as she sings it into an anthem-like toast to her own hard-won survival (\" I'm Still Here \").\n\nBen confides to Sally that his life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips between them and the three move together (\"Too Many Mornings\"). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy watches from the shadows. Sally thinks this is a sign that the two will finally get married, and Ben is about to protest until Sally interrupts him with a kiss and runs off to gather her things, thinking that the two will leave together. Buddy leaves the shadows furious, and fantasizes about the girl he should have married, Margie, who loves him and makes him feel like \"a somebody\", but bitterly concludes he does not love her back (\"The Right Girl\"). He tells Sally that he's done, but she is lost in a fantasy world and tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him. Buddy tells her she must be either crazy or drunk, but he's already supported Sally through rehab clinics and mental hospitals and cannot take any more. Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover and coolly turns him down. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs \"One More Kiss\", her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self. Phyllis kisses a waiter and confesses to him that she had always wanted a son. She then tells Ben that their marriage can't continue the way it has been. Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this, but still wants Phyllis out of his life. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request (\" Could I Leave You? \").\n\nPhyllis begins wondering at her younger self, who worked so hard to become the socialite that Ben needed. Ben yells at his younger self for not appreciating all the work that Phyllis did. Both Buddys enter to confront the Bens about how they stole Sally. Sally and her younger self enter and Ben firmly tells Sally that he never loved her. All the voices begin speaking and yelling at each other. Suddenly, at the peak of madness and confusion, the couples are engulfed by their follies, which transform the rundown theater into a fantastical \"Loveland\", an extravaganza even more grand and opulent than the gaudiest Weismann confection: \"the place where lovers are always young and beautiful, and everyone lives only for love\". Sally, Phyllis, Ben, and Buddy show their \"real and emotional lives\" in \"a sort of group nervous breakdown\".\n\nWhat follows is a series of musical numbers performed by the principal characters, each exploring their biggest desires. The two younger couples sing in a counterpoint of their hopes for the future (\"You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through\"). Buddy then appears, dressed in \"plaid baggy pants, garish jacket, and a shiny derby hat\", and performs a high-energy vaudeville routine depicting how he is caught between his love for Sally and Margie's love for him (\"The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues\"). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past \u2013 and her obsession with him now (\" Losing My Mind \"). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated and her desire to combine them (\"The Story of Lucy and Jessie\"). Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy (\"Live, Laugh, Love\"), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis.\n\n\"Loveland\" has dissolved back into the reality of the crumbling and half-demolished theater; dawn is approaching. Ben admits to Phyllis his admiration for her, and Phyllis shushes him and helps Ben regain his dignity before they leave. After exiting, Buddy escorts the emotionally devastated Sally back to their hotel with the promise to work things out later. Their ghostly younger selves appear, watching them go. The younger Ben and Buddy softly call to their \"girls upstairs\", and the Follies end.",

        "description": "Jekyll & Hyde is a 1990 musical based on the 1886 novella The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde by Robert Louis Stevenson . Originally conceived for the stage by Frank Wildhorn and Steve Cuden , it features music by Frank Wildhorn , a book by Leslie Bricusse and lyrics by all of them. After a world premiere run in Houston, Texas , the musical embarked on a national tour of the United States prior to its Broadway debut in 1997.

        "synopsis": "The majority of the show's story has not changed from production to production, but many of the songs have been altered, cut or replaced since the show debuted.\n\n### Act I\n\nThe audience is introduced to John Utterson and Sir Danvers Carew, both having been associated with Doctor Henry Jekyll . Utterson was Jekyll's lawyer and best friend while Sir Danvers was Jekyll's future father-in-law. The two gentlemen take the audience back some time to find Jekyll in an insane asylum singing of his comatose father (\"Lost in the Darkness\"). It is Jekyll's belief that the evil in his father's soul has caused his illness. Jekyll tells the audience about his passion to find out why man is both good and evil and his attempts to separate the good from the evil (\"I Need to Know\").\n\nSome time later, the rich and poor of 19th century London describe how people act \u2013 how they want others to see them, no matter who they really are inside (\"Fa\u00e7ade\"). Afterward, Jekyll presents a research proposal to the Board of Governors of St. Jude's Hospital. Sir Danvers, the chairman of the board, is in attendance along with His Grace Rupert the 14th Bishop of Basingstoke , the Right Honorable Sir Archibald \"Archie\" Proops, Lord Theodore \"Teddy\" Savage, Lady Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Beaconsfield, General Lord Glossop and Simon Stride, the secretary. All, with the exception of Sir Danvers, already deem the proposal an inconvenience. When Jekyll proposes to test his theory and his formula on a human subject (presumably his father), they scorn the proposal with cries of \"sacrilege, lunacy, blasphemy, heresy\", voting five to none with Sir Danvers' one abstention (\"Board of Governors\"). Utterson tries to calm Jekyll down, knowing that he is obsessed over his father's condition. Jekyll feels that he could \"save\" those who have fallen in the same darkness. Utterson urges his friend, if he feels he is right about his theory, that he should continue (\"Pursue the Truth\").\n\nLater that night, a group of high society Londoners turns up at Sir Danvers' residence at Regent's Park , which has a well-maintained fa\u00e7ade. Sir Danvers throws a showy party for his daughter Emma, for her engagement to Dr. Jekyll, to which Jekyll is late. (\"Fa\u00e7ade\" (reprise #1).  During the party, the guests \u2013 which include the Governors and Stride, deride Danvers and Emma for her engagment to a \"madman\", but Utterson, Sir Danvers and Emma back up Jekyll. Stride, who has feelings for Emma, speaks to Emma in private and tries to reason her out of her engagement, but she quickly turns him down, saying she feels she can be who she wants to be with Jekyll (\"Emma's Reasons\").\n\nJekyll arrives late as usual \u2013 just before the party leaves to go see the fireworks \u2013 and shares a moment with Emma. Though he warns her he may always be busy with his work, Emma swears she will be beside him through it all (\"I Must Go On/Take Me as I Am\"). Sir Danvers returns as Jekyll leaves and expresses to Emma that he considers Jekyll like a son to him but finds it difficult to tolerate his behavior at the cost of losing his daughter. Emma assures him that he will never lose her, and they should not be afraid to let go (\"Letting Go\").\n\nJekyll and Utterson later go to the dregs of Camden Town known as \"The Red Rat\" for Jekyll's bachelor party (\"Fa\u00e7ade (reprise #2)\"). Prostitute Lucy Harris arrives late and is in for some trouble with the boss, known as 'Spider', but she dismisses it for now. Despite her position in life, she is seen to be kind-hearted and well-liked by her co-workers but has moments of contemplation about her life (\"No One Knows Who I Am\").\n\nGuinevere, the German manager of \"The Red Rat\", then breaks Lucy's reverie and then sends her out onstage to do her number (\"Bring on the Men\" or \"Good 'N' Evil\" depending on the production), which captivates Jekyll. After the number, Lucy begins to circulate among the clientele. Spider approaches Lucy and after striking her hard across the face, threatens to kill her if she is late again. Jekyll approaches Lucy after witnessing the Spider's actions and intends to help her as Utterson is led away by another bar girl. Jekyll and Lucy are drawn to each other in a way that promises each of them a great friendship. Jekyll admits Lucy's song has helped him find the answer to his experiment. Utterson reemerges, and Jekyll tells Lucy that he must be on his way. Before he goes, he gives Lucy his visiting card and asks her to see him should she ever need a friend (\"Lucy meets Jekyll\").\n\nAs Utterson and Jekyll arrive at the latter's residence, Utterson notices that Jekyll is in a better mood. Jekyll informs him that he has found a subject for his experiments. Utterson recommends that Jekyll go straight to bed and departs. Jekyll dismisses his butler, Poole, for the night and proceeds to his laboratory, excited that the moment has come to conduct his experiment (\" This Is the Moment \"). Keeping tabs on the experiment in his journal, Jekyll mixes his chemicals to create his formula, HJ7, and injects it into the subject: himself (in some versions, he drinks the formula, as he did in the book). After a minute of the potion's side effects, he writhes in pain, and is taken over by an alternate, aggressive personality (\"First Transformation\"). With grim humor he notes in his journal \"4:00 AM -A few slight changes\" (the exact line varies, depending on the production). He gleefully goes out and roams the streets, taking in the sights and sounds of London while tormenting innocent bystanders, which includes a sexually abusive encounter with Lucy (\u201cLucy meets Hyde\u201d). Jekyll's alternate personality gives himself a name: Edward Hyde (\"Alive\").\n\nA week later, no one has heard anything from Jekyll. Emma, Sir Danvers and Utterson ask Poole where he is, but Emma decides to leave and believes Jekyll will come for her after his work is finished. After Emma and Sir Danvers leave, Poole tells Utterson that Jekyll has been locked in his lab all this time and that he has heard strange sounds from the lab. Jekyll, who seems distraught, emerges and impatiently sends Poole to fetch some chemicals for him. Utterson confronts Jekyll about his bizarre behavior, but Jekyll brushes this off. He instead gives Utterson three letters: one for Emma, another for her father, and one for Utterson himself should Jekyll become ill or disappear. Suspicious and concerned, Utterson warns Jekyll to not let his work take over his life. Meanwhile, Emma and Sir Danvers argue about the prudence of Emma's marriage to a man who seems to be falling into an ever-deepening abyss. Emma again tells her father that she understands that Jekyll's work is important (\"His Work and Nothing More\").\n\nAfter Utterson departs, Lucy arrives at Jekyll's residence with an aggressive bruise on her back. As Jekyll treats her wound, she tells him a man named Hyde inflicted it. Jekyll is stunned by this revelation but hides it. Feeling compassion for Jekyll for being kind to her, Lucy kisses him (\"Sympathy, Tenderness\"). Disturbed by his own actions, Jekyll leaves Lucy, who wonders about her love for him (\"Someone Like You\").\n\nLater, the Bishop of Basingstoke is seen with Guinevere after having a \"meeting\" with one of her underage attendants. He pays Guinevere and arranges to see the attendant next Wednesday. When Guinevere and the attendant leave, Hyde appears holding a swordstick with a heavy pewter knob. After insulting the Bishop, Hyde proceeds to beat and stab him to death with the swordstick before gleefully setting the body aflame (\"Alive (reprise)\").\n\n### Act II\n\nUtterson and Sir Danvers speak to the audience once again of past events with Jekyll: Utterson begins to feel he was not able to help his poor client and friend, while Danvers senses that something was horribly wrong with his work, as he had not been seen or heard from for weeks.\n\nThe citizens of London gossip about the bishop's murder as Hyde hunts down and kills General Glossop, Sir Proops, Lady Beaconsfield, and Lord Savage. By now, all five Governors who rejected Jekyll's proposal are dead (\"Murder, Murder\"). Later one night, Emma lets herself into Jekyll's laboratory. She finds his journal open and reads one of his entries. Jekyll enters and immediately closes the journal, preventing her from learning what he has become. Emma can see he is distraught. She professes her love for him and begs him to confide in her (\"Once Upon a Dream\"). He tells her nothing of his work, but says he still loves her. After Emma leaves, Jekyll writes in his journal that Hyde has taken a heavy toll on him and those around him, and that the transformations are occurring of their own accord. His entry is interrupted when Utterson arrives at the lab, seeking to find out who Jekyll's sole heir is, Edward Hyde, as referred to in Jekyll's letter. Jekyll only tells him that Hyde is a \"colleague\" involved in the experiment. Utterson can see that his friend is desperately ill and agrees to obtain the rest of the chemicals Jekyll requires. Jekyll, once again alone, begins to face the fact that Hyde is a part of him (\"Obsession\"). At the same time, both Lucy and Emma wonder about their love for the same man (\"In His Eyes\").\n\nAt \"The Red Rat\", Nellie and Lucy consider their profession and why they keep doing it (\"Girls of the Night\"). Lucy is then visited by Hyde, who tells her that he is going away for a while. He then warns her to never leave him. Lucy is terrified, but seems to be held under a sexual, animalistic control by Hyde (\"Dangerous Game\"). As they leave together, Spider addresses the \"Red Rat\" attendants, warning them to always be aware of what dangers lie ahead in the East End (\"Fa\u00e7ade (reprise #3)\").\n\nUtterson comes to Jekyll's lab with the rest of the chemicals and a secret envelope and discovers Hyde, who informs him that the doctor is \"not available\" tonight. Utterson refuses to leave the package with anyone but his friend and demands to know where he is. Hyde replies that even if he told him, Utterson would not believe him. Utterson insists on seeing Jekyll, threatening to alert the police otherwise. Hyde angrily attempts to attack Utterson who threatens him with his swordstick. Trapped, Hyde injects the formula into himself, roaring with laughter as he reverts to Jekyll in front of an appalled Utterson. Jekyll tells Utterson that Hyde must be destroyed, whatever the cost. He then begs Utterson to deliver money for Lucy so she can escape to safety. As Utterson leaves, Jekyll mixes in chemicals and injects the new formula, fearing that he might lose himself forever, and praying that he can restore his former life (\"No One Must Ever Know\").\n\nUtterson visits Lucy at \"The Red Rat\" with the money, along with a letter from Jekyll that entreats her to leave town and start a new life elsewhere. After Utterson leaves, Lucy wonders of the possibilities ahead (\"A New Life\"). Just then, Hyde returns. Seeing the letter from Jekyll, he tells Lucy that he and the doctor are \"very close\" and that they \"share everything\". In some versions Hyde reveals that he feels that Lucy has betrayed him by being in love with Jekyll and by going to see him every day. He then calls Lucy over to him and holds her very close. As he holds Lucy softly so that she does not suspect it, he slowly, angrily and savagely stabs her multiple times before slitting her throat (\"Sympathy, Tenderness (reprise)\"). The vile murderer runs off laughing, just as the \"Red Rat\" attendants find Lucy's body and carry her out on a stretcher. Covered in Lucy's blood, Jekyll returns to his laboratory and faces off with Hyde in a final battle for control (\"Confrontation\").\n\nLater, Utterson tells the audience that Jekyll had given up his task of \"finding the truth\", condemning his father to the darkness. Yet, as Sir Danvers would put it, the doctor had returned at \"the sound of wedding bells\" (\"Fa\u00e7ade (reprise #4)\"). Several weeks later, Jekyll seems to have regained control as he and Emma stand before the priest at their wedding in St. Anne's Church. As the Minister begins the ceremony, Jekyll doubles over in pain and transforms into Hyde. Hyde then kills Simon Stride, a guest at the wedding, before taking Emma hostage. At the sound of Emma's pleading voice, Jekyll is able to regain momentary control. He begs Utterson to kill him, but Utterson cannot bring himself to harm his friend. Desperate, Jekyll impales himself on Utterson's swordstick. Emma weeps softly as Jekyll dies, finally free of Hyde's evil control (\"Finale\").\n\n### Notes\n\n(*) \"I Need to Know\" was removed for the 1997 Broadway production but featured in all other productions (in some cases it replaces \"Lost in the Darkness\"). (**) \"Bring On the Men\" was replaced by \"Good 'N' Evil\" for the Broadway production only; it was re-instated in all subsequent productions. (***) For the Broadway production only, \"Streak of Madness\" was shortened and re-titled \"Obsession\"; it was re-instated in full for all subsequent productions.\n\nFurther note: In subsequent productions following Broadway, reprises #1, #2 and #4 of \"Fa\u00e7ade\" are usually removed (henceforth what was \"Fa\u00e7ade (reprise #3)\" on Broadway, effectively becomes the sole \"Fa\u00e7ade (reprise)\"). Also, in certain productions, songs featured on the 1994 Concept recording have been re-instated, i.e. \"The World Has Gone Insane\" and \"The Girls of The Night\" on the Concert tour, and several foreign productions.",

The years pass, and it is 1913. The soldier has become an old one-legged veteran preparing to march in the annual Confederate Memorial Day parade (\"The Old Red Hills of Home\"). As the parade begins (\"The Dream of Atlanta\"), Leo Frank, a Jewish man from Brooklyn , New York, is deeply uncomfortable living here due to his religion, college education and the cultural differences between the North and South (\"How Can I Call This Home?\"). His discomfort spills into his relationship with his wife Lucille, a more assimilated Jewish Georgian, who has planned an outdoor meal spoiled by Leo's decision to go in to work on a holiday. Meanwhile, two local teens, Frankie Epps and Mary Phagan , ride a trolley car and flirt. Frankie wants Mary to go to the movies with him, but Mary playfully resists, insisting her mother will not let her (\"The Picture Show\").  Mary, who has recently been laid off, leaves to collect her final paycheck from the pencil factory managed by Leo.\n\nLucille bemoans the state of her marriage, feeling unappreciated by a man so wrapped up in himself and unfulfilled in life; she wonders whether Leo was the right match for her (\"Leo at Work\" / \"What Am I Waiting For?\"). Mary arrives in Leo's office to collect her paycheck. That night, police Detective Starnes and Officer Ivey rouse Leo from his sleep, and without telling him why, demand he accompany them to the factory, where Mary has been found raped and murdered in the basement. The police immediately suspect Newt Lee, the African-American night watchman who discovered the body (\"Interrogation\"). Lee, under interrogation, maintains his innocence, but he inadvertently directs Starnes' suspicion upon Leo, who did not answer his telephone when Lee called him to report the incident. Leo is arrested, but not charged. Mrs. Phagan, Mary's mother, becomes aware of Mary's death.\n\nReporter Britt Craig sees in Mary's murder the possibility of a career-making story (\"Big News\"). Craig attends Mary's funeral, where the townspeople of Marietta are angry, mournful, and baffled by the shattering tragedy (\" There is a Fountain \" / \"It Don't Make Sense\"). Frankie and Tom Watson , editor of The Jeffersonian , an extremist right-wing newspaper, swear revenge on Mary's killer (\"Tom Watson's Lullaby\"). Governor John Slaton pressures the local prosecutor Hugh Dorsey to get to the bottom of the crime. Dorsey, an ambitious politician with a \"lousy conviction record\", together with Starnes and Ivey, interrogate Newt Lee, learning nothing. Dorsey releases Newt, reasoning that \"hanging another Nigra ain't enough this time. We gotta do better.\" He blames Leo and sends Starnes and a reluctant Ivey to find eyewitnesses (\"Something Ain't Right\"). Craig eagerly begins an effective campaign vilifying Leo (\"Real Big News\").\n\nLeo meets with his lawyer Luther Z. Rosser, who vows to win the case. Meanwhile, Dorsey makes a deal with factory janitor and ex-convict Jim Conley to testify against Leo in exchange for immunity for a previous escape from prison. Lucille, hounded by reporters, collapses from the strain and rebukes Craig when he attempts to obtain an interview (\"You Don't Know This Man\"). She tells Leo that she cannot bear to see his trial, but he begs her to stay in the courtroom, as her absence would make him look guilty.\n\nLeo's trial begins, presided over by Judge Roan. A hysterical crowd gathers outside the courtroom, as Watson spews invective (\"Hammer of Justice\") and Dorsey begins his prosecution (\"Twenty Miles from Marietta\"). He produces a series of witnesses, most of whom give trumped evidence fed to them by Dorsey. Frankie testifies, falsely, that Mary said Leo \"looks at her funny\", a sentiment echoed verbatim by three of Mary's teenage co-workers, Iola, Essie and Monteen (\"The Factory Girls\"). In a fantasy sequence, Leo becomes the lecherous seducer they describe (\"Come Up to My Office\"). Mary's mother testifies (\"My Child Will Forgive Me\"), and the Franks' housekeeper Minnie McKnight claims Leo came home in an agitated state the night of the murder and that his marriage to Lucille was abusive. The prosecution's star witness, Jim Conley, claims that he witnessed the murder and helped Leo conceal the crime (\"That's What He Said\"). Leo is desperate. As Dorsey whips the courtroom into a frenzy, Leo delivers a heartfelt statement, pleading to be believed (\"It's Hard to Speak My Heart\"), but it is not enough. He is found guilty and sentenced to hang. The crowd breaks out into a jubilant cakewalk as Lucille and Leo watch, terrified (\"Summation and Cakewalk\").\n\n### Act II\n\nIt's now 1915, as Leo appeals the case. The northern press strongly disapproves of the way the trial was conducted, as African-American domestics wonder if the reaction would have been as strong if the victim had been Black (\"A Rumblin' and a Rollin'\"). Lucille tries to help Leo with his appeal but reveals crucial information to Craig, leading to an argument between herself and Leo (\"Do it Alone\"). She finds Governor Slaton at a party (\"Pretty Music\") to advocate for Leo, accusing Slaton of being a fool or a coward if he accepts the verdict. Meanwhile, Watson tells Dorsey that he will support his bid for governor if he makes one. Dorsey and Judge Roan go on a fishing trip, where they discuss the political climate and the upcoming election (\"The Glory\").\n\nThe governor re-opens the case, and Leo and Lucille rejoice (\"This Is Not Over Yet\"). Slaton visits the factory girls, who admit to their exaggeration (\u201cFactory Girls\" (reprise)), and Minnie, who says Dorsey intimidated her and made her sign a statement (\u201cMinnie McKnight's Reprise\u201d). Slaton also visits Jim Conley, who is in jail as an accessory to the murder. Conley sticks to his story despite its noticeable inconsistencies with the evidence, and along with his Chain Gang, refuses to give Slaton any information (\"Blues: Feel the Rain Fall\"). A year later, after deliberation, Slaton commutes Leo's sentence to life in prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, a move that ends his political career. The citizens of Marietta, led by Dorsey and Watson, are enraged and riot (\"Where Will You Stand When the Flood Comes?\").\n\nLeo is at a prison work-farm. Lucille visits, and he realizes his deep love for his wife and how much he has underestimated her (\"All the Wasted Time\"). Later, a party of masked men (including Starnes, Ivey, Frankie, and the Old Confederate Soldier) arrive and kidnap Leo. They take him to Marietta and demand he confess to the murder on pain of death. Leo refuses, and although Ivey is convinced of his innocence, the group prepares to kill him. As his last request, Leo has a sack tied around his waist, since he is wearing only his nightshirt, and asks Ivey to give his wedding ring to Lucille. The group hangs him from an oak tree (\"Sh'ma\"). Eight months later, on Confederate Memorial Day 1916, a remorseful Britt Craig gives Leo's ring, which has been delivered to him anonymously, to Lucille. He is surprised that she has no plans to leave Georgia, now governed by Dorsey, but she refuses to let Leo's ordeal be for nothing. Alone, she gives in to her grief, but takes comfort in believing that Leo is with God and free from his ordeal. Outside, the annual Memorial Day Parade begins (\"Finale\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nPrince Eric , his nautical expert Pilot, and his advisor, Grimsby, and sailors are aboard a ship at sea, discussing the \"mythical\" merfolk that supposedly live under the sea. Grimsby wants Eric to return to court to fulfill his birthright as king. However, Eric hears a beautiful voice and commands it to be followed (\"Fathoms Below\") .\n\nDeep on the ocean floor in the merfolk kingdom, a concert in honor of a thwarted coup d'\u00e9tat by the sea witch Ursula is underway, being performed by the daughters of King Triton , the ruler of the sea. King Triton's court composer, Sebastian the crab, has composed a song for the girls to perform (\"Daughters of Triton\") . However, the youngest daughter, Ariel , is not there for her solo, bringing the concert to a halt. Ariel has forgotten about the concert and is swimming around the surface, admiring a new item for her collection, a fork. She reveals that she is fascinated with the human world (\"The World Above\") . Together with her best friend Flounder , Ariel visits Scuttle and his fellow seagulls to ask about the human things she's collected, and he explains them somewhat erroneously (\"Human Stuff\") .\n\nElsewhere, Ursula is seeking revenge against her brother, King Triton. She was banished from the palace for using black magic, and tells her minions Flotsam and Jetsam to keep an eye on Ariel, whom she thinks will be the key to getting the crown and trident (\"I Want the Good Times Back\") .\n\nWhen Ariel returns home, King Triton is angered to learn that she has been on the surface and reprimands her: King Triton is xenophobic towards humans, believing them to be nothing but savage fish-eaters. Ariel rushes off distraught, and King Triton assigns Sebastian to watch over Ariel to make sure she doesn't get into trouble. Ariel sits alone in her grotto, which contains her collection of human things, and imagines living in the human world (\"Part of Your World\") . Ariel and Flounder meet Scuttle at the surface to see Prince Eric's ship up close. On board, Grimsby tells Eric that he must find a bride and take his place as king. A storm suddenly hits, and Eric is tossed overboard. Ariel saves him from drowning and drags him to shore. She realizes that she is falling in love with him, and vows to find a way to be with him (\"Part of Your World (Reprise)\") .\n\nAfter Ariel returns home, her behavior makes her sisters and Flounder suspect that she has fallen in love (\"She's in Love\") . On land, Eric is determined to find the woman who saved his life, but the only clue he has is (\"Her Voice\") . Sebastian reveals to King Triton that Ariel has saved a human. Triton angrily confronts her about it (\"The World Above (Reprise)\") , uncovers her grotto and uses his trident to destroy Ariel's human collection. After the king leaves, Sebastian tries to comfort Ariel by pointing out the wonders of the undersea world (\"Under the Sea\") , but she is disappointed with him for reporting to her father and sneaks off with Flounder during the song. Once she is away, she is stopped by Flotsam and Jetsam, who sweet talk her into seeking help from Ursula (\"Sweet Child\") .\n\nAriel goes to meet Ursula, who presents a deal: Ariel will be turned into a human for three days, during which she has to win the kiss of true love from Eric. If she does, she will be human permanently; if not, her soul will belong to Ursula. In exchange, Ariel must give up her voice, which will stay in Ursula's magic nautilus shell (\"Poor Unfortunate Souls\") . Ariel signs the agreement and sings into the shell, after which she is transformed into a human and swims up to the surface.\n\n### Act II\n\nSebastian and Flounder bring Ariel, newly human, to shore. Scuttle and the seagulls give her a pep talk to raise her spirits and help her get used to her new legs (\"Positoovity\") . Eric arrives, but when Ariel tries to talk to him, she cannot speak. Eric brings Ariel back to his palace, where Carlotta, the head mistress, and the maids bathe and dress Ariel. Ariel is fascinated by the human world, while the maids wonder why Eric has brought such a girl to the palace (\"Beyond My Wildest Dreams\") . That night Chef Louis cooks dinner for Ariel, Grimsby, and Eric, and almost cooks Sebastian for the grand finale (\"Les Poissons\"/\"Les Poissons (Reprise)\") .\n\nEric and Ariel spend time together, during which Eric teaches her to dance (\"One Step Closer\") . Meanwhile, Ursula is anxiously waiting for the three days to end and sends Flotsam and Jetsam to hurry things along (\"I Want the Good Times Back (Reprise)\") . After a tour of the kingdom, Eric takes Ariel on a quiet boat ride through a lagoon. Sebastian and Scuttle watch anxiously and try to create a romantic atmosphere for Eric to kiss Ariel (\"Kiss the Girl\") . As they are about to kiss, Flotsam and Jetsam give the boat an \"electric shock\", scare the animals away, and swim away gloating (\"Sweet Child (Reprise)\") . As the second day ends, Ariel wishes she had more time and could tell Eric everything, Triton worries about where his daughter has gone and vows to change if she were to return, Sebastian is concerned that Ariel's time as a human is almost up, and Eric still dreams of finding the girl who saved him even though he does not want to lose Ariel (\"If Only (Quartet)\") . Sebastian returns to the sea and tells an angry King Triton about Ariel's deal with Ursula.\n\nOn Ariel's last day as a human, Grimsby has arranged a contest for all foreign princesses to sing for Eric, so he may choose one for his bride (\"The Contest\") . Eric isn't interested in any of them, and Ariel asks to participate, dancing for him. Eric picks her, but before they can embrace, Ursula appears, declaring that the sun has set and Ariel now belongs to her. Flotsam and Jetsam grab Ariel to take her back to the sea. King Triton arrives to confront his sister, agreeing to take Ariel's place. Ursula claims the trident and declares herself queen (\"Poor Unfortunate Souls (Reprise)\") . She banishes Triton with a wave of the trident. During a battle with Eric's ship, Ariel grabs Ursula's nautilus shell and regains her voice (which causes a horrified Flotsam and Jetsam to swim away). Ursula begs Ariel to return the shell to her, as her power is contained within it, and even tries to sweet-talk her into doing so, saying she can turn her human again and reunite her with her prince. Ariel is torn, but ultimately destroys the shell just in time, which destroys Ursula and restores King Triton to his throne and daughter.\n\nEric and Ariel are reunited on the beach, and Eric asks King Triton for his blessing to marry Ariel. King Triton says that it is Ariel's place to answer, and she accepts Eric's proposal. King Triton then says goodbye to his daughter (\"If Only (Reprise)\") . In honor of his daughter, Triton declares peace between the humans and merfolk. Ariel and Eric are married and sail away on a ship (\"Finale\") .",

        "title": "The Glorious Ones",
        "description": "The Glorious Ones is a musical with book and lyrics by Lynn Ahrens and music by Stephen Flaherty . Set in 17th-century Italy, it concerns a theatre group in the world of commedia dell'arte and theatre of the Italian Renaissance .\n\nAfter premiering in Pittsburgh in April 2007, the musical opened Off-Broadway in October 2007.",
        "synopsis": "As the curtains part, seven actors appear in commedia dell'arte costumes, on a little stage, moving in a dreamlike recreation of their old roles. Flaminio Scala , the leader of the troupe, begins the story, transporting us back to a beautiful spring day in Venice.\n\nSuddenly, we are on a piazza, as the Glorious Ones, set up a stage and introduce us to their bawdy style of comedy. (\"The Glorious Ones\"). They tell us that much of their comic routines were improvised, and Flaminio Scala illustrates with a slapstick version of his early life, in which he demonstrates how he was raised by monks and later thrown onto the street. There, the endless parade of humanity inspires him to create a new kind of theater\u2014masked the Commedia dell'arte .\n\nWe meet Armanda Ragusa, a dwarf, who is madly in love with the dashing Flaminio. She steals little mementos of her idol\u2014his lost buttons, one of his old stockings, posters, etc.--and keeps them in a sack under her bed. She and Flaminio rehearse a comic sketch about a little dog. They are interrupted by the leading lady, Columbina , who is Flaminio's mistress. She is sick of waiting for him and sick of his antics. (\"Making Love.\") By the time the number is over, he has seduced her once again.\n\nWe next meet Pantalone , who was once a tailor but now plays the roles of the old misers in the troupe's plays. (\"Pantalone Alone.\") He and Armanda commiserate about their lovelorn states (\"The Comedy of Love\"). Dottore Graziano , the \"quack doctor\" in their skits, has sold Pantalone a love elixir, but it hasn't worked\u2014Columbina still doesn't love him.\n\nTheir backstage dilemmas are mirrored onstage in a comic show-within-the show, \"The Comedy of Love,\" in which Flaminio Scala always ends up with the female \"love interest,\" after almost committing comic suicide with a rubber sword.\n\nThe next day, Flaminio Scala discovers Francesco Andreini , a talented young comic, who is performing on the street. Flaminio takes him under his wing, (\"The Glorious Ones - Reprise\") and before long they are like father and son. Flaminio teaches Francesco what it means to be an actor (\"Madness to Act\") but Francesco lets us know that he's more ambitious than he may appear. (\"Absalom.\") During the course of this song, Flaminio gets an idea from the many patches on Francesco's clothes\u2014he creates a patchwork costume for a new character-- Arlecchino , the clown\u2014and gives his young protege this featured role.\n\nThe quack Dottore tries frantically to get onto the stage but is prevented by an invisible wall. In mime, he manages to find a way to get through, and then happily insults the audience in Latin . At last he introduces the next adventure for The Glorious Ones--\"The Invitation to France,\" and they embark on a whirlwind trip, filled with travails, to perform for the French Court (\"Flaminio Scala's Historical Journey to France\"). Flaminio is convinced that their lowbrow humor will enchant the King, make their fortunes, and cement his reputation as a theatrical genius for all time.\n\nOnce in France , their performance for the King begins with three vulgar \"lazzi\" or comic routines, which lead up to the most bawdy piece of all, \"Armanda's Tarantella ,\" featuring the little dwarf, all the men, and a series of double-entendres!. But instead of glory and fame, the response of the religious court is to throw them out of France. Flaminio is angry and humiliated before his troupe, but rallies them to his side once again with his artistic vision. (\"Improvisation.\") The only one not convinced is Francesco.\n\nLights come up on a beautiful young noblewoman named Isabella. We learn that she writes stories against her parents' wishes. (\"The World She Writes.\") Francesco notices her and gets her to come down from her balcony. She shows him a play she has written, \"The Moon Woman,\" and soon they have discovered they are kindred spirits, born to play \"Opposite You.\" They elope, and Isabella joins the troupe. All the men are enamored of her. Armanda is jealous, but Columbina understands how men are. In \"My Body Wasn't Why,\" she sings about her passionate love affair with Flaminio, which led her to be his leading lady. But during the course of the song, Flaminio tells her she is now too old to play that role, that he is giving it to the fresh-faced Isabella. Columbina must settle for the role of the comic maid.\n\nThe Glorious Ones perform the second play-within-a play. It is still \"The Comedy of Love,\" Flaminio is still the leading man who nearly kills himself, but now Isabella is the leading lady . During the performance, Isabella and her husband Francesco play a trick on Flaminio, and suddenly the clownish Arlechino becomes the leading man.\n\nAfter the show, Flaminio is furious at the trick, but Columbina tells him to deal with the fact that he's too old to play the role of the lover. She had to. Flaminio has \"Flaminio Scala's Ominous Dream\" in which he fantasizes that Isabella and Francesco are leading him astray and trying to destroy him.\n\nThe actors tease each other backstage. Francesco presents Isabella's play to them, and suggests they try it, implying that their roles will be fuller than the stereotypes they play every night. Flaminio is drunk and enraged by this challenge to his authority. But the troupe votes to try the new play. In his drunken state Flaminio sees the troupe mocking him and deriding his \"Rise and Fall.\" But in the end, he goes along with it, agreeing to play the grotesque, comic character of Captain Spavento.\n\nBefore the performance of \"The Moon Woman,\" Columbina and Flaminio prepare to go onstage. Flaminio is depressed, but Columbina suggests maybe they should finally retire and settle down together. \"There's more to life than theater,\" she tells him, and he seems to agree.\n\nThe Glorious Ones present \"The Moon Woman,\" now dressed in more elegant masks and costumes. The play is stilted and poetic, nothing like their old, freewheeling slapstick. Flaminio tries to play his part, but can't. He throws off his mask and begins to improvise. The cast can't help themselves\u2014they join him. At last, he pretends to kill himself for love as he always did, staggers around and falls. Columbina falls to her knees, praying comically for him, but suddenly realizes that the blood is real and that Flaminio is indeed dead.\n\nAs the actors grieve, mystified by his terrible act, Flaminio rises and looks back on his life, and the beauty of doing something of worth. (\"I Was Here\").\nArmanda arrives at the monastery where Flaminio was raised, bringing with her \"Armanda's Sack.\" One by one, all the Glorious Ones light up, remembering their glory days in the theater with Flaminio Scala.\n\nAt last, they arrive in Heaven, where Flaminio awaits them, and we are back to our opening image\u2014stars, clouds, a little stage. They look down through a window in the sky, and see Armanda's sack being disposed of. But they are not forgotten. Instead, a \"film projector\" begins to flicker, and they see a parade of comic icons\u2014 Lucille Ball , Buster Keaton , Charlie Chaplin , etc.\u2014they realize their comedy has survived the centuries and exists today. The curtain closes as the Glorious Ones explode into joyous peals of laughter.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe Darling nursery\n\nAs Mr. and Mrs. Darling prepare for an evening out, two of their children, Wendy and John, play at being their parents. When Mrs. Darling notices Michael is left out, she gets him into the game and joins in with all of them watched by the dog Nana,  their nursemaid . When Mr. Darling comes in to have his tie tied, he questions having a dog as a nursemaid, but Mrs. Darling defends her. The previous week, while the children slept, Nana saw a boy in the room who flew out of the window before she could catch him, leaving behind his shadow, which Mrs. Darling has put away in a drawer. In spite of this, Mr. Darling still insists on Nana spending the night downstairs tied up. Mrs. Darling and the children sing a lullaby (\"Tender Shepherd \").\n\nThe children fall asleep. A fairy , Tinker Bell , and Peter Pan fly in through the window to look for his shadow. Wendy is awakened by the boy's cries when he is unable to re-attach his shadow and helps him by sewing it back on. Peter is thrilled when his shadow is re-attached (\"I've Gotta Crow\") and tells her that he lives in Neverland (\"Never Never Land\") with the Lost Boys. Peter gives her a \"kiss\" (a button) that Wendy puts around her neck after giving him a \"kiss\" (a thimble). Wendy wakes her brothers up, and Peter invites them all to Neverland, and promises to teach them to fly. Peter happily launches himself into the air (\"I'm Flying\").\n\nPeter sprinkles the children with fairy dust and tells them to \"think lovely thoughts\" (\"I'm Flying \u2013 Reprise\"). The children follow Peter, but Michael goes back when the maid, Liza, comes into the room, giving her some of his fairy dust and inviting her to come to Neverland with them. In later Broadway revivals, the Liza scene is replaced with Peter and the Darling children flying over London on their way to Neverland.\n\n### Act II\n\nNeverland\n\nIn Neverland, Peter's \"Lost Boys\" are standing outside their underground lair, wondering when he will return, when they hear Captain Hook and his pirates (\"Pirate March\"). The boys hide. Hook tells Smee, his right-hand man, that he wants to kill Peter, because he cut off his hand and threw it to a crocodile , which has since then developed a taste for Hook and follows him around. He had to replace his hand with a hook . Luckily for Hook, the crocodile has swallowed a clock that ticks and alerts Hook to its presence. Hook accidentally stumbles upon the entrance to the hideout, and summons Smee and his men to provide background music while he plans the Boys' demise (\"Hook's Tango \"), a rich cake with poisonous icing. Hook suddenly hears a loud tick-tock; the crocodile appears but Hook escapes. The pirates flee, and the Boys reappear, thinking they are safe. Suddenly, a group of \"Indians\" appears, led by Tiger Lily (\"Indians\"). They leave the Boys alone, and go on hunting the pirates.\n\nThe Lost Boys suddenly spot Wendy in the sky and thinking she is a bird, one of them shoots an arrow. Peter, Michael and John land  and think the arrow lodged in her heart, but instead find it stuck in the button Peter gave her and she is not dead. The Lost Boys build a house around her, hoping that she will become their mother (\"Wendy\"), to which, when she wakes up, she agrees. Hook plants the cake, but Wendy doesn't let the children eat it as she knows it wouldn't be good for them; instead, she tells the Boys stories, including Cinderella . Hook is infuriated that the Boys have found a mother. He plots to kidnap Wendy and the Boys, while Smee and the pirates play another song \"Hook's Tarantella \". After the pirates leave for their ship, Liza arrives and dances with the animals of Neverland while Peter keeps watch outside the house.\n\nA few days pass with everyone having adventures. One day in the forest, after Peter leads the Boys in their anthem (\"I Won't Grow Up\"), they almost run into the pirates, who have captured Tiger Lily and tie her to a tree. Peter hides and mimics Hook's voice, ordering the men to release her. When Hook arrives, he is enraged and demands that the \"spirit of the forest\" speak to him. Peter tricks them all into thinking he is Hook, and that the real Hook is a codfish. Hook asks the \"spirit\" to reveal its true identity. Peter obliges, pretending to be a \"beautiful lady\" (\"Oh, My Mysterious Lady\") and Hook and his pirates try to ambush Peter, but they are chased away by Tiger Lily and her tribe of Native Americans.\n\nBack at the hideout, Tiger Lily and her tribe are almost shot by the Boys, until Peter reveals the truce between them. They smoke a peace pipe and vow eternal friendship (\"Ugg-a-Wugg\"). Tiger Lily and her Indians leave to stand guard around the house above. Wendy asks Peter to sing the Boys a lullaby (\"Distant Melody\") based on the classic fairy tale Cinderella . Michael and John want to return home, and Wendy admits to being homesick, too. The Boys wish they had parents, and Wendy offers hers to all of them. Everyone is excited about being adopted, except Peter, who says he will not go because he knows he will grow up if he does. Wendy tells him she will come back once a year to do his spring cleaning .\n\nThe pirates attack and subdue the Indians. They give Peter a fake all-clear signal, so Peter sadly sends Wendy, her brothers, and the Lost Boys on their way. Before she leaves, Wendy sets out Peter's \"medicine\" (a drop of water) for him to take before bed. After she tearfully leaves, Peter, who pretended not to care, throws himself on a bed and cries himself to sleep.  As they leave the underground house, Wendy and the boys are captured by the pirates. Hook then sneaks into the lair and poisons Peter's \"medicine\". Tinker Bell awakens Peter, tells him of the ambush, and warns him about the poison, but he waves her off as he prepares for a rescue. Desperate, she drinks the poison herself. Dying, she tells Peter that if every boy and girl who believes in fairies would clap their hands, she would live. Peter asks the audience to believe and clap their hands. They do, and Tinker Bell is saved. Peter grabs his dagger and heads off to rescue Wendy and the Boys.\n\n### Act III\n\nThe Jolly Roger\n\nHook revels in his success (\"Hook's Waltz \"). As the plank is prepared, Hook hears the tick-tock of the crocodile and panics. It is actually Peter with a clock, and while Hook cowers Peter and the Boys help the Indians, the animals and Liza onto the ship and hide. Peter hides in a closet and kills two pirates Hook sends in. A third pirate, Starkey, refuses to obey Hook's order to go in and jumps overboard. The pirates then carry the Boys in, and the Boys pretend to be afraid as they are carried in. Peter disguises himself as a pirate, and the pirates think the \"doodle-doo\" (named so because Peter still crows after killing the pirates) killed all the Boys. Hook believes the ship is now cursed, and everyone thinks Wendy is the source. The pirates push Wendy to the plank. Peter ditches his disguise and the Indians and animals attack, as well as the Boys who are alive and armed. The pirates are all defeated, and Peter challenges Hook to a duel and defeats him. Hook threatens to blow up the ship with a bomb, but runs into the real crocodile (whom Peter also brought on the ship). Peter catches the dropped bomb and tosses it in the sea after Hook slides down the plank (which is shaped like a slide) with the crocodile chasing behind him. As Peter puts his fingers in his ears, the bomb explodes and Hook is eaten by the crocodile. Everyone sings Peter's praises (\"Finale: I've Gotta Crow\" [reprise]). Before the Darling children and the Lost Boys go to London, Liza asks Peter to teach her to crow (\"Finale: I've Gotta Crow\" [2nd reprise]).\n\nBack home, the Darlings sit by the nursery window night after night, hoping for the return of their children. The children silently reappear and sing to their mother (\"Tender Shepherd\" [reprise]). The Darlings happily agree to adopt the Lost Boys (\"Finale: We Will Grow Up\"). Wendy promises to wait for Peter, hoping that one day he will return for her.\n\nYears pass, and Peter returns to the nursery, surprising a much older Wendy, who no longer expected him. He has come to take her to Neverland for Spring cleaning, but she declines as she is now grown up; married with a daughter of her own, Jane. Peter starts to cry, and Wendy leaves the room at the sound of her husband's offstage voice. Jane awakes and, like her mother before her, asks, \"Boy, why are you crying?\" Peter introduces himself, but Jane knows all about him from her mother's stories. She has been waiting for him to come take her to Neverland and to learn to fly. Peter, now happy again, throws fairy dust on her, but as they are about to leave, Wendy tries to stop them, saying, \"Oh, if only I could go with you!\" In the most poignant moment of the show, Peter answers with a sad but understanding smile, \"You can't. You see, Wendy ... you're too grown up\" and so Wendy reluctantly lets Jane go, \"just for Spring cleaning.\" Her daughter and the \"boy who wouldn't grow up\" fly off into the night as Wendy watches from the window. (\"Finale: Never Never Land [Reprise]\")",

        "synopsis": "### Prologue\n\nThe musical opens with Lucie Manette as a child, en route from France to England.  She is delivered by Mr. Jarvis Lorry, an employee of Tellson's Bank to the home of Miss Pross, who had been nanny to Lucie's now-deceased mother. Later, Mr. Lorry returns to the Pross household to tell the now-adult Lucie that her father, Dr. Alex Manette, has been found alive in the Bastille after 17 years ( Prologue: The Shadows of the Night ).\n\n### Act 1\n\nDr. Manette, Lucie and Lorry set sail for England and meet Charles Darnay. Upon arriving, Darnay is arrested as a spy as he is discovered in possession of papers showing British troop placements.  It is later found that the papers were dropped by John Barsad, henchman of Darnay's uncle, the Marquis St. Evermonde's ( Dover ). Lucie requests that Mr. Lorry arrange for a lawyer to defend Darnay in exchange for the kindness he has shown her and her father during their journey and Lorry agrees.\n\nWe are then taken to the law office of Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton - who arrives clearly intoxicated ( The Way it Ought to Be - London ). Carton decides with his friend, grave robber Jerry Cruncher, to attempt to blackmail Barsad by visiting several local taverns ( No Honest Way ). The next day, the trial commences ( The Trial ).  Darnay is acquitted after the blackmail attempt  succeeds and prompts the key witness to assert that Darnay and Sydney look similar after Sydney removes his barrister's wig and robe.  The witness then admits it could have been either man-or anyone else-with those papers.\n\nDarnay takes Sydney and Stryver out to celebrate at a tavern that Sydney calls \"home.\" ( Round and Round ) After Darnay is insulted by Sydney and leaves, Sydney reflects on why he acted this way ( Reflection ).\n\nSeveral months have passed and Darnay now desires Lucie's hand but asks her father's permission first ( The Promise ). On Christmas Eve, Lucie attempts to convince Sydney to have supper with she and her father, but he declines; out of kindness, she invites him to dinner the following evening, which he must accept. Awakened by her kindness, Sydney realizes what he has been missing in his life ( I Can't Recall ).\n\nThe next day Darnay asks Lucie to marry him and she accepts ( Now at Last ). Sydney arrives and Lucie gives him his gift - a scarf. Unaware that he would be receiving one, Sydney tells Lucie to close her eyes and kisses her. Shocked, she informs him that Mr. Darnay has asked her hand in marriage. Upset - and embarrassed \u2014 Sydney leaves and reflects on the life he now cannot attain, and on the marriage and life of Darnay and Lucie together ( If Dreams Came True ).\n\nThe action then switches over to France, where the king is expected to drive his carriage past Defarge's wine shop.  Many children are very excited however near the road.  One, the son of a man named Gaspard, is killed when the Marquis St. Evremonde's carriage passes. Madame Defarge, who was unaware of what the children were waiting for, expresses disgust for the death the Marquis has caused and urges Gaspard to murder him ( Out of Sight Out of Mind ). Gaspard later follows the Marquis to his chateau and does so.\n\nDarnay receives a letter from Gabelle, a former house servant in France, and agrees to defend him in the courts and leaves ( Gabelle's Letter/I Always knew ). Stryver and Sydney visit the Manet household one evening and Stryver tells of the killings and other developments there. During their visit, Sydney agrees to help put Little Lucie to bed ( Now I Lay Me Down To Sleep ). Meanwhile, a funeral is being held for Gaspard's son ( Little One ). At the funeral, officers come to arrest Gaspard for murder, but Ernest Defarge tells him to remain and the revolution begins ( Until Tomorrow ) Darnay is arrested when it is revealed that he is the Marquis' nephew.  Lucie is devastated and turns to Sydney for guidance as Darnay left without explanation or revealing his true identity.\n\n### Act 2\n\nAct 2 opens with the storming of the Bastille. The Defarges have found the notes left by Dr. Manette in his cell so many years before, but the people of Paris are still unsatisfied after the prison's fall ( Everything Stays the Same ).\n\nDarnay is sent to trial because he is a member of the aristocracy. At his trial, Madame Defarge reads Dr. Manette's charges against the Marquis St. Evremonde and his brother, who is Charles' father.  At the end of his journal, Manette condemns them and all their descendants.  Manette himself makes an impassioned plea to recant this and say that Darnay is nothing like his father and uncle.  He adds that Darnay's execution would inflict a further burden on him and Lucie who suffered so greatly during his imprisonment. \nManette's plea is denied and Darnay is sentenced to death. ( The Tale ).\n\nLucie is depressed that Darnay has left without telling her why.  Sydney at first is tempted to steal her from her husband, but realizes rather that the right thing would be to help Darnay ( If Dreams Came True [Reprise] ). Lucie wishes to die with her husband, but she realizes this may put her daughter in the same position she was in as a child.  She vows to save both her husband and family yet still questions why Darnay left for France without telling her ( Without a Word ).\n\nSydney makes arrangements with his old acquaintance Barsad to allow him entrance into the prison where Darnay is held ( The Bluff ). Realizing that he cannot simply escape with Darnay, Sydney concocts a plan to save him, and to allow Little Lucie to have her father and a brilliant life ahead ( Let Her Be a Child ).\n\nIn Darnay's prison, after denying that he loves Lucie, Sydney switches clothes with Darnay and then drugs him, to the surprise of Barsad. Barsad delivers the unconscious Charles to Telson's Bank, where his family is waiting. Lucie believes it is Sydney who has returned and reads a letter from him which is delivered by Barsad. In the letter, he explains he had to do this and that she has meant more to him than anything else in his entire life ( The Letter ).\n\nWith both sadness for Sydney and joy for the opportunity for her life with Charles, Lucie and her family quickly leaves France. Madame Defarge arrives armed and vows to not let any of the Evremonde family escape.  She and Miss Pross struggle over the pistol and Madame is killed. Ernest learns of Madame's death and calls-off the massive hunt for the Evremondes to have the opportunity to mourn his wife ( Defarge Goodbye - Lament ).\n\nOn the way to the gallows, a friendly and innocent seamstress realizes that Sydney is not  Darnay, with whom she was imprisoned. However instead of betraying him, she calls him an angel and the two console each other. When she is called to the guillotine, Sydney bids her a final goodbye. He is next and as he climbs the stairs, he realizes the good that he has done for the woman who opened his eyes to so much love ( Finale - I Can't Recall [Reprise] ).",

        "synopsis": "Ten characters in a quasi\u2013 Greek chorus inform the audience of the zany plot twists to come. One of them, a man wearing dark glasses and silk pyjamas, is murdered (\"Something Funny's Going On\").\n\nEnglish shoe salesman Harry Witherspoon spends his Friday night taking inventory in a shoe shop, dreaming of a better life. Arriving at his shabby apartment, run by a mean-spirited landlady, he receives a telegram summoning him to a solicitor 's office (\"Mr. Witherspoon's Friday Night\"). There, Harry learns that Anthony Hendon, an American uncle that he never met, has left him six million dollars. However, to receive the estate, Harry must take the corpse of his Uncle Anthony on an all-expenses paid \"vacation\" to Monte Carlo. Uncle Anthony's embalmed body is in a wheelchair and has been dressed to appear alive. Harry must fulfill the tasks specified by his uncle's will, or the money will go to his uncle's favorite charity, the Universal Dog Home of Brooklyn . Harry reluctantly accepts the terms of the will. He travels to Monte Carlo with the cassette tape that contains his instructions, a mysterious heart-shaped box, and his uncle's corpse in the wheelchair.\n\nMeanwhile, in Atlantic City , optometrist Vinnie DiRuzzio is suddenly visited by his distressed, legally blind sister Rita LaPorta. She shows him a news article: \"English shoe salesman has inherited six million dollars from his casino manager uncle.\" Rita tells Vinnie that due to her poor eyesight she accidentally shot her lover Tony. Tony was the manager of her husband Nicky's casino, and she had suspected that Tony was cheating on her. Rita explains that, with the help of Tony, she embezzled six million dollars' worth of diamonds from her husband. The heart-shaped box that contained the diamonds has disappeared. She also confesses that she has blamed this embezzlement on Vinnie, and so her husband Nicky has placed a contract on Vinnie's life. They fly to France to find Harry and retrieve the diamonds before Rita's husband kills Vinnie (\"Rita's Confession\").\n\nOn the train to Monte Carlo, Harry meets Luigi Gaudi, a flashy Italian, who offers to be his tour guide. Harry notices that a mysterious young woman is glaring at him and diligently taking notes (\"Good to Be Alive\"). He arrives in Monte Carlo with his uncle. Although frustrated that he must fulfill many painstakingly specific tasks to gain his inheritance, he ultimately reasons that he is \"lucky\" to be there (\"Lucky\"). When he sees the young woman from the train following him, he confronts her. Her name is Annabel Glick, a representative of the Universal Dog Home of Brooklyn, and she earnestly attempts to convince Harry to donate his uncle's money to the Dog Home. Harry hates dogs, due to his scarring experiences with his landlady's vicious dogs, and flatly refuses. Annabel notes that Harry must finish every task required by the will and that she is recording his every move to make sure that he executes flawlessly all of the conditions. Harry knows that if he makes one mistake, she will take charge of his uncle, finish the trip, and claim the estate. Harry vows to persevere (\"Dogs vs. You\").\n\nVinnie and Rita arrive in Nice, France . While Rita telephones hotels in Monte Carlo to find where Harry is staying, Vinnie telephones his wife. Vinnie informs her that he will not be home for dinner because he has been forced to travel to Monte Carlo to save his life; she angrily hangs up (\"The Phone Call\"). Rita finds Harry's hotel and books two rooms down the hall from his. Meanwhile, Harry and his uncle, doggedly pursued by Annabel, spend the day traveling around Monte Carlo doing what is required in the will, buying new clothes, gambling, visiting museums, skydiving, fishing and scuba diving (\"A Day Around Town (Dance)\").\n\nThat night Harry, Annabel and Luigi go to a glamorous nightclub where the glitzy Emcee declares Monte Carlo a place for \"lovers in love\". He mistakes Harry and Annabel for a couple on their honeymoon (\"Monte Carlo!\"). The Emcee then introduces the voluptuous singer and dancer Dominique du Monaco to the crowd. She sings a flamboyant cabaret number and has everybody in the nightclub bumping (\"Speaking French\"). After her performance Dominique speaks to Harry and tells him that his uncle has arranged for the two them to spend many hours together that night. Dominique sits next to Harry and teaches him a continental toast. Annabel, thoroughly out of her element in the nightclub, recalls the comfort that only a dog can bring (\"Times Like This\"). Dominique exits the nightclub with Harry; Annabel follows. The Emcee lauds the romantic merits of Monte Carlo (\"Monte Carlo!\" (reprise)).\n\nWhile Harry is having fun in the casino, Rita, now disguised as a maid, searches Harry's hotel room for the diamonds. Vinnie is nervous and soon leaves. Harry returns to the hotel room with Uncle Anthony; Rita hides in the closet. Harry leaves the corpse in the room and returns to the casino to continue gambling, closely followed by Annabel. Rita, squinting from the closet, can barely make out the shape of the man in the wheelchair. She steps out to face who she believes to be her still-living lover, Tony. After begging his forgiveness and declaring her continued love for him, she kisses his cold hand and discovers that he is dead (\"Fancy Meeting You Here\"). Harry is on a winning streak at the casino due to Tony's friend's infallible system for winning at roulette. Rita, now livid, arrives at the casino armed with a gun and Tony's corpse. She threatens to kill Harry unless he hands over the diamonds (\"Act I Finale: Good to Be Alive\").\n\nThe cast as a Greek Chorus briefly reminds the audience of where they left off (\"Something Funny's Going On\" (reprise))\n\nAnnabel and Harry, with Uncle Anthony in tow, escape from Rita. In the ensuing fracas, Rita's gun accidentally goes off as her brother tries to restrain her. Rita turns the crowd on Vinnie and pursues Harry. Chaos ensues as Harry and Annabel try to hide from Rita and protect Uncle Anthony. A drunken maid mistakes Uncle Anthony for a pile of laundry and wheels him away. Annabel, Harry, Rita and Vinnie then frantically attempt to locate one another, the heart-shaped box, and the missing corpse. During Vinnie's search, he encounters the shapely Dominique du Monaco. She is most interested in his search for the diamonds (\"Him, Them, It, Her\").\n\nUnable to locate Uncle Anthony, Annabel and Harry return to Harry's room. Several people attempt to earn a cash reward by bringing people in wheelchairs into the room. None is Uncle Anthony. Giving up the search, Harry and Annabel open a bottle of Anthony's Dom Perignon and let down their guard. Annabel makes a toast to Harry and herself, saying that it was \"nice\" suffering through the week with him. Their relationship mellows as they finish the bottle (\"Nice\").\n\nThat night in bed, Harry has a terrible nightmare. Everyone is half dog and half human ... his landlady maliciously welcomes him back to his depressing life as a shoe salesman ... Rita threatens him with a machine gun ... Luigi and Annabel taunt him for his failure to fulfill the terms of the will. Harry's dead uncle gets out of his wheelchair and tap dances while everyone else forms a ghastly kickline (\"Welcome Back, Mr. Witherspoon\"). Harry wakes up horrified to find Annabel in bed next to him. They are both shocked to find themselves together in a state of undress. Miraculously, the drunken maid enters the bedroom with Uncle Anthony. Harry and Annabel exchange a quick moment of joy before becoming embarrassed again. Annabel, now antagonistic towards Harry, goes to the bathroom to get dressed, and Harry mulls over the situation (\"A Woman in My Bathroom\").\n\nAs Annabel is about to leave, Rita bursts into the room, gun in hand. She is now wearing her glasses and realizes that the corpse is not her lover Tony, but a dead stranger; she then demands the heart-shaped box from Harry and Annabel. They refuse to give in to her demands. With nowhere to hide, Harry and Annabel huddle together in fear, expecting to be shot dead (\"Nice\" (reprise)). Luigi Gaudi enters the room and proclaims that he is the real Uncle Anthony. He explains that his best friend (the dead man in the chair and the real Luigi Gaudi) was murdered by Rita and that he sent Harry to Monte Carlo in order to give his dead friend one last chance to experience Monte Carlo, in accordance with Luigi's dying wishes (\"Confession #2\" (reprise)). Anthony reveals that the six million dollars in diamonds is actually sewn inside the corpse. The heart-shaped box contains only the heart of the dead Luigi.\n\nVinnie and Dominique du Monaco burst into the room dressed as maids. Brandishing a gun at everyone, Vinnie tells the group that he plans to start a new life in Europe with Dominique. He demands the diamonds. Rita gladly hands him the heart-shaped box; Vinnie and Dominique exit. Tony gives Annabel Luigi's life savings in the form of a $10,000 cheque made out to the Universal Dog Home of Brooklyn. Tony gives Harry $500 and reminds him that he still has the rest of the week in Monte Carlo; he says the week is prepaid and that Harry has Luigi's infallible roulette system at his disposal. Rita points the gun at Harry and Annabel and backs them into a closet. Rita apologizes to Tony for everything, and Tony forgives her (at gunpoint). Rita and Anthony take the diamond-laden corpse and depart (\"Fancy Meeting You Here\" (reprise)).\n\nHarry and Annabel are left alone with each other. Harry locks the door of the hotel room to protect them from any more unwelcome intruders and persuades her to stay with him in Monte Carlo. Harry and Annabel kiss (\"Act II Finale: Good to Be Alive\").",

He\u2019s buzzed. She\u2019s first bemused, then game. Part of what drives their click (\u201cThe Story of the Atlantic Cable\u201d) is that Joe introduces Kirsten to alcohol. A farm girl from a chilly upbringing intrigued by her new life in the city, she takes to drink immediately (\u201cThere Go I\u201d) and she and Joe connect exuberantly through it (\u201cEvanesce\u201d). They marry. And during her pregnancy and the early months with their daughter, Lila, Kirsten is happy and sober (\u201cSammen i Himmelin\u201d). Kirsten only abstains briefly, though, before joining Joe in the bottle (\u201cAs the Water Loves the Stone\u201d).\n\nJoe\u2019s drinking gets him demoted to an account in Houston, away from his family. Both keep drinking alone, nevertheless (\u201cAre You Blue?\u201d), and one night Kirsten, taking care of Lila alone (\u201cUnderdeath\u201d), passes out with a lit cigarette and nearly burns down their apartment building. Joe and Kirsten quit drinking and move in with Kirsten\u2019s austere father on the farm where she had grown up, relieved to be healthy again (\u201cFirst Breath\u201d). But Joe has smuggled in alcohol, with a spare bottle hidden in Arneson\u2019s greenhouse, ending up in a drunk ward (\u201c435\u201d).\n\nThey now move back to the city, and Joe begins working with Jim Hungerford, his sponsor in Alcoholics Anonymous (\u201cForgiveness\u201d). But that night on her father\u2019s farm, Kirsten had also begun to drink again, and her morning-after take on the matter is different from Joe\u2019s. The only happiness she has known are the early years of their marriage, which included drinking. Joe\u2019s association with A. A. feels like a shaming (\u201cMorton Salt Girl\u201d). She leaves on an open-ended bender, hoping but struggling to rejoin being a mother to Lila, as Lila hopes for her mother\u2019s return (\u201cThe Letters\u201d). Kirsten manages to put together five days without alcohol (\u201cForgiveness (Reprise)\u201d). Joe and Lila nurse a wan hope that Kirsten will eventually rejoin them (\u201cLila Hangs the Moon\u201d), but the best Kirsten can do is stop by briefly to leave Lila a present (\u201cThere Go I (Reprise)\u201d). \u201cThe world looks so dirty to me when I\u2019m not drinking,\u201d she pleads \u2013 and with this ends the story of Kirsten and Joe.",

        "synopsis": "The play begins with the Fronde against Cardinal Mazarin . Young Louis is the consecrated King at Reims, but his power has been confiscated by his mother, Anne of Austria , and the Cardinal, as both doubt his ability to rule France alone.\n\nLouis falls in love with Marie Mancini , an Italian emigrant without noble birth, niece of Cardinal Mazarin. To prove himself as a man, the young monarch decides to join the war at the head of his armies despite Marie's attempt to stop him due to her bad premonition. Louis falls in battle, victim to a serious disease, and is believed dead for a long time. The court forgets him and attempts to name his brother Philippe the new King of France. Marie, however, refuses to accept his fate and spends many nights by his bedside praying in tears.\n\nThen, in a sudden turn of events, one of the royal doctors administers a drug that awakens Louis from his sleep. He learns that he has been forgotten by everyone in the country except Marie and his own family. Now desperately in love with the beautiful Italian, Louis proposes to her. Marie reminds him that it is impossible for a French king to marry an Italian of low birth. Anne of Austria, Mazarin and even the Pope would object.\n\nLouis stubbornly dismisses all opposition, declaring that he is King and will therefore decide his own future. Nevertheless, Anne of Austria and Mazarin put an end to the dream by exiling Marie and persuading the young King to marry the Spanish princess . The first act ends with the pain of separation.\n\nThe second Act begins with the death of Mazarin, upon which Louis seizes power and becomes the Sun King.  He becomes a d\u00e9bauch\u00e9 dallying with various women and forgetting that his people will pay heavy taxes for the construction of his dream palace, the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles .\n\nAfter many events such as the matter of the Man in the Iron Mask and the Poison Affair , Louis attains what he could not achieve with Marie Mancini. He marries, despite opposition, Fran\u00e7oise d'Aubign\u00e9, Marquise de Maintenon , a woman without noble birth who was the governess of his illegitimate children with Fran\u00e7oise-Ath\u00e9na\u00efs, marquise de Montespan .\n\nThe final performances of this play were on 6\u20138 July 2007 in Paris.",

        "description": "Flower Drum Song was the eighth musical by the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein . It is based on the 1957 novel, The Flower Drum Song , by Chinese-American author C. Y. Lee . It premiered on Broadway in 1958 and was then performed in the West End and on tour. It was adapted for a 1961 musical film .\n\nAfter their extraordinary early successes, beginning with Oklahoma! in 1943, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II had written two musicals in the 1950s that did not do well and sought a new hit to revive their fortunes. Lee's novel focuses on a father, Wang Chi-yang, a wealthy refugee from China, who clings to traditional values in San Francisco 's Chinatown . Rodgers and Hammerstein shifted the focus of the musical to his son, Wang Ta, who is torn between his Chinese roots and assimilation into American culture. The team hired Gene Kelly to make his debut as a stage director with the musical and scoured the country for a suitable Asian \u2013 or at least, plausibly Asian-looking \u2013 cast. The musical, more light-hearted than Lee's novel, was profitable on Broadway and was followed by a national tour.\n\nAfter the release of the 1961 film version, the musical was rarely produced, as it presented casting issues and fears that Asian-Americans would take offense at how they are portrayed. When it was put on the stage, lines and songs that might be offensive were often cut. The piece did not return to Broadway until 2002, when a version with a plot by playwright David Henry Hwang (but retaining most of the original songs) was presented after a successful Los Angeles run. Hwang's story retains the Chinatown setting and the inter-generational and immigrant themes, and emphasizes the romantic relationships. It received mostly poor reviews in New York and closed after six months but had a short tour and has since been produced regionally .",

Shipp as a satire on the American Colonization Society 's back-to-Africa movement of the earlier nineteenth century.\n\nIn Dahomey is regarded as a marquee turning point for African-American representation in vaudeville theater. It opened on February 18, 1903, at the New York Theatre , starring George Walker and Bert Williams , two iconic figures of vaudeville entertainment at the time.

To his surprise, Pinkerton learns that Homestead is rich, and arranges to become his trustee to gain access to Homestead's wealth. Once having been successful with that, Pinkerton struts around, acting as a dandy , or a refined figure in black society. Upon realizing Pinkerton's schemes, Homestead refuses to continue to support Pinkerton's acts, and the show culminates with a spectacular cakewalk .\n\nIn other sources, In Dahomey is described as following the attempts of two con men (played by Bert Williams and George Walker) charged with recovering a lost heirloom to be flipped for profit. The search for the heirloom crosses paths with a colonization society that intends to settle pioneers in Dahomey. The plot of the original source-text differs, according to many sources, but all agree there were three primary locales in In Dahomey : Boston , Gatorville (Florida), and Dahomey.\n\nA February 1903 New York Theatre program has been found that printed a synopsis that generally concurs with the scenes depicted in extant scripts.

Priestley .\n\nConsidered by many to be British music hall star Gracie Fields' finest vehicle, this film was written for her by leading novelist J. B. Priestley. In this morale-boosting depression movie, set in the industrial north of England, Fields stars as a resourceful, determined working class heroine, laid off from her job in a clothing mill, who has to seek work in the seaside resort of Blackpool . This gives her the opportunity both to fall into many misadventures and, of course, to sing.\n\nThe decision to film on location brings the film a life and immediacy all too absent from most films of the period. The film provides us with a snapshot of life in a seaside resort in the 1930s. The final scene of the millworkers returning to the re-opened mill while Fields leads them in the rousing title song has become an almost iconic film clich\u00e9.",

It is loosely based on the 1995 novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire , which itself was based on the 1900 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum and its 1939 film adaptation . Set in the Land of Oz before and after Dorothy Gale 's arrival from Kansas, the musical explores the complex relationship between Elphaba Thropp and Glinda Upland \u2014 the future Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda the Good \u2014 as they are tested by their contrasting perspectives, shared love interest, and reactions to the Wizard 's corrupt rule, culminating in Elphaba's tragic fall.\n\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions with producers Marc Platt , Jon B. Platt and David Stone , director Joe Mantello and choreographer Wayne Cilento , the original production of Wicked premiered on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's Curran Theatre in May and June of that year.

The second part, Wicked: For Good , was released on November 21, 2025.",
        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nThe citizens of Oz are celebrating the death of the Wicked Witch of the West . Glinda the Good Witch appears and reminisces about their past, beginning with the troubled childhood of the Witch (born Elphaba Thropp ) after her mother had an affair and her father, the Governor of Munchkinland , disowned her when she was born with green skin (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\").\n\nFlashing back many years earlier, Elphaba arrives at Shiz University with her younger paraplegic sister Nessarose, where she is ostracized for her green skin and sarcastic personality (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). The school's headmistress, Madame Morrible, assigns Elphaba to room with the popular Galinda Upland. Recognizing Elphaba's magical potential, Morrible decides to privately tutor Elphaba in sorcery (\" The Wizard and I \"), making Galinda intensely jealous. The two girls soon come to loathe each other (\"What Is This Feeling?\"). Meanwhile, Dr. Dillamond, the only animal professor at Shiz, informs Elphaba of a conspiracy to stop all animals from speaking (\"Something Bad\").\n\nA roguish prince, Fiyero, begins attending Shiz and arranges a party for his fellow students. Galinda becomes immediately enamored with him, and convinces her admirer, the Munchkin Boq, to take Nessarose to the party instead so that she can go with Fiyero. At Nessarose's urging, Elphaba asks Morrible to begin teaching Galinda sorcery. When Elphaba is mocked at the party for wearing an ugly hat Galinda gave her as a practical joke, Galinda has a change of heart and decides to dance with Elphaba (\"Dancing Through Life\"). In their room, the girls finally bond and Galinda gives Elphaba a makeover (\" Popular \"). The next day, Dillamond tells the class he has been dismissed. His human replacement showcases a cage, a new invention in Oz designed to stop animals from speaking. Elphaba, furious, frees the lion cub imprisoned within it and escapes with Fiyero. They share a private moment, but Elphaba laments that Fiyero has chosen Galinda (\"I'm Not That Girl\").\n\nMorrible tells Elphaba that the Wizard of Oz wants to meet her, and she goes with Galinda, who changes her name to Glinda in honor of Dillamond (who mispronounced her name as such), to the Emerald City (\"One Short Day\"). The two meet the Wizard and are surprised to discover his mortal nature (\"A Sentimental Man\"). Morrible appears and announces she is the Wizard's new press secretary. After being tricked into enchanting the Wizard's monkey servants to painfully sprout wings , Elphaba deduces that the Wizard is behind the suppression of animals and is a fraud who uses parlor tricks and lies to stay in power. Elphaba flees his chambers, declaring against Glinda's wishes that she must do what is right. Though empathetic, Glinda refuses to leave with Elphaba, and the two friends bid farewell before Elphaba enchants a broom to fly away from the Emerald City, vowing to fight the Wizard with all of her power (\" Defying Gravity \").\n\n### Act Two\n\nYears later, Elphaba has become known as the Wicked Witch of the West for her opposition to the Wizard's regime, while Glinda has been positioned by Madame Morrible as the Wizard's spokesperson. Fiyero, now Captain of the Wizard's Guard and unwitting fiance to Glinda, hopes to find Elphaba (\"Thank Goodness\").\n\nElphaba visits Nessarose, who is now the governor of Munchkinland following their father's death and has removed the Munchkins' few rights to prevent Boq from leaving her. Feeling guilty, Elphaba enchants Nessa's silver shoes to allow her to walk, but Boq takes this as proof that Nessarose no longer needs him and attempts to leave her for Glinda. An infuriated Nessarose attempts to cast a love spell on him, but pronounces the incantation wrong and shrinks his heart instead. Elphaba tries to save him, but can only transform him into a tin man who does not need a heart to live (\"The Wicked Witch of the East\"). Boq flees as Nessarose blames Elphaba.\n\nElphaba returns to the Emerald City to free the Wizard's monkey servants, but the Wizard discovers her. He once again tries to convince Elphaba to work with him, explaining he is an ordinary man who became revered by the citizens of Oz (\"Wonderful\"), and voluntarily frees the monkeys. Elphaba is won over until she discovers a caged Dillamond, who has lost the ability to speak, and vows to continue her fight against the Wizard. Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and decides to leave with her. Glinda is heartbroken and privately laments that Fiyero always loved Elphaba (\"I'm Not That Girl (Reprise)\"). Glinda convinces the Wizard and Morrible of a way to lure Elphaba out of hiding: by spreading a rumor that Nessarose is in danger. Unbeknownst to Glinda, Morrible and the Wizard decide a mere rumor would not fool Elphaba, and Morrible proposes \"a change in the weather.\"\n\nHidden in the forest, Elphaba and Fiyero confess their love for each other (\" As Long as You're Mine \"), but their moment is shattered when Elphaba senses that Nessarose is in danger. Her premonition is correct; a house has fallen from a tornado and crushed her sister to death. Elphaba is distraught and furious that Glinda has given Nessarose's enchanted shoes to the house's occupant, Dorothy Gale , and the two get into a physical fight that the Wizard's guards eventually break up. Fiyero arrives and allows Elphaba to escape, but gets captured. At Kiamo Ko castle, Elphaba casts a spell to try to save Fiyero; presuming him dead, she laments that she will never be seen as good and finally embraces her reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West (\" No Good Deed \").\n\nAs the Citizens of Oz declare war on Elphaba (\"March of the Witch Hunters\"), Glinda realizes that Morrible summoned the tornado that killed Nessarose and is horrified, but Morrible reminds her that she has been complicit in all of Morrible and the Wizard's plans to further her own goal of becoming a powerful figure in Oz. Meanwhile, Elphaba, crazed with grief, has captured Dorothy to try to obtain Nessarose's shoes. Glinda arrives to warn Elphaba of her danger. Elphaba accepts that she must surrender, and the two friends embrace for the last time before sharing a tearful goodbye (\" For Good \"). Glinda watches from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, melting her and leaving only her hat and a bottle of Green Elixir that had belonged to her mother.\n\nGlinda confronts the Wizard with the elixir, which he recognizes as his own; he was the man Elphaba's mother had an affair with, and thus her biological father. The Wizard leaves Oz at Glinda's orders, leaving her in charge, who arrests Morrible for her role in Nessarose's death. Meanwhile, Fiyero (now a Scarecrow as the result of Elphaba's spell) arrives at Kiamo Ko, where Elphaba emerges from a trap door, having faked her death. Elphaba and Fiyero depart Oz together, as Glinda informs everyone that the Wicked Witch is dead before reluctantly joining Oz in celebrating (\"Finale\").",

Rockfort dances to the tune of Sadia, an ambiguously gendered student-agitator, originally from the upper crust, who calls herself  a \"transvestite\". They meet at the Underground Caf\u00e9, under the amused gaze of Marie-Jeanne, a waitress who feels her job makes her robotic.\n\nAbove the caf\u00e9 stands the Golden Tower, a 121-floor building that serves as the headquarters for Z\u00e9ro Janvier, a real estate tycoon and billionaire. Janvier is running for the presidency of the Occident on a law and order, anti-immigration platform. He touts the construction of the \"new atomic world\" as well as the conquest of space.

When they meet, and depending on the version, Cristal either falls in love with Johnny at first sight and runs away with him, or gets kidnapped by him and later joins the cause. Sadia, having lost her hold over Johnny, leaves the Black Stars. Cristal becomes the face of the gang, using her knowledge of television to transmit pirate messages over the airwaves and rally public opinion to their cause.\n\nZiggy, having abandoned Marie-Jeanne and the underground world, DJs during Janvier's engagement party at the Naziland, a club built on top of the Golden Tower. A bitter Sadia reveals Johnny and Cristal's plan to destroy the Tower, sending Z\u00e9ro Janvier's men after them.\n\nCristal dies, of varying causes depending on the production, usually in front of Johnny (if not in his arms). Johnny's fate also varies: he usually dies but is sometimes imprisoned.\n\nA triumphant Z\u00e9ro Janvier is elected president of the Occident. However, his victory is marred by Stella Spotlight's (on- or off-stage) suicide, as well as, occasionally, the explosion of the Tower. Marie-Jeanne closes the show by lamenting the state of the world and heading off (in search of sunlight, or perhaps death).\n\nIn the original studio and stage productions, a final song was delivered by an alien character or Johnny's spirit, pleading with humanity to renounce its sterile obsession with stardom, realize its insignificance, and strive for peace.",

        "synopsis": "As the opening credits roll, a band called Flux, apparently with no singer, starts to play at a nightclub. Among the audience is a girl named Courtney Lane ( Tammin Sursok ). Interspersed with the scenes of the band playing, lead singer Nikko Alexander ( Nolan Gerard Funk ) calmly walks into the club through the back, barely making his cue for \"Don't Tell Me\". At the end of the song, he kicks over one of the amps, destroying it for effect. After the performance, the other members of Flux , upset by his carelessness, kick him out of the band; Nikko's girlfriend Amy ( Britt Irvin ), who is also in the band, dumps him. After the band members leave, Courtney frantically attempts to recruit Nikko into a show choir named \" Spectacular! ,\" of which she is leader. Though Nikko is skeptical and condescendingly rejects her offer, Courtney begs him to come to a carnival to see the choir perform and then make his decision.\n\nThe next day at the carnival, Nikko arrives in time to see the Spectacular! show choir perform \"Eye of the Tiger\". Afterward, the ever-anxious Courtney once again attempts to persuade Nikko, who is less than impressed by the group's performance and style, to join the show choir and help them win a national contest, even offering him half the group's earnings from the contest in exchange for his consent. Nikko declines to join the group, stating that he isn't interested in choir. Soon, another show choir named Ta-da performs \"Things We Do for Love\". The lead singers are Royce ( Simon Curtis ), who used to be the lead singer for Spectacular! but quit after breaking up with Courtney, and Tammi ( Victoria Justice ), Royce's new girlfriend who is a snobby and selfish girl. It is hinted she was a member of \"Spectacular!\" because of the number of times Courtney calls her a backstabber and that the letter I in her name stand for the \"ice in her veins\". Later on, Nikko meets with and performs for a famous music producer named Mr. Dickenson ( Matthew Bennett ), who informs him that he has a shot at getting a record deal if he can raise enough money for equipment for his demo, which has to be excellent. Nikko recalls Courtney's offer of half the earnings from the contest Spectacular! plans to perform in, and decides to join the choir in order to get the money to pay for his demo. When he approaches the choir Courtney remembers his mockery of their carnival performance and initially refuses to let him join, but acquiesces after Nikko demonstrates his talent by performing \"Break My Heart\" in front of the whole group, who are impressed by his vocals. When they are practicing, however, Nikko finds out that dancing for show choir is not as easy as it looks and cannot easily pick up the dance routines. Nikko, who lives with his older brother Stavros ( Christopher Jacot ), does not inform his brother that he has joined show choir or that he is attempting to get a record deal because he knows Stavros would not approve.\n\nSeveral days later the group, dressed in hideous cowboy costumes, goes to perform at the club Nikko and his old band, Flux , had performed at in the beginning of the movie. There Nikko runs into his old band members, leading to an awkward confrontation and a lot of mockery from Flux . Meanwhile, Ta-da , who are also at the club, performs their song \"Lonely Love Song\". Nikko discovers from the other Spectacular! members that Royce is Courtney's ex-boyfriend. Upon witnessing Ta-da's good performance and the snobby attitudes of Tammi and Royce, Nikko becomes determined to help Spectacular! win the upcoming competition and begins to think that the group should come up with new dance moves and new music. One day, before Courtney arrives for choir practice, Nikko encourages the other choir members to try things a different way, and performs \"Your Own Way\", persuading the others to join in, Nikko sang the beginning of the song, and ask the others to show some talents, Tajid ( Avan Jogia ) started beatboxing, then other members Janet ( Shannon Chan-Kent ), Caspian (Joel Ballard) and Robin ( Andrea Lewis ) showcase their singing talent. Though they are initially reluctant to go against Courtney's wishes, the rest of the group eventually agree that they need a new routine in order to win the competition. They later meet up at Nikko's house, unbeknown to Courtney, and Nikko begins to teach them new dance moves, stating that if they perform the song in front of Courtney she would be impressed and may agree to change the group's style. The choir assembles at Nikko's house every night to practice while still attending practices with Courtney every afternoon.\n\nNikko learns of Spectacular! ' s tradition of gathering for a bowling night the week before a competition. Only four members, Nikko, Courtney, Caspian and Janet, show up at the bowling alley, where they discover that Tammi and Royce are already bowling in their lane. After a brief confrontation between the two groups, Nikko persuades the others to perform a song using \"Rock The World,\" a spoof of the real-life video game Rock Band . Random selection chooses a song called \"For the First Time\", which was Courtney and Royce's old duet. She and Nikko sing it, much to Royce's jealousy, and Nikko and Courtney are becoming attracted to each other. Nikko invites Courtney over to his house for a surprise, and when they get there the whole group has assembled on Nikko's rooftop, where they all perform \"Your Own Way\" for Courtney. Courtney, instead of being impressed, is upset, accusing Nikko to have betrayed her by practicing another routine behind her back, and then leaves.\n\nLater that night, Nikko goes to Courtney's house to apologize and almost has a fistfight with Royce, who has come to ask Courtney to get back together with him. Courtney rejects Royce, who tauntingly tells Nikko that Ta-Da will beat Spectacular! at the competition in the \"weirdest trash talk that [Nikko's] ever heard.\" After Royce leaves, Nikko apologizes to Courtney for taking control of the group behind her back and offers to do things her way, but Courtney admits that the group needs a change. Courtney's mother tells Nikko that he can bring some good and change to the \"Spectacular!\" group and that Courtney will know how far they are actually able to push the envelope to win. The two of them decide to combine their talents and perform a song that everyone can agree upon, and Mr. Romano ( Greg Germann ), their music teacher, suggests a song called \"Something to Believe In\". Spectacular! begins intense rehearsals and all seems well (\"Just Freak\"), until Mr. Dickinson pays Nikko and Stavros a visit and informs them that his boss is offering Nikko and Flux a record deal after an audition and will only be available on Saturday night. Knowing that Spectacular! is scheduled to perform at the concert on Saturday night, Nikko is torn between his commitment to the choir and his one shot at getting a record deal. He tries to inform Courtney of his decision to audition for the record deal, but cannot bring himself to do it. Meanwhile, Amy informs Stavros that Nikko has joined choir and Stavros confronts Nikko in front of the members of Spectacular! , insisting that Nikko drop out of choir and audition for the record deal instead. The other members of Spectacular! are upset at Nikko for bailing on them at the last minute, and Courtney feels that Nikko has betrayed her again.\n\nMr. Romano visits Nikko, who is having a tough time deciding what to do, at his house and reveals that he was once in a famous band as Joey Rome that could have been more successful if he hadn't flopped and broke his contract due to his fear of taking risks. Before leaving to go audition for the record deal, Courtney shows up. Nikko fears that she is mad at him for turning his back on \"Spectacular!\" but instead she kisses him on the cheek and wishes him luck. On concert night, Ta-Da performs \"On the Wings of a Dream\" and earns much applause and acclaim from the audience. Meanwhile, Nikko and Flux perform at their audition for the record deal, but Nikko's heart is not in it and the producers notice and tell him they are not interested; Stavros says that Nikko is just warming up, and that he is better than what he is giving out. Nikko begs them to let him show where his \"heart is.\" When it is Spectacular!' s turn to sing \"Something to Believe In\" at the national competition, Nikko, much to Courtney's surprise and delight, arrives onstage right before the chorus, belting out a long note. Flux joins him, playing background music, and Mr. Romano reprises his dream as a rock star by playing a guitar during the song.  Nikko and Courtney reconcile, and the group earns a standing ovation.\n\nTa-Da is announced as the winner of the contest and Spectacular! is disqualified because Flux were unregistered members of the act. Tammi reveals to Royce that she had only used him to win the contest and breaks up with him. Even though Spectacular! lost the contest, Nikko's amazing performance got him the record deal. After everyone leaves, Nikko and Courtney share a kiss. It ends with Spectacular! , Flux , and Mr. Romano in a studio together recording a song, suitably named \"Everything Can Change\", with Nikko and Courtney as the lead singers in the song.",

Stewart appeared in one of only three musical film roles that he played: the first was Born to Dance (1936) in which he introduced the Cole Porter standard \"Easy To Love\" and the second was Pot O' Gold (1941). The screenplay and song score are supplied by the prolific Sherman Brothers , who worked as staff songwriters for Walt Disney and wrote songs for his films such as Mary Poppins (1964).  Their song \"When You're Loved\" was nominated for an Academy Award for \" Best Original Song \" and was sung by Debby Boone . It is also the only musical film featuring Lassie.\n\nReleased in the wake of Star Wars , the film was critically panned as old-fashioned, and flopped at the box office.

        "synopsis": "The Mitchell Vineyard, in the rolling hills of Northern California , is the very blood of Clovis Mitchell, a spare and dignified grandfather and guardian to Kelly and her brother, Chris. The heart of the household, though,  is Lassie , a handsome young collie, affectionate, obedient, sensitive, and very wise. A threat is in the air one night when Jamison and his associate, Finch, appear at the winery and offer to buy the land from Clovis. They get a refusal from the old man, while Lassie growls in the background. Jamison promises to return, and does, to claim Lassie, one of a litter he says escaped during a fire. She has a tattoo mark in her right ear to prove it. Clovis has no alternative but to give up the dog, and tells his heart-broken grandchildren. Lassie has an alternative; taken by private plane to Jamison's home in Colorado Springs , fitted with a handsome green collar with gold studs, Lassie makes her escape. Chased by helicopter and kennel men through the rocks and hills of Colorado, Lassie manages to elude them and out-stare a cougar before she joins up with new friends \u2013 Gus, a down-at-heel wrestling manager and Apollo, a kindly mountain of a man and Gus's so-called star.\n\nAbout the time they are binding up Lassie's sores, giving her food and water, and moving along in their van, young Chris bolts on his first day of the school term and sets off alone in search of Lassie. With his distraught grandfather setting out to find the boy, and Kelly and her sweetheart, attorney Allan Fogerty, checking with the police, Chris takes a car conveyor in the direction of Colorado Springs. Soon after the truck takes off, a hungry and frightened Chris leaves the vehicle, buys food in a restaurant from a sympathetic waitress, then goes out to look for another truck, and finally dives into the back of a cattle truck. The restaurant waitress, hearing reports of Chris's disappearance, calls his home and tells his sister where the boy has been, but Chris is on the move again, and so is Lassie.

The show was directed by OBIE Award-winner Sarah Benson , artistic director of the Soho Rep, starred Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award winner Michael C. Hall . Producers on the musical were Jason Georgan, Patrick Milling-Smith, Brian Carmody, Allison Kunzman. It was created by Mars, Incorporated , parent company of confectionery brand Skittles , and produced by advertising agency DDB , commercial production company Smuggler, and marketing companies ICF Next and Tribal Worldwide in lieu of a Super Bowl commercial for Super Bowl LIII .\n\nThe show had a single performance at The Town Hall on 43rd Street between Broadway and 6th Avenue in New York City at 1pm on Super Bowl Sunday , February 3, 2019. Proceeds from the performance and related merchandise were donated to Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS , with additional matching funds donated by Mars .\n\nPrior to the public announcement of the musical in January 2019, the show was identified as Winter Live Industrial during auditions, a reference to industrial musicals . Two promotional videos were released: one featuring Hall appearing to discuss his participation in the show with a psychiatrist, and the other, the cast recording a version of the show's second song, \"Advertising Ruins Everything.\" The marketing team described the promotion of brand awareness in the three weeks leading up to the Super Bowl as the campaign's primary purpose; the show itself served as \"purely proof of concept \" and was not televised.",
        "synopsis": "The performance begins outside the theater before the show's formal start, with vendors outside the theater selling purportedly unauthorized knockoff Skittles Commercial: The Broadway Musical T-shirts at half the price of the T-shirts sold inside. In the theater, attendees were also allowed onstage prior to the start of the show, where Skittles were sold in a mock bodega that also served as the set for the musical's opening scene.\n\nThe musical itself lasts approximately thirty minutes and while it announced as not having an intermission has a brief break between the first and final two scenes. The first scene takes place in a New York City bodega before the Super Bowl. A clerk and a man who claims to run the store (but in fact does not) have a conversation about the Super Bowl, the ephemerality of life, and the nature of existence, stating that \"if we could live our lives backwards, everything would be an omen\". Customers enter the store to purchase items for Super Bowl Sunday and start to break into song, only to be silenced when the clerk points out the \"No Singing\" sign behind the register.\n\nMichael C. Hall enters the store, dressed in a cat costume. He explains that it's for performing that afternoon in a Broadway musical for Skittles, but when asked what the performance is about, he says that he does not know or understand who would pay to be there. Mysterious lights start flashing and all the actors freeze except for the clerk, who pleads for unseen individuals not to ruin his store. The lights disappear, and Hall sings the shows first song, \"This Might Have Been a Bad Idea,\" which begins with Hall fearing that performing in a Skittles ad will destroy his career. However, after he eats some Skittles, he decides that the musical will be a big success, though the bodega chorus continues to express doubts.\n\nThe show then segues to its next scene, in which actors (and at least one company representative) in the audience question Hall about the performance thus far. The sequence riffs on the name of theater, The Town Hall, by creating an actual town hall with people asking long multi-part questions, criticizing the show's content, complaining about the theater's acoustics, and calling for a creation of a national high-speed rail system. Hall quits in frustration, the curtain falls, and an announcer explains that the show has to end early.\n\nThe next scene takes place on a set after the show on a set modeled after the outside of The Town Hall theater, complete with the show's actual posters and a vendor selling the fake knockoff T-shirts. In the song \"Advertising Ruins Everything,\" audience members leaving the show complain about the show and blame both Hall and Skittles for betraying them. Hall defends advertising, but after the audience members explain how advertising has ruined various aspects of their lives, he vows never to perform in another ad so long as he can act. However, he once again starts praising Skittles, \"the perfect treat for this anti-capitalist uprising\" and informs the crowd that they themselves are merely actors in a Skittles commercial, which sparks a riot. The angry crowd tears down the curtain, which opens into a rearranged alternate universe version of the bodega. Skittles rain down from a broken ventilation shaft as the crowd trashes the bodega, but they flee when they discover that Michael C. Hall has been killed by an overturned ATM. A bear crawls across the stage.\n\nIn the final scene, Hall's ghost, wearing chains, meets the spirits of \"quote machine\" Winston Churchill and Amelia Earhart. In the final song, \"This Definitely Was a Bad Idea,\" audience members complain about the time and money wasted on the play, an advertising executive laments the show's failure to achieve marketing goals, and an exasperated Hall laments being killed. However, a news report reveals that nearly 600 packs of Skittles were sold at the show, leading everyone except Hall to conclude that Hall's death now has meaning and the show was a success.

There, Grandpa Bower, a staunch Democrat , causes trouble with his pro-Cleveland sentiments.

        "description": "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a 1971 American musical fantasy film directed by Mel Stuart from a screenplay by Roald Dahl , based on his 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . It stars Gene Wilder as chocolatier Willy Wonka . The film tells the story of a poor child named Charlie Bucket ( Peter Ostrum ) who, upon finding a Golden Ticket in a chocolate bar, wins the chance to visit Willy Wonka's chocolate factory along with four other children from around the world.\n\nFilming took place in Munich from August to November 1970. Dahl was credited with writing the film's screenplay; however, David Seltzer was brought in to do an uncredited rewrite. Against Dahl's wishes, changes were made to the story, and other decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film. The musical numbers were written by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley while Walter Scharf arranged and conducted the orchestral score.\n\nWilly Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was released in the United States on June 30, 1971, by Paramount Pictures . While the film received positive reviews from critics, it was not a major financial success, earning just $4\u00a0million by the end of its original run. It received a nomination for Best Original Score at the 44th Academy Awards and Wilder was nominated for Best Performance in a Motion Picture \u2013 Comedy or Musical at the 29th Golden Globe Awards . The film also introduced the song \" The Candy Man \", which went on to be recorded by Sammy Davis Jr. and become a popular hit. Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory has since become highly popular through television airings and home video sales. In 2014, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress , as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".",
        "synopsis": "Charlie Bucket , a 12-year-old paperboy from a poor family, passes by Willy Wonka 's chocolate factory, where a tinker tells him that nobody ever enters or exits the building. His grandfather, Joe , reveals that Wonka once shut down the factory due to espionage from rival confectioners. Though production resumed three years later, the factory remained closed to the public and the identities of the new workers remain unknown.\n\nWonka announces that he has hidden five Golden Tickets in Wonka Bars ; the finders of the tickets will receive a private tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four are found by gluttonous Augustus Gloop, who is from West Germany , followed by the spoiled Veruca Salt, who is from the United Kingdom , then by American gum-chewer Violet Beauregarde, and television-addicted Mike Teevee, also from the United States . A mysterious man is seen whispering to each child.\n\nThen, someone in Paraguay claims to have found the last ticket, but the authorities discover that it was forged. On the day before the factory tour, Charlie finds money in a gutter and uses it to purchase a Wonka Bar, which contains the fifth Golden Ticket. On his way home, he encounters the man who spoke to the other winners. Introducing himself as Arthur Slugworth, one of Wonka's rivals, the man offers Charlie a large sum of money in exchange for a sample of Wonka's latest invention, the Everlasting Gobstopper . Arriving home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone.\n\nThe next day, Wonka greets the children at the factory gates and leads them inside, where they are made to sign a contract. Inside, they meet the Oompa-Loompas, Wonka's workforce, and receive Everlasting Gobstoppers.\n\nOne by one, each child is expelled from the tour except for Charlie: Augustus is sucked up in a pipe after falling into the Chocolate River, Violet is transfigured into a giant blueberry from chewing experimental gum, Veruca falls down a garbage chute after demanding a golden goose, and Mike shrinks after misusing the Wonkavision teleporter. At one point, Charlie and Grandpa Joe sample Fizzy Lifting Drinks, causing them to float dangerously close to a large fan, but descend safely by burping.\n\nWhen the tour is over, Wonka denies Charlie and Grandpa Joe their chocolate prize, citing their violation of the contract by consuming the Fizzy Lifting Drinks. Grandpa Joe urges Charlie to give the Gobstopper to Slugworth, but Charlie chooses to return it to Wonka instead. Wonka declares Charlie the winner of the contest and reveals that \"Slugworth\" was an impostor who was one of his employees and that the offer was a test of character. As the trio then fly over the town in the Wonkavator, a multi-directional glass elevator, Wonka explains that he created the contest to find a worthy successor and invites Charlie and his family to come and live in the factory.",

        "description": "The Yeomen of the Guard; or, The Merryman and His Maid , is a Savoy Opera , with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert . It premiered at the Savoy Theatre on 3 October 1888 and ran for 423 performances. This was the eleventh collaboration of fourteen between Gilbert and Sullivan .\n\nThe opera is set in the Tower of London during the 16th century, and is the darkest, and perhaps most emotionally engaging, of the Savoy Operas, ending with a broken-hearted main character and two very reluctant engagements, rather than the usual numerous marriages. The libretto does contain considerable humour, including a lot of pun-laden one-liners, but Gilbert's trademark satire and topsy-turvy plot complications are subdued in comparison with the other Gilbert and Sullivan operas.  The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi- Shakespearean , or early modern English , in style.\n\nCritics considered the score to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, which is in sonata form , rather than being written as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of the other Gilbert and Sullivan overtures. This was the first Savoy Opera to use Sullivan's larger orchestra, including a second bassoon and third trombone. Most of Sullivan's subsequent operas, including those not composed with Gilbert as librettist, use this larger orchestra.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nPhoebe Meryll sits at the spinning wheel, sighing about the pain of love.  Wilfred Shadbolt \u2013 the head jailer and assistant torturer at the Tower of London \u2013 arrives, and Phoebe mocks him, disgusted by his profession. Wilfred, who is in love with Phoebe, has noticed her interest in one of the prisoners at the Tower, Colonel Fairfax. He gleefully conveys the news that Fairfax is to be beheaded, for the crime of sorcery, that very day.  Phoebe replies that Fairfax is merely a scientist and alchemist, and also handsome, and leaves Wilfred to suffer from his love for her.  The citizens and Yeomen arrive, singing of the Yeomen's bravery and valiant deeds. Dame Carruthers, the housekeeper of the Tower, dismisses protestations by Phoebe of Fairfax's innocence and, vexed by Phoebe's criticism of the Tower, sings its praises. After everyone leaves, Phoebe is joined by her father, Sergeant Meryll, who reports that her brother Leonard has been appointed a Yeoman for his valour in battle.  Leonard is on his way from Windsor, where the court sits, and may bring with him a reprieve for the Colonel.  Leonard Meryll enters bearing a dispatch for the Lieutenant of the Tower but no reprieve.  Sergeant Meryll is eager to save Fairfax, for the Colonel served with him in battle and twice saved Sergeant Meryll's life.  He hatches a plan: Leonard will hide away and Fairfax, sprung from his cell, will assume Leonard's guise.  Phoebe is charged with getting the key to Fairfax's cell from the lovesick jailer, Wilfred.\n\nFairfax enters under guard by an escort of Yeomen. Sir Richard Cholmondeley, the Lieutenant of the Tower, sees him and greets him sadly, as they are old friends. Fairfax bears his impending execution bravely and philosophically, prompting tears from Phoebe and even Sergeant Meryll. Fairfax asks a boon of the Lieutenant: the charge of sorcery was the doing of his wicked cousin Sir Clarence Poltwhistle, a Secretary of State, who will inherit his estate if he dies unmarried.  He therefore wishes to be married by his confessor to any available woman, it matters not whom, who will receive a hundred crowns for her hour of matrimony. The Lieutenant agrees and leaves.\n\nJack Point, a jester, and Elsie Maynard, a young singer, are pursued by a rowdy crowd that demands merriment and threatens the two strolling players.  Elsie, objecting to a man's rude attentions, boxes his ears, which gives Point a moment to quieten and amuse the crowd. The two entertainers offer to perform the song of The Merryman and his Maid : it tells of a lovelorn merryman who is jilted by a maiden in favour of an arrogant lord, but the latter rejects her, and she returns on her knees to the merryman to beg for his love, and all ends happily.  The song over, the crowd grows unruly again, and violence is averted only by the Lieutenant's arrival. Point and Elsie introduce themselves and explain that Elsie's mother Bridget is very ill and they seek money to buy medicine for her. The Lieutenant offers Elsie a chance to earn a hundred crowns (a very substantial sum) by marrying a condemned gentleman immediately.  Point, who intends to marry Elsie someday, is assured that the groom will be beheaded directly after the ceremony. Elsie consents and is blindfolded and led off by Wilfred for the secret ceremony. The Lieutenant tells Point that he has a vacancy for a jester, and Point tells him of his skills and tries out some jokes. The Lieutenant leads Point off to discuss the employment further.\n\nWilfred leads Elsie back from her anonymous meeting with the priest and the prisoner and leaves her to reflect on her impending widowhood.  Meanwhile, Wilfred wonders what they were up to in Fairfax's cell. Phoebe arrives and seductively distracts him as she steals his keys, which she gives surreptitiously to her father, who goes to free Fairfax from his cell.  She keeps Wilfred busy until her father returns the keys, which she returns to Wilfred's belt, and leaves the confused and hopeful jailer to his fantasies of marrying her.  Meryll disguises Fairfax as his son Leonard.\n\nThe Yeomen come to greet \"Leonard\", who insists that the tales of his bravery are exaggerated.  He flounders when Phoebe greets him, not having been introduced to her, but Wilfred helpfully identifies her, telling Fairfax (with a strong dose of wishful thinking) that he, Wilfred, is betrothed to Phoebe.  He commends her to the care of her \"brother\" until the marriage.  The headsman enters, and all is ready for the execution.  Wilfred, Fairfax (still disguised as Leonard) and two Yeomen go to fetch Fairfax. The Yeomen return and Fairfax announces his own disappearance. The Lieutenant blames the jailer, Wilfred, and declares his life forfeit instead. Wilfred protests his innocence and all wonder \u2013 not all honestly \u2013 how the prisoner could have escaped. Point is distraught at the escape of Elsie's husband, and Elsie faints into Fairfax's arms, as all rush off to hunt for Fairfax.\n\n### Act II\n\nTwo days have passed, and the Yeomen continue searching in vain for the escaped prisoner. Dame Carruthers enters with her niece Kate and berates the Yeomen for letting Fairfax escape. Jack Point (now employed by the Lieutenant), sits brushing up on his jests and bitterly reflecting on his profession, when Wilfred comes by.  Point taunts the failed jailer, and Wilfred says he'd rather be a jester.  This gives Point an idea.  He reveals the secret wedding and agrees to teach the oaf the art of jesting if Wilfred will publicly swear that Wilfred shot Fairfax dead as he swam across the river to escape. Wilfred agrees to swear to this lie.\n\nMeanwhile, Fairfax, still disguised as Leonard Meryll, laments his hurried marriage to a bride he cannot identify, for her face was concealed by the blindfold.  Sergeant Meryll says that Elsie, the girl who fainted at the execution, and who has been placed in Meryll's charge, has recovered, but that her illness gave Dame Carruthers an excuse to take up quarters in his house while she nursed the girl.  He has spurned the old woman's obvious overtures for years.  Carruthers then happens by, together with her niece Kate, and notes that the latter heard Elsie talking in her sleep about her secret wedding. The other three leave Fairfax alone, pleased to find that his mystery wife is the fair Elsie.  He decides to test her loyalty by pretending to woo his own wife, still disguised as Leonard.  She rejects \"Leonard's\" overtures, as a married woman should, and he is about to reveal himself to her.\n\nJust then, a shot is heard from the wharf and everyone enters.  Wilfred, with the jester's corroboration, declares that he struggled with someone creeping about, discovered it was Colonel Fairfax, who dived into the river, and seizing an arquebus , Wilfred shot him dead. The Lieutenant orders the Yeomen to search for the body, and Wilfred is celebrated as a hero. Elsie, Fairfax, Phoebe and Point are left alone, and Point asks Elsie, as she is now free, to marry him.  Fairfax, still disguised as \"Leonard\", tells Point that he doesn't know how to woo (it is not to be done in the manner of a jester!), and he undertakes to instruct Point in this art, following this up with a most effective demonstration on Elsie.  Point, slow to see that Fairfax is wooing the girl for himself (and that Elsie has fallen for the heroic \"Leonard\"), finally protests.  Fairfax tells Point that he has shown him how to woo and that he should apply the teachings \"elsewhere\". Phoebe, seeing her adored Fairfax pledged to another, bursts into tears, while Point, shocked by the turn of events, wishes he was dead.\n\nWilfred sees Phoebe weeping and she, rendered incautious by anger and hurt, and by her scorn for the jailer, inadvertently reveals that \"Leonard\" is in fact Fairfax.  Realizing the game is up, she desperately buys Wilfred's silence by agreeing to marry him (after a long engagement). The real Leonard then returns and announces that Fairfax's reprieve has finally arrived.  Sergeant Meryll enters, followed surreptitiously by Dame Carruthers. Phoebe tells him of her folly and goes with Wilfred, whereupon Dame Carruthers reveals herself to Meryll and threatens to expose the three schemers who had freed Fairfax illegally.  He resignedly buys her silence with his offer of marriage.\n\nElsie arrives joyfully for her wedding to the man she still knows as \"Leonard\", but the Lieutenant arrives and announces that her husband Fairfax lives.  Fairfax arrives dressed for the wedding, but Elsie, distraught over the loss of \"Leonard\", does not turn to see his face.  He teases his wife, keeping up the pretence for another minute.  Elsie begs for his mercy, to free her to go to her love, \"Leonard\", but he says that his heart is like a \"massive rock\" and claims her as his bride.  Finally Elsie turns to see his face, and finally recognises him as her adored one.  All once again erupt into joy, except the broken-hearted Jack Point. Tearfully, he reprises the song that he had earlier sung with Elsie, The Merryman and his Maid , with wrenching sorrow.  Elsie \"drops a tear\" for Point, but turns back to her love.  As the chorus turns away to celebrate the marriage of Fairfax and Elsie, Point falls insensible at their feet.",

It was nominated for Best Animated Feature Film at the 82nd Golden Globe Awards .",
        "synopsis": "Three years after her adventure with the demigod Maui and the island goddess Te Fiti, Moana spends her days exploring other islands near her home island of Motunui in the hope of finding people connected to the ocean. On her return from one such voyage, Moana is given the title of tautai , or master wayfinder \u2014 Motunui's first tautai in a thousand years.\n\nIn a vision, Moana's ancestor, Tautai Vasa, reveals why none of those people are connected anymore: the malicious storm god Nalo wanted power over the mortals, so he sunk a legendary island called Motufetu, which connected all of the islands, down to the depths of the ocean. Vasa further warns that the people of Motunui will go extinct in the future if Moana cannot find a way to raise Motufetu. In response to this call from the ancestors, Moana assembles a crew of people from Motunui \u2014 craftswoman Loto, historian Moni, and grumpy elderly farmer Kele, alongside her pet pig and rooster, Pua and Heihei \u2014 to follow the path of a comet across the ocean towards Motufetu.\n\nMeanwhile, Maui is seeking Motufetu himself since he had a previous quarrel with Nalo, but he is captured by Nalo's enforcer, Matangi. Maui is reluctant to contact Moana, as he fears she may not survive if she comes to help. Moana and her crew are captured by the Kakamora, a tribe of savage coconut -like pirates that Moana previously encountered, who reveal that Nalo's actions against Motufetu had caused them to be disconnected from their home island. A Kakamora named Kotu helps the crew paralyze a gargantuan monster clam inside of which is Matangi's lair. While the crew finds Maui, Moana meets Matangi and learns that she is not happy serving Nalo. Matangi helps Moana escape and reunite with Maui and her friends, before sending them to where Nalo is.\n\nMaui warns that Nalo's realm is deadlier compared to the mortal realm and that fighting him will spell certain death for mere mortals. Nalo's monsters ambush the group, damaging their raft and washing them ashore on an isolated island. Moana begins to despair, but Maui encourages her to keep on going. With Moana revitalized, the group plans to have Maui raise Motufetu so that Moana can touch it, as that is the only way to stop Nalo. Her crew repairs her raft, but when the group ventures forth to confront Nalo, they encounter a gigantic storm.\n\nMoana, realizing that Nalo is trying to stop humans from breaking the curse, asks Maui to lift Motufetu enough for her to touch it. Maui begins to pull up Motufetu with his giant hook, but Nalo strips Maui of his demigod powers with a lightning bolt. Moana, in a moment of desperation, dives into the ocean to touch Motufetu underwater, but as she succeeds, Nalo's lightning kills her. Maui jumps in after her body, and with a magical chant, summons the spirits of Tautai Vasa and Moana's ancestors, including her grandmother Tala, who help revive her as a demigoddess, with Moana gaining a wayfinder's tattoo. Maui, also regaining his powers as a demigod, finally raises Motufetu and helps Moana reconnect the people with the ocean.\n\nThe crew returns home to Motunui, leading a flotilla of the peoples of the ocean, and a celebration is held in Moana's honor. In a mid-credits scene , Nalo plans his revenge and is about to punish Matangi for helping Moana, when the giant crab Tamatoa arrives to join his cause.",

Since its premiere, the musical has been a popular choice for regional, international, and amateur theatre performances.",
        "synopsis": "The show is a \"series of self-contained vignettes\".\n\nAs the curtain rises, each character enters and finds Snoopy atop his doghouse, and they all describe \"The World According To Snoopy\". Later, Lucy and Charlie Brown have a brief discussion of why he has chosen Snoopy for a pet (\"Snoopy's Song\"), which almost leads to Lucy getting Charlie Brown to buy a new pet. Snoopy, hoping to please his owner, decides to try to follow Charlie Brown's directions better. Meanwhile, Woodstock begins his day (\"Woodstock's Theme\"), but to his dismay, he seems to have fallen in love with a worm. Peppermint Patty has similar problems with love, wishing that she could be prettier to impress Charlie Brown (\"Hurry Up, Face\").\n\nIn school, the group hopes that the teacher will not call on them to answer a question about the famous poet Edgar Allan Poe . The girls are having trouble, while the boys are confident (\"Edgar Allan Poe\"). Linus says everything correct, with Charlie Brown saying the opposite.  On Mother's Day , Snoopy reflects on how much he misses his lost mother (\"Mother's Day\"). Meanwhile, Sally , Peppermint Patty, and Lucy have a happy discussion on what they've learned in their lives (\"I Know Now\").\n\nOn Halloween , Linus , along with a reluctant Snoopy, awaits the arrival of the Great Pumpkin in the pumpkin patch (\"The Vigil\"). To his dismay, the great pumpkin never arrives, like every year. The next morning, the group looks up at the clouds where they imagine Mount Rushmore , dragons and twenty milk-white horses (\"Clouds\"), but when asked what he sees, Charlie Brown can only sadly say, \"A horsie and a duckie .\"\n\nSnoopy enters as the Easter Beagle to hand out bright Easter eggs to everyone, except Charlie Brown. A dejected Charlie Brown, musing on the new independence of his pet, is left alone (\"Where Did That Little Dog Go?\"). Similar events progress, and Lucy, Peppermint Patty, and Sally try to sell Snoopy for less than a dime (\"Dime a Dozen\"), though Snoopy is quick to realize that he must mend his ways and wishes that he could start over (\"Daisy Hill\").\n\nLife soon goes back to normal and the gang seems to have forgotten those events. They are however, beginning to think, as Lucy says, that they live \"in the most boring place in the whole stupid world!\", all of them asking the same question, if anything good will happen. They decide to organize a party, but Snoopy isn't allowed. Snoopy decides he will have his own party and still will have a fun time (\"When Do the Good Things Start?\")\n\nThe show reopens with the whole gang thinking about how friends help each other all the time (\"Friend\"). Unfortunately, Playbeagle (a play on Playboy ) has decided not to publish Snoopy's manuscript, but Snoopy's spirits remain undaunted even amid the throes of rejection, as he begins his new story (\"The Great Writer\"). The story is only a spoof off classic movies, and is rejected by the writers.\nLater, Peppermint Patty  expresses her love for Charlie Brown (\"Poor Sweet Baby\"), but soon says that \"it'll never happen\" out of embarrassment. Sally asks Linus if he can go to the movies, but he rejects. However, Sally is still confident that one day Linus will marry her (\"Husband Material\")\n\nSally, seeing leaves fall from a tree, remarks that there is something to learn from the cycle of life (\"Don't Be Anything Less Than Everything You Can Be\"). While sitting atop his doghouse, Snoopy receives a letter delivered by Woodstock: he has become Head Beagle. Snoopy celebrates his success happily, ready for anything (\"The Big Bow-Wow\").\n\nLater, the gang begins a discussion of Christmas and innocence. Then, looking up at the starry sky, Charlie Brown remarks \"I think that there must be a tiny star out there that is my star.\" They reflect on their friendships and realize that if one person changes their world, they might as well be friends forever (\"Just One Person\"). Linus remarks to Charlie Brown, \"Well, as Lucy always says, he isn't much of a dog.\" Snoopy replies, \"But, after all, who is?\" After the show, a bow is sung with a reprise of \"Don't Be Anything Less Than Everything You Can Be\".",

They are preparing to entertain at dinner, and Madame Arcati is expected later to conduct one of her famous s\u00e9ances. After dinner Madame Arcati breezes in on her bicycle, explains the details of the forthcoming s\u00e9ance, and begins the session to communicate with a spirit in the unknown. The spirit is Charles\u2019 late wife, Elvira, whose voice is audible only to Charles. Unexpectedly, Elvira, clad in a greenish cloud-like garment, flies across the room, unseen by the guests. Charles sees Elvira and has a lengthy conversation with her. He even tries to introduce her to Ruth, who is upset, thinking her husband has gone slightly daffy. Ruth storms out of the room, leaving Charles with Elvira.\nThe next morning at breakfast, Ruth feels that Charles\u2019 unusual behavior was due to the effects of alcohol, but when Elvira shoves a bowl of flowers in her face, Ruth believes. Ruth goes to Madame Arcati\u2019s coffee shop, where she is surrounded by her student spiritualists, to plead with her to get rid of Elvira. Madame Arcati has bungled the job; she doesn\u2019t know how to do it. While Ruth and Madame Arcati are having their difficulties, Charles and Elvira reminisce about their marriage. Charles agrees to take Elvira to the Penthouse Club for old times\u2019 sake. She tries to convince Charles to forget everything and follow her, as she describes her astral activities. Excited about the wonderful things that Elvira describes, and encouraged by her, he mounts the parapet, extends his arms in an attempt to fly, and plunges out of sight.\n\n### Act 2\n\nRuth points out to Charles, who as a result of his plunge has a bandaged head, that Elvira is attempting to kill him off. Elvira tampers with Charles\u2019 car, hoping to kill him when he drives it. Instead Ruth drives it first and is killed. Elvira declares her spiritual return a flop because she hasn\u2019t been successful in bringing Charles to her world. She confesses homesickness and sings about the extraordinary environment of her \"Home Sweet Heaven.\" Charles and Elvira arrive at Madame Arcati\u2019s coffee shop to try to send Elvira back home. To Madame Arcati\u2019s delight, Charles\u2019 consternation and Elvira\u2019s disgust, Ruth suddenly appears, fully materialized. Ruth bemoans the fact that she will have to spend eternity alone with Elvira. By mystical machinations, Elvira places an \"extremely long distance call\" to Merlin the Magician, somewhere in the great beyond. Merlin immediately dispenses a deadly poison, \"instant\" hemlock, which is poured into the brandy decanter. Charles and his two ectoplasmic wives try to make the best of an impossible situation. Madame Arcati attempts to untangle the mess. She discovers that Edith, the maid, unknown even to herself, is a natural medium. She dematerializes the two ghostly wives. As the dematerialized spirits romp around the house, playing havoc with the furnishings, Charles and Madame Arcati drink a toast to their success. The poisoned brandy acts quickly with Charles and Madame Arcati joining Elvira and Ruth in the celestial world of the unknown, where they will all fly faster than sound forever.",

The original 1947 Broadway production ran for 725 performances, while a film version was released in 1968 and several revivals have followed.\n\nAn elderly Irishman, Finian McLonergan, moves to the southern United States with his daughter Sharon, to bury a stolen pot of gold near Fort Knox , in the mistaken belief that it will make him prosperous, as he imagines that the gold which he thinks has been buried at Fort Knox has made America prosperous. Og, a leprechaun , follows them, desperate to recover his treasure before the loss of it turns him permanently human. Complications arise when a bigoted and corrupt U.S. senator gets involved, and when wishes are made inadvertently over the hidden crock. The Irish -tinged music score includes gospel and R&B influences.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe play opens in Rainbow Valley, Missitucky (a fictitious blend of Mississippi and Kentucky ), near Fort Knox , home of a mixture of Black and White tobacco sharecroppers . The local sheriff and Buzz Collins, front man for local senator Billboard Rawkins, demand the locals pay their taxes or else have their land auctioned off. The sharecroppers want to wait for Woody Mahoney, their union leader. Woody's mute sister Susan the Silent communicates through dancing that Woody will bring the money, while a boy named Henry translates her dance for Collins and the sheriff. The sheriff begins the auction, but the sharecroppers refuse to listen and drag him and Collins off to meet Woody (\"This Time of Year\").\nAs they leave, an elderly Irishman called Finian McLonergan arrives with his daughter Sharon. They have come looking for Rainbow Valley, but Sharon misses their home in Ireland (\" How Are Things in Glocca Morra \"). Finian explains to Sharon that American millionaires convert their wealth into gold and bury it near Fort Knox. He concludes it is the soil in and around Fort Knox that makes the US rich, and reveals that he has a crock of gold stolen from a leprechaun, which he intends to bury. Woody and the sharecroppers reenter, and when Woody doesn't have enough money to pay the interest on the taxes, Finian pays the rest. Finian and Sharon are welcomed by the sharecroppers. Sharon explains her father's philosophy of following one's dream (\"Look to the Rainbow\").\n\nThat night, Finian buries the gold and marks the spot, only to be met by Og, the leprechaun he stole from. Without his gold, Og is slowly becoming mortal, and needs it back. Sharon and Woody come looking for Finian, but are soon distracted by the moonlight and each other (\" Old Devil Moon \").\n\nSenator Rawkins is buying up land to fight progressive developers. He is not upset with losing Rainbow Valley until two geologists arrive to tell him gold has been detected in it. He vows to drive Finian and the sharecroppers off.\n\nThe next morning, Og meets Sharon and shyly confesses his feelings for her (\"Something Sort of Grandish\"). Sharon is in love with Woody, however, and Finian slyly prevents Woody from leaving for New York by making him suspect that another man is pursuing Sharon. The sharecroppers celebrate the unofficial betrothal of Sharon and Woody (\" If This Isn't Love \"). Og arrives and tells Finian he loves Sharon. He also warns Finian not to make wishes near the gold - after three wishes, the gold will vanish forever. Og enlists the local children to help find his gold, promising to get them anything from a magical catalogue (\"Something Sort of Grandish [Reprise]\").\n\nAs the sharecroppers sort the tobacco leaves, Maude, one of their leaders, explains the general unfairness of life to them (\"Necessity\"). Senator Rawkins arrives informing Finian and the sharecroppers that, by living with black people, they are breaking the law and must leave.  Outraged at the Senator's bigotry, Sharon tells him 'I wish to God you were black!' while unknowingly standing over the gold. The Senator is transformed into a black man and chased off the property by the Sheriff, who is unaware of the transformation. Woody brings news to Rainbow Valley that there is gold on their land, and the Shears-Robust shipping company has offered them all a free charge account. Insisting that credit is better than wealth, Woody and Finian tell them to use their new free credit rather than dig the gold. The group celebrates \"That Great Come-and-get-it Day\".\n\n### Act II\n\nThe sharecroppers begin unpacking extravagant gifts to themselves from their new accounts. Sharon and Finian celebrate the end of class-distinction that comes with wealth (\"When the Idle Poor Become the Idle Rich\"). Shears and Robust show up wondering when the gold will be discovered that will pay for the credit. Woody and Finian explain that there is no need to dig the gold up, since the news has led to massive investment in their tobacco label. Buzz and the Sheriff, however, accuse Sharon of using witchcraft to turn the Senator black. Woody orders them off. He and Sharon agree to marry (\"Old Devil Moon [Reprise]\"). Susan the Silent watches them, and dances by herself, and discovers the hidden gold (\"Dance of the Hidden Crock\"). She takes the gold for herself and hides it.\n\nMeanwhile, the still-black Senator Rawkins is hiding in the woods. He meets Og and explains what happened to him. Og decides what the Senator needs is a new inside rather than a new outside. He uses his own magic to make the Senator a nicer person (\"Fiddle Faddle\"). In his new persona, Rawkins falls in with a group of black gospel singers looking for a fourth man (\"The Begat\"); by chance, they are all going to sing at Woody and Sharon's wedding. The wedding is interrupted by Buzz and the Sheriff, who have come to arrest her for witchcraft. The Senator tries to defend Woody and Sharon, but as a black man he lacks any authority over the Sheriff. Finian steps in, promising Sharon can change the Senator back. He dismisses everyone, intending to use the crock to undo her wish, but finds the crock gone.\n\nOg, now almost human, looks for Sharon to tell her his feelings. He finds Susan instead, but realizes he is also attracted to her. He wonders if all human love is so fickle (\"When I'm Not Near the Girl I Love\"). Finian finds them and tells them Sharon is in danger. When Og reveals he doesn't have the gold, Finian runs off in despair. Susan knows where the gold is, but can't speak. Frustrated, Og wishes she could talk, not knowing the gold is under his feet. Susan speaks, and tells him she loves him. Og realizes there is only one wish left, and if he uses it to save Sharon, he cannot be a leprechaun again. He is unsure what to do until Susan kisses him. Deciding being human isn't so bad, Og wishes the Senator white again.\n\nThe Senator promises to be a better representative to the people, and the sharecroppers welcome Og and the now-verbal Susan (\"If This Isn't Love [Reprise]\"). Finian, however, has lost the crock and his hope of getting rich. Seeing that Sharon and Og have found their dreams, he goes off again in search of his own rainbow, saying 'Maybe there's no pot of gold at the end of it, but there's a beautiful new world under it.' The cast tells him goodbye, promising to see him in Glocca Morra (\"Finale\").",

        "synopsis": "In August 1949, in the South African village of Ndotsheni (The song \"The Hills of Ixopo\" is sung at this point.), the black Anglican priest of St. Mark's Church, the Rev. Stephen Kumalo, learns from a letter from his brother (John Kumalo, who lives in Johannesburg ) that their sister is in trouble. Stephen decides to travel to Johannesburg to help his sister; he will also seek his son, Absalom, who works in the mines (\"Thousands of Miles\"). In Johannesburg, Stephen learns that his sister will not leave but she asks him to take care of her young son, Alex.\n\nHe finally locates his son Absalom, who had been in jail. Absalom now plans with his friends to steal, so they can get enough money to avoid a life in the gold mines. Absalom's pregnant girlfriend Irina tries to convince him not to take part, but he goes ahead with his plan (\"Trouble Man\"). During the robbery, Absalom kills Arthur Jarvis, a white friend of his father, Stephen. As Absalom is jailed, Stephen wonders how to tell his wife, Grace, and he realizes he is facing a crisis of faith (\"Lost in the Stars\").\n\nStephen knows that his son could either tell a lie and live or tell the truth and die. He prays for guidance (\"O Tixo, Tixo, Help Me\"). At the trial, Absalom's two friends lie to the court and are freed, but Absalom, truly repentant, tells the truth and is sentenced to hang (\"Cry, the Beloved Country\"). Stephen performs a wedding between Absalom and Irina in prison and then returns home to Ndotsheni with Irina and Alex. Alex and the child of Arthur Jarvis meet and start to become friends (\"Big Mole\"). Stephen tells his flock he can no longer be their minister, and their faith is now also shaken (\"A Bird of Passage\").\n\nOn the still-dark morning of the execution, Stephen waits alone for the clock to strike (\"Four O'Clock\"). Unexpectedly, the father of the murdered man pays him a visit. He tells Stephen that he has realized that they have both lost sons. Out of recognition of their mutual sorrow, and despite their different races, he offers his friendship, and Stephen accepts.",

        "description": "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart .\n\nInspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (254\u2013184 BC), specifically Curculio , Pseudolus , Miles Gloriosus , and Mostellaria , the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce , including puns, the slamming of doors, comedy of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\".\n\nThe musical's original 1962 Broadway run won several Tony Awards , including Best Musical and Best Author (Musical). A Funny Thing has enjoyed several Broadway and West End revivals and was made into a successful film starring the original lead of the stage musical, Zero Mostel .",
        "synopsis": "In ancient Rome, some neighbors live in three adjacent houses. In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).\n\nOne day, Senex and Domina go on a trip and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus who is nevertheless still a virgin. Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they visit Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior Captain Miles Gloriosus , who is expected to claim her very soon. Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a plague from Crete , which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the captain, for \"that is the way of a courtesan.\" To appease her, he tells her to wait (\"that's what virgins do best, isn't it?\") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague and will offer to remove the body. Hero will stow away with Philia on a ship headed for Greece. Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is a cup of mare's sweat, and Pseudolus goes to search for it.\n\nUnexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives and nervously tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-empty house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted \u2013 a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).\n\nWhen Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has \"escaped\", Lycus is terrified to face the captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, \"Lycus\", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.\n\nComplicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is \"up to something low.\" She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in drag and pretending to be Philia, \"dead\" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three \"Philia\"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia \u2013 all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus, who had been recruited as mourners at \"Philia\"'s ersatz funeral, have escaped, and Lycus sends his eunuchs out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.\n\nFinally, the captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble \u2013 but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he is her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, she is freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero with Erronius' blessing; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children.  A happy ending prevails for all \u2013 except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.",

        "synopsis": "In Maine in the early 1900s, an orphan named Pete flees from the Gogans \u2013 a horrible and abusive farm family that had previously purchased him \u2013 with the assistance of an unseen force he calls Elliott. They call for him to return and promise they will treat him better, while also intending to punish him severely. After they abandon their search, he falls asleep. The next morning, he awakens and Elliott is revealed to be a green dragon that can turn invisible.\n\nPete and Elliott visit Passamaquoddy , where the invisible Elliott's clumsiness causes Pete to be labeled a source of bad luck. Lampie, the lighthouse keeper, stumbles out of a tavern and encounters him. Elliott makes himself visible and Lampie, terrified, runs to the townspeople. They dismiss his claims as a drunken rant. In a seaside cave, Pete reprimands Elliott for causing trouble. As they make up, Lampie's daughter, Nora, appears, warning that Pete is not safe there because of the incoming tide. After realizing he is an orphan and not from the area, she offers him shelter at the lighthouse, and they bond. He learns the story of her fianc\u00e9, Paul, whose ship was lost at sea the year before, and promises to ask Elliott to try to locate him.\n\nItinerant quack Dr. Terminus and his assistant, Hoagy, win over the gullible townspeople, who are angered by their return. After Lampie takes Hoagy to the cave where Elliott resides to prove that he is real, their encounter with him goes awry and they flee. Hoagy tries to tell Dr. Terminus about Elliott, but he does not believe him. The next day, the local fishermen complain about the scarcity of fish, believing it's Pete's fault. Nora says the fishing grounds shift from time to time and Pete should be welcomed into town. That night, Nora and Lampie argue over Lampie's claims of seeing Elliott and Nora's belief that Paul will return.\n\nNora takes Pete to start school, where the teacher, Miss Taylor, unfairly punishes him for Elliott's antics. Enraged, Elliott smashes into the schoolhouse, leaving his shape in the wall and frightening the townspeople. Dr. Terminus, now convinced Elliott is real, discovers from a book that any physical property from dragons can be used for remedies and tonics, and conspires with Hoagy to exploit Elliott for medical profit. Pete accepts Nora and Lampie's invitation to live with them. When the Gogans arrive in town and demand he be returned, they brandish a document proving they had legally bought him for fifty dollars (plus fees), but Nora refuses to surrender him. As the Gogans chase them in a boat, Elliott sinks it, saving Pete. Dr. Terminus makes a deal with the Gogans to capture Pete and Elliott, even convincing the townspeople that capturing Elliott will solve their problems.\n\nThat evening, a storm blows in, while at sea, a ship approaches Passamaquoddy with Paul on board. Dr. Terminus lures Pete to the boathouse while Hoagy does the same to Elliott, who gets caught in a net, but frees himself. He retrieves Pete in a confrontation with the Gogans, who finally accept defeat and flee after he destroys their document. Dr. Terminus attempts to harpoon him, but his leg gets caught in the rope and he is sent catapulting through the ceiling, ending up dangling upside down near a utility pole. Elliott saves the Mayor, Miss Taylor, and the members of the Town Board from a falling utility pole, revealing himself to them. At the lighthouse, the lamp has been extinguished by a rogue wave . Elliott lights it with his fire, revealing himself to Nora and saving the ship.\n\nThe next morning, the Mayor and townspeople praise Elliott for his help, and Nora is reunited with Paul. He explains he was the sole survivor of a shipwreck at Cape Hatteras and suffered amnesia, but something knocked him out of bed and restored his memory. Elliott reveals to Pete that since he has a new family now and is safe at last, he must move on to help another child in trouble. Soon accepting this, Pete says goodbye to him as he and his family watch him fly away, with Pete reminding him that he is supposed to be invisible as he disappears into the sky.",

Morgan , Henry Ford , Stanford White , Harry Kendall Thaw , Admiral Peary , Matthew Henson , and Emma Goldman .",
        "synopsis": "### Act one\n\nNarration by J. P. Morgan , Henry Ford , Booker T. Washington , Emma Goldman , Harry Houdini , and Evelyn Nesbit connect three families: an upper-class White family from New Rochelle \u2013 the Little Boy (Edgar), his Father (who runs a fireworks factory), Mother, Mother's Younger Brother, and Grandfather; a Black couple from Harlem in New York City \u2013 Sarah, who adores the pianist Coalhouse Walker Jr.; and Jewish immigrants from Europe on the Lower East Side : Tateh, a Latvian artist and his young daughter (\u201cPrologue: Ragtime\u201d).\n\nAs Father leaves on Robert Peary 's 1912 expedition to the North Pole, he asks Mother to oversee his affairs and assures her that nothing will change in his absence, but Mother feels adrift without her husband to guide her (\u201cGoodbye, My Love\u201d). A \"rag ship\" arrives, carrying a hopeful Tateh and his Little Girl to America, while Mother wishes Father safe passage (\u201cJourney On\u201d). Meanwhile, Mother's Younger Brother, an intense and awkward young man yearning for purpose who works at Father's fireworks factory, attends the vaudeville act of Evelyn Nesbit , a young woman who became famous after her wealthy lover Stanford White was killed by her millionaire husband Harry K. Thaw (\u201cCrime of the Century\u201d). After her show ends, Younger Brother confesses his love to Evelyn. She kisses him, but only for the benefit of a press photographer, then cheerfully rejects him afterward.\n\nAt home in New Rochelle, Mother discovers a still-living newborn Black baby, partly buried alive in her garden. The police arrive with Sarah, the baby's mother. Pitying her, Mother takes responsibility for Sarah and her child. Brother thanks her. Surprised at herself, she remarks that her husband would never have allowed her to make such a decision (\u201cWhat Kind of Woman\u201d). At Ellis Island , the immigrants arrive (\u201cA Shtetl Iz Amereke\u201d). Tateh eagerly begins his new life, drawing silhouettes and selling them on the street. He and Little Girl quickly descend into poverty. Emma attempts to get him to join the Socialist movement, but he refuses. A wealthy man even offers to purchase Little Girl, whom Tateh now keeps on a leash for safety. Inspired by immigrant magician Harry Houdini, Tateh resolves to begin again somewhere else (\u201cSuccess\u201d). In Harlem, Coalhouse, a popular pianist, informs his audience that he's finally found his lost love, Sarah, and is going to win her back (\u201cHis Name Was Coalhouse\u201d/\u201cGettin' Ready Rag\u201d). He then purchases a Model T while Henry Ford and his workers glorify industry (\u201cHenry Ford\u201d).\n\nTateh and Little Girl leave for Boston; en route, they meet Mother and Edgar in New Rochelle and politely make conversation (\u201cNothing Like the City\u201d). At Mother's home, Sarah explains her desperate actions to her baby (\u201cYour Daddy's Son\u201d). Also en route to New Rochelle, Coalhouse is harassed by a racist fire squad led by chief Will Conklin, who taunt him for driving his own car. He arrives at Mother's house where, he has heard,  a Black woman is living. He is stunned to learn of the baby's existence, and when Sarah refuses to see him, he returns weekly (\u201cThe Courtship\u201d) until Mother invites him inside. Grandfather asks Coalhouse to play a minstrel song on the parlor piano; instead, Coalhouse plays a ragtime song. Father returns home while Coalhouse is playing, and is stunned by the changes to his family's life, while Mother and Younger Brother are proud of her choices. Eventually, Sarah reconciles with Coalhouse (\u201cNew Music\u201d). The two go on an idyllic picnic where, inspired by the words of Booker T. Washington, he dreams of a just, future America that their son will grow up in (\u201cWheels of a Dream\u201d).\n\nAt a worker's hall, Younger Brother hears Emma speak passionately about a textile mills strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts , where Tateh and his daughter are among those targeted by federal troops and strikebreakers. Younger Brother imagines that Emma is speaking directly to him (\u201cThe Night That Goldman Spoke at Union Square\u201d). Emma is arrested, prompting a riot that mirrors the chaos in Lawrence, where Tateh is beaten by a policeman. He and Little Girl escape Lawrence on a train; he gives his daughter a flip book of moving silhouettes to calm her. The train conductor offers to buy the book, and Tateh, hurriedly dubbing it a \"movie-book\", sells it for a dollar. Tateh realizes that \"movie-books\" may be a route out of poverty (\u201cGliding\u201d).\n\nReturning to New Rochelle, Coalhouse and Sarah are stopped by Conklin and the fire squad, who demand a fictitious toll; Coalhouse refuses. A lecture by Booker T. Washington on patience and dignity is juxtaposed against the white firemen's destruction of Coalhouse's new Model T (\u201cThe Trashing of the Car\u201d). Coalhouse vows legal action (\u201cJustice\u201d), postponing his marriage to Sarah until he gets justice. Sarah goes to a campaign rally nearby to ask for help from the vice-presidential candidate; as she approaches, JP Morgan shouts \"She's got a gun!\" and Sarah is beaten to death by the Secret Service (\u201cPresident\u201d). At her funeral, Black mourners demand an end to such injustice and pray for true equality. Mother, Father, Younger Brother, Tateh and Emma look on as Coalhouse weeps at Sarah's grave (\u201cTill We Reach That Day\u201d).\n\n### Act two\n\nThe Little Boy wakes up screaming from a nightmare in which Harry Houdini attempts a daring escape after being locked in a dynamite-laden box by Will Conklin (\"Harry Houdini, Master Escapist\"). This dream proves prophetic: news arrives that a volunteer firehouse has been bombed. Coalhouse has vowed to get justice on his own terms (\u201cCoalhouse's Soliloquy\u201d) and now terrorizes New Rochelle while demanding his car be restored to him and that Will Conklin be delivered to him. Booker T. Washington condemns Coalhouse's actions (\u201cCoalhouse Demands\u201d). In the chaos, Mother retains custody of Sarah and Coalhouse's baby. Father blames her for bringing this turmoil into their lives, but Younger Brother lambastes him for his blindness and storms out of the house. Mother grows increasingly offended by her husband's ignorant outlook. Father, to distract Edgar from the unrest, takes his son to a baseball game, but feels alienated from the raucous, working-class crowd, and begins to realize that his genteel way of life is passing (\u201cWhat a Game\u201d). Coalhouse's campaign continues (\u201cFire in the City\u201d), and so Father decides to temporarily move the family to Atlantic City .\n\nIn Atlantic City, Evelyn's career is on the downslide and Harry Houdini has become intrigued by the supernatural and the afterlife following the death of his mother (\u201cAtlantic City\u201d). Edgar cryptically shouts \"Warn the Duke!\" to Houdini. Mother encounters Tateh again, not recognizing him from their brief meeting months ago; now a wealthy filmmaker, he has re-invented himself as \"the Baron Ashkenazy\" and is directing a silent movie in Atlantic City (\u201cBuffalo Nickel Photoplay, Inc.\u201d). Edgar and the Little Girl soon become fast friends, prompting Mother and Tateh to become friends as well; eventually, Tateh reveals who he is, and they grow even closer (\u201cOur Children\u201d).\n\nBack in Harlem, Younger Brother seeks out Coalhouse but is repeatedly turned away until Coalhouse is convinced that he can be trusted. Coalhouse has banished music from his life but watches a carefree young couple (\"Harlem Nightclub\") and recalls meeting Sarah (\u201cSarah Brown Eyes\u201d). Younger Brother meets with him but is inarticulate and nervous: his profound thoughts, narrated to the audience by Emma, stand in contrast to the only phrase he can muster: \"I know how to blow things up.\" (\u201cHe Wanted to Say\u201d). With Younger Brother's help, Coalhouse and his men take over J.P. Morgan's magnificent library in the heart of New York City, threatening to blow it up. Father is summoned to help reason with Coalhouse. Before he goes, he assures Mother that everything will soon return to the way it was, but Mother knows such hopes are naive (\u201cBack to Before\u201d). Meeting with the police, Father devises a mediation strategy involving Booker T. Washington, whom Coalhouse allows to enter the library. Washington, invoking the violent legacy Coalhouse is leaving his son, works out a deal with Coalhouse. Younger Brother is enraged at Coalhouse's abandonment of their cause (\u201cLook What You've Done\u201d).\n\nWashington leaves and Father enters the library as a hostage. There, he finally realizes the profundity of society's troubles while seeing Coalhouse convince Younger Brother and his men that violence cannot solve injustice. Coalhouse exhorts them to fight through the power of their words (\u201cMake Them Hear You\u201d). Coalhouse's sacrifice and oratory convince Younger Brother and the men to leave while Father tells Coalhouse about his son. Coalhouse thanks Father for his kindness. Once he leaves the library, Coalhouse is shot dead by the police.\n\nEdgar appears to introduce the Epilogue. Younger Brother departs for Mexico to fight for Emiliano Zapata . Emma is arrested and deported. Booker T. Washington establishes the Tuskegee Institute , while Evelyn fades into obscurity. Harry Houdini realizes upon the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand that Edgar's shout of \"Warn the Duke!\" was a true mystical experience. Father dies aboard the RMS Lusitania ; after a year of mourning, Mother marries Tateh, adopts Coalhouse and Sarah's son, and moves to California. Tateh is struck by an idea for a film series centering on a diverse group of children banding together . The ghosts of Coalhouse and Sarah watch their son grow up (\u201cEpilogue: Ragtime/Wheels of a Dream: Reprise\u201d).",

It is based on the 1998 film of the same name . The musical revolves around Robbie, who sings at weddings, his failed relationship with his former fianc\u00e9e, and his romance with a new love, Julia.\n\nThe musical premiered on Broadway in 2006 and had several US tours starting in 2007. It was nominated for the 2006 Tony Award for Best Musical . It subsequently has had many international productions.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nRobbie Hart, a wedding singer, lives with his Grandma Rosie in Ridgefield, New Jersey . He and his band play a great wedding gig (\"It\u2019s Your Wedding Day\"). During his usual \"warm-up-the-crowd routine,\" Robbie proudly announces that he will be married to his beloved fianc\u00e9e Linda the next day. At the wedding gig, Robbie meets a waitress named Julia Sullivan, who can't wait to get married (\"Someday\"). Afterward, Robbie tries to write a sweet (eventually corny) love song to Linda, with help from Julia, whom he had just met during the previous wedding (\"Awesome\"). The following day, however, Linda dumps Robbie at the altar, with only a note claiming that she wants to be the wife of a rock star and not just a wedding singer (\"A Note from Linda\"). Meanwhile, an anxious Julia goes out to dinner with her Wall Street banker boyfriend, Glen Guglia, hoping he will pop the question, which he does (\"Pop!\").\n\nRobbie falls into a deep depression (\"Somebody Kill Me\"), but is urged by his bandmates Sammy and George, and even his grandmother (\"A Note from Grandma\"), to use that intense emotion to get back on his feet. However, the angry Robbie does nothing but enrage the guests at the next wedding gig (\"Casualty of Love\"), and he is soon thrown into the dumpster by the groom and an angry crowd of wedding guests. With some convincing from his friend Julia, Robbie does \"Come Out of the Dumpster,\" but changes his singing gigs strictly to bar mitzvahs (\"Today You Are a Man\"). After the Shapiro bar mitzvah (\"George\u2019s Prayer\"), Julia convinces Robbie to help her register for her wedding, as her fianc\u00e9 Glen is, as usual, busy with business-related affairs (\"Not That Kind of Thing\").\n\nWhile at the mall, Robbie and Julia meet up with Julia's cousin and best friend Holly, who convinces the \"faux duo\" that Julia needs to practice her wedding kiss. Robbie and Julia awkwardly and lovingly kiss, only to be interrupted by the reality that Julia is marrying Glen. After seeing the kiss, Holly decides that she should go out with Robbie. Julia, still shocked by the kiss, hastily agrees with Holly. Much later that night, Robbie, Holly, Julia, Glen, Sammy, and George go to a club in New York City (\"Saturday Night in the City\"). Here Robbie finally realizes that Glen is a cheater and that he, Robbie, loves Julia. Holly realizes this too and tells Robbie that Julia is marrying Glen because of his money and security. Upon hearing this, Robbie says, \"Well, I\u2018m in big trouble, then. But maybe I could change.\"\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe next morning, Robbie visits Glen at his Wall Street office to get a job and learn how to be like him in order to secretly impress Julia (\"All About the Green\"). Later, Julia and Holly recall the events of the night before and Julia begins to question if rich men are truly better people (\"Someday - Reprise\"). Sammy arrives and tries to woo Holly, but is given the cold shoulder, but Holly can't help but feel that despite his flaws, there is no other man who could replace Sammy (\"Right in Front of Your Eyes\"). Later in the evening, a \"Glenified\" Robbie finds Julia at his doorstep and tries to woo her. When that doesn't work, he accuses her of marrying Glen for his material possessions. Julia is stung and walks away from Robbie, throwing a present in his face: personalized blank sheet music. After all, Julia truly cares about Robbie and wants him to sing at weddings again, especially her own.\n\nRobbie realizes what he's done and drinks his sorrows away at a local bar (\"All About the Green - Reprise\"). Sammy and George go to the bar and try to convince Robbie that staying \"Single\" is the right thing to do. Inadvertently, Sammy and George end up persuading Robbie into going to Julia's house to tell her how he really feels. Meanwhile, at Julia's house, Julia is with her mother, Angie, trying on her wedding dress, but is having doubts about marrying Glen because of recent events with her and Robbie. Julia's mother reassures her that Glen really is \"Mr. Right\" and questions why Julia would leave him for a wedding singer. But Julia still has doubts. Robbie looks into Julia's window and sees her trying on her wedding dress and smiling at her reflection. He thinks it's because she's marrying Glen, but Julia is smiling only because she's imagining being Robbie's wife (\"If I Told You\"). Robbie comes across Glen in the middle of a bachelor party. Glen invites Robbie, but Robbie simply begs him not to cheat on Julia anymore. Glen gets defensive and condemns Robbie. Robbie gets knocked down and Glen fires him. Robbie goes home drunk and dazed only to find Linda in his bed, wanting him back (\"Let Me Come Home\"). Before she can fully apologize Robbie falls into a deep slumber.\n\nThe next day, Julia goes to Robbie's house to tell him how she really feels, only to find Linda instead. This scares Julia into eloping with Glen to Las Vegas. Meanwhile, Robbie wakes up and promptly kicks Linda (the \"psycho\") out. At Grandma Rosie's 50th anniversary party, Robbie finds out from Holly what happened to Julia. Only then do Robbie and Julia realize that they may never see each other again, and they may never get to tell each other what's on their minds (\"Not That Kind of Thing / If I Told You - Reprise\").\n\nWith urging from his grandmother and Sammy, Robbie goes to the airport and gets on the next plane to Vegas (\"Move That Thang\"). With the help of a group of Vegas impersonators ( Billy Idol , Mr. T , Ronald Reagan , Tina Turner , Cyndi Lauper , Nancy Reagan , and Imelda Marcos ), Robbie crashes Julia's and Glen's wedding at the Little White House Chapel and sings his new song to Julia (\"Grow Old With You\"). Glen is outraged that Robbie and Julia still have feelings for each other and blurts out that he cheated on Julia with \"like a hundred other women.\" Upon hearing this, the impersonators beat Glen up, and Robbie proposes to Julia. She says yes, on one condition: \"Will you sing at my wedding?\" The answer is a resounding \"Yes!\" Later, Mr. and Mrs. Robbie Hart are wed (\"Finale\").",

        "description": "Rent (stylized in all caps ) is a rock musical with music, lyrics, and book by Jonathan Larson . Loosely based on the 1896 opera La boh\u00e8me by Giacomo Puccini , Luigi Illica , and Giuseppe Giacosa , it tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists struggling to survive and create a life in Lower Manhattan 's East Village , in the thriving days of the bohemian culture of Alphabet City , under the shadow of HIV/AIDS .\n\nThe musical was first seen in 1993 in a workshop production at New York Theatre Workshop , the off-Broadway theatre which was also where the musical began performances on January 26, 1996. The show's creator, Jonathan Larson, had died suddenly of an aortic dissection the night before. The musical moved to Broadway 's larger Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1996.\n\nOn Broadway, Rent gained critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Musical . The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008, after 12 years, making it one of the longest-running shows on Broadway .

In 2005, it was adapted into a motion picture featuring six of the eight principal cast members from the 1996 stage premiere.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nOn Christmas Eve in Manhattan's East Village, two roommates\u2014Mark, a filmmaker, and Roger, a rock musician\u2014struggle to stay warm and produce their art (\"Tune Up #1\"). Mark's mother leaves him a voicemail wishing him a Merry Christmas and trying to comfort him since his ex-girlfriend Maureen dumped him (\"Voice Mail #1\"). Their friend Tom Collins, a gay anarchist professor of computer-age philosophy at New York University, calls and plans to surprise them at their apartment, but is mugged before entering. At the same time, Mark and Roger's former roommate and friend Benny, who has since become their harsh new landlord, has reneged on an earlier agreement and now demands last year's rent, before shutting down their electrical power (\"Tune Up #2\"). However, Mark and Roger stubbornly resolve against paying the rent, which they were promised would not be a problem (\"Rent\"). Meanwhile, Angel, a cross-dressing street drummer (presently out of drag), finds Collins wounded in an alley and tends to him (\"You Okay Honey?\") - the two are immediately attracted to each other, each learning that the other is HIV positive . It is revealed that Roger also has HIV, which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who died by suicide after learning of her diagnosis, causing Roger to fall into depression. Mark leaves the loft while Roger stays home (\"Tune Up #3\"), trying to compose on his guitar without success; he wishes desperately to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies (\"One Song Glory\"). Their neighbor Mimi, an exotic dancer and drug addict, arrives at their apartment asking for help with lighting her candle, flirting with Roger in the process; however, he is clearly hesitant to return her affections (\"Light My Candle\"). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents (\"Voice Mail #2\").\n\nAt last, the missing Collins enters the apartment, presenting Angel, who is now in full drag ; she amusingly shares the money she earned from killing an affluent couple's dog by loudly playing nonstop for an hour (\"Today 4 U\"). Mark comes home, and Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the homeless from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they can successfully convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves (\"You'll See\"). Mark leaves the loft again to go help Maureen with the sound equipment for the protest, unexpectedly meeting Joanne at the stage. Initially hesitant with each other, the two eventually bond over their shared distrust of Maureen's \"gaslighting\" and promiscuous behavior (\"Tango: Maureen\"). Mark then joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting (\"Life Support\"), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment (\"Out Tonight\"). Extremely upset by Mimi's intrusion, he demands that she leave him alone and resists any romantic feelings he may harbor for her (\"Another Day\"). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying an undignified death from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts (\"Will I\").\n\nCollins, Mark, and Angel protect a homeless woman from police harassment using Mark's camera, but she chastises them, believing their intent was for Mark to make a name for himself from her situation (\"On the Street\"). To lighten the mood, Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York City to open a restaurant in Santa Fe (\"Santa Fe\"). Soon, Mark leaves to check up on Roger; while alone, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other (\"I'll Cover You\"). Joanne hectically prepares for Maureen's show, trying to balance the simultaneous multiple calls (\"We're Okay\"). Before the performance, Roger apologizes to Mimi, inviting her to come to the protest and the dinner party his friends are having afterwards. At the same time, police, vendors, and homeless people prepare for the protest (\"Christmas Bells\"). Maureen performs in an avant-garde, if not over-the-top, manner, basing her piece on \" Hey Diddle Diddle \" (\"Over the Moon\"). At the post-show party at the Life Caf\u00e9, Benny arrives, criticizing the protest and the group's bohemian lifestyle while also revealing that his wife Alison's Akita, Evita, died due to Angel's actions; Mark and his group defiantly respond by celebrating their status (\" La Vie Boh\u00e8me \"). Mimi and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive and hesitantly decide to continue their relationship (\"I Should Tell You\"). At the end of the Act, Joanne explains that Mark and Roger's building has been padlocked and a riot has broken out; Roger and Mimi, unaware of the violence, share their first kiss. The celebration continues (\"La Vie Boh\u00e8me B\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe cast lines up to sing together before the plot of the second act begins, affirming that one should measure life \"in love\" (\" Seasons of Love \"). On New Year's Eve, Mark, Mimi, Roger, Maureen, Joanne, Collins and Angel gather to break back into Mark and Roger's apartment which they have been locked out of. (\"Happy New Year\"). Once Mark, Joanne and Maureen break in through the window, a voicemail reveals that Mark's footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a tabloid news company called Buzzline (\"Voice Mail #3\"). The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi, a former girlfriend of his, convinced him to change his mind. Mimi denies rekindling her relationship with Benny, but Roger is upset, and although they apologize to each other, Mimi goes to her drug dealer for a fix (\"Happy New Year B\").\n\nAround Valentine's Day, Mark tells the audience that Roger and Mimi have been living together, Collins and Angel are nowhere to be found, and Maureen and Joanne are preparing another protest; during rehearsal, Maureen criticizes Joanne's controlling behavior , while Joanne criticizes Maureen's promiscuity. They break up dramatically following an ultimatum (\" Take Me or Leave Me \"). Time progresses to spring (\"Seasons of Love B\"), where Roger and Mimi's relationship is strained by Mimi's escalating heroin usage and Roger's lasting jealousy and suspicion of Benny. Each alone, Roger and Mimi sing of love and loneliness, telling each other how they feel, as they watch Collins nurse Angel, whose health is declining due to AIDS (\"Without You\"). By the end of the summer, Mark continues to receive calls offering a corporate job at Buzzline (\"Voice Mail #4\"). A dance is performed representing all the couples' sex lives (\"Contact\"). At the climax of the number, the two former couples break up, and Angel suddenly dies in Collins' arms. At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories, with Collins being the last to reminisce (\"I'll Cover You [Reprise]\"). Mark expresses his fear of being the sole survivor when his friends eventually die of AIDS, and he finally accepts the corporate job offer (\"Halloween\"). Roger reveals that he is leaving for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, while Maureen and Joanne argue. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral, causing Maureen and Joanne to reconcile, but not Mimi and Roger. The group share a sad moment, knowing that between deaths and leaving, their close-knit friendships will become undone. Everyone leaves except Mark and Roger, where Mark tries to convince Roger to stay in New York. Roger, unable to handle Mimi's declining health, becomes furious with Mark and leaves. Mimi returns to say goodbye, overhearing everything Roger had said and, terrified, agrees to go to rehab, which Benny pays for (\"Goodbye Love\"). Collins is forcibly removed from the church for being unable to pay for Angel's funeral; Benny shows compassion by paying and offering Mark and Collins drinks. Collins accepts, causing the latter and Benny to rekindle their old friendship, but Mark turns down the offer due to work commitments.\n\nSome time later, both Mark and Roger simultaneously reach an artistic epiphany , as Roger finds his song in Mimi and Mark finds his film in Angel's memory; Roger decides to return to New York in time for Christmas, while Mark quits his job to devote his efforts to working on his own film (\"What You Own\"). The characters' parents, concerned and confused about their respective situations, leave several worried messages on their answering machines (\"Voice Mail #5\"). On Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but apparently, Mimi is missing, and no one has seen her. Benny's wife, discovering Benny's past relationship with Mimi, has pulled him out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code 'ANGEL'. Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who had been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, telling Roger that she loves him (\"Finale\"). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, revealing the depth of his feelings for her (\"Your Eyes\"). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a white light before a vision of Angel appeared, telling her to go back and stay with Roger. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is \"no day but today\" (\"Finale B\").",

First, her godson, Brichoux, whom she has not seen for many years; he is now the cook to a regiment of the French army. Second, her friend Lucienne Touquet. Third, Georgette's former guardian, Colonel Bolinger. Fourth, Lucienne's husband, Max Touquet, temporarily absenting himself from his military service; he is unaware that his wife is to visit Georgette, whom he hopes to interest in a play that he has written.\n\nMax and Brichoux meet as they approach the house. To gain access, Max persuades his comrade to exchange army papers, and Georgette allows him in, believing him to be her godson. Partly in revenge for her husband's roving eye and partly because she finds Max attractive, she does not discourage his evident interest in her.\n\nThe sudden arrival of Max's wife sets off a series of impersonations and swapped identities. Max, to avoid discovery by Lucienne, shaves off his moustache and beard and continues to maintain that he is Brichoux. Lucienne is not deceived, and she retaliates by a vigorous flirtation with Colonel Bolinger. To prevent the embarrassment of Georgette's exposure, her husband, Bibi, finds himself having to pose as a servant in his own house, while the Colonel assumes Max is Georgette's husband. Max, meanwhile, has to keep silent while his real wife receives the attentions of the Colonel. The real Brichoux intermittently appears and has to be explained away.\n\nMax, still unaware of Bibi's real identity, finds himself attending an evening event in his company. Bibi's indignation at his position breaks out continually. Eventually, Max confesses to Georgette that he is not her godson, and the chain of imposture unravels. The Colonel, finding that he has been flirting with Max's wife, hastily overlooks Max's deception and breach of military rules, and all ends happily.",

It proved to be DeSylva, Brown, and Henderson's biggest hit out of a string of topical musicals.",
        "synopsis": "### Original 1927 version\n\nWorld War I is over, the Roaring Twenties have arrived, and college campuses, such as fictional Tait College, are as much a social scene as an academic one (\"Opening Chorus\"). Football star Tom Marlowe neglects his studies and fails his astronomy class, which he had to pass to play in the big game. Charles Kenyon, his astronomy professor, gives Tom one more chance to pass the exam.\n\nBabe O'Day, a vivacious flapper , announces that she has broken up with Beef Saunders, a brawny and possessive football player. Babe wants a new boyfriend who does not care about old-fashioned rules of propriety (\"Flaming Youth\"). Tom asks his girlfriend Patricia to help him study for the test, but she is busy with sorority plans, so she recommends that he work with her studious cousin, Connie Lane. The boys marvel that Tom is remaining cheerful despite his circumstances, and Tom explains that college is the time for \"Happy Days\". Connie has a crush on Tom, but she says that she will \"Just Imagine\" that he is in love with her. Babe informs Bobby Randall, substitute player on the football team and Tom's roommate, that he is now her boyfriend. Connie and Tom meet to study and are initially uncomfortable working together, but soon they find they have a lot in common and similar philosophies of life (\" The Best Things In Life Are Free \").\n\nFriday morning, Tom and Bobby wake up in their dormitory, and Tom leaves to meet Connie to study. A door-slamming farce follows during which Babe, Beef, Kearney (the football team's trainer), and Sylvester, a freshman who idolizes Tom, all end up in Tom and Bobby's dorm room, and Bobby must keep the men from finding out that Babe is there.\n\nCouples walk together \"On the Campus\". Flo, an outspoken, energetic girl, leads the students in dancing the \"Varsity Drag\". Bobby tries to tell Babe he loves her but says he is too nervous to say it (\"Baby! What?\").\n\nTom takes his exam, but he later admits to Connie that during the test, he could not focus on astronomy; he was thinking about her. Tom declares that with Connie, he is \"Lucky in Love\". Professor Kenyon grades Tom's test and knows that Tom deserves a failing grade, but because Kenyon is an alumnus of Tait and a loyal football fan, he keeps that secret and instead gives Tom the lowest passing grade so he can play in the big game. At the pep rally that evening, the students sing the \"Tait Song\" as the school band plays. Bobby announces that if Tom wins the game tomorrow, Patricia has promised to marry him. During a chorus of \"Lucky in Love\", Connie faints and falls into Tom's arms (\"Finaletto\").\n\nOn Saturday, Patricia's sorority, Pi Beta Phi , is hosting a luncheon (\"The Girl of the Pi Beta Phi\"). The girls are excited about the football game (\"Today's the Day\"). Babe asks Bobby, who has been flirting with other girls, why he will not commit to her, and Bobby, who has sat on the bench all season and does not expect to play in the big game at all, tells her if he wins the game, he will marry her (\"In the Meantime\"). Connie confronts Tom and tears up her ticket to the game because she does not want to watch him win for Patricia, and Tom tells her he would rather lose the game. Flo says that she knows Tait is going to win and \"Good News\" must be on its way.\n\nOutside the entrance to the football field, Connie meets Professor Kenyon, who is on his way to the game. Professor Kenyon tells her the truth: Tom did not deserve to pass the test, but to help the football team, he gave Tom the passing grade. Babe explains to Connie that Tom did not betray her\u2014a long time ago, after a wild party involving homemade gin, Tom wrote a letter proposing to Patricia, and Patricia has kept the letter and is holding him to it.\n\nAt the end of the first half of the game, the score is 3\u20130 against Tait. Coach Johnson decides to let Bobby play in the second half. When the second half is almost over, Tom gets the ball and runs for a touchdown, but he is tackled by the opposing team. He fumbles the ball, and it flies in the air and improbably lands in Bobby's arms, and Bobby scores the winning touchdown. The students leave the game celebrating the victory (\"Good News\" (reprise)). Tom tells Connie, who watched the game through a knothole in the fence surrounding the stadium, that he fumbled because he knew he could not win the game for Patricia. He worries that his chances of being named for the All-American team are gone, but Connie helps him remember that \"The Best Things in Life Are Free\" (reprise). He asks Connie if she would marry him if he did not have to marry Patricia, and she says she would.\n\nThat evening, a dance is held at the boathouse (\"Varsity Drag\" (reprise)). Babe tells Bobby that since neither of them expected for him to win the game, he does not have to marry her. Bobby says he wants to marry Babe; everyone else thinks he is a football hero, but she knows who he really is. Patricia, not wanting to marry a man who is not really in love with her, tells Tom that he can marry Connie instead. The news spreads that Tom has been named to the All-American team. Tom and Connie meet Professor Kenyon, whom Tom resents for failing him the first time. Connie explains to Tom that Professor Kenyon passed him even though he did not deserve it. Tom realizes he has misjudged Kenyon and shakes his hand. After a final chorus of \"Good News\", Tom and Connie embrace.\n\n### Revised 1993 version\n\nTait College is still caught up in the social scene of the Roaring Twenties, and star football player Tom Marlowe is expected to lead the football team to victory (\"Good News\"). All the sorority girls are crazy about Tom (\"He's a Ladies' Man\"), but he is off limits since he is currently romancing Patricia Bingham, whose father is of one of the college's wealthiest benefactors. The football team, under the guidance of superstitious team trainer Pooch Kearney, is on the practice field getting ready for Saturday's Big Game against archrival Colton College (\"The Football Drill\").  Meanwhile, Bobby Randall, a substitute on the football team, is pleasantly shocked when Babe O'Day, a stylish flapper, pursues him. Babe has broken up with hulking Beef Saunders, her old boyfriend, and is looking for a new man (\"Button Up Your Overcoat\").\n\nSylvester (a college freshman whom no one knows the last name of)  found out that Tom has neglected his studies and has failed his astronomy final, which he needed to pass in order to play in the Big Game. Astronomy professor Charlotte Kenyon agrees to give Tom one more chance with a make-up exam. Privately Professor Kenyon tells Connie Lane, a studious coed, about her lost college romance with a football player (who is now the Tait football coach), and Connie wishes she could fall in love (\"Together/My Lucky Star\"). Football Coach Johnson, meanwhile, tells his confidant Pooch that he and Professor Kenyon dated and broke up in college (\"Together\"). They ask Patricia if she would tutor Tom for his exam, but she has to choose new drapes for the sorority house that night, and recommends her cousin Connie instead. As couples stroll romantically \"On the Campus\", Connie and Tom meet at the library to study. After an awkward beginning, Tom and Connie soon realize they have a lot in common and similar philosophies of life (\"The Best Things In Life Are Free\"). Across campus, Coach Johnson nostalgically serenades Professor Kenyon, hoping she will go easy when Tom retakes his exam. Initially charmed, she responds warmly (\"You're The Cream in my Coffee\"), but soon realizes he is trying to manipulate her and angrily sends him away.\n\nThe next morning, Tom takes his make-up exam as the students nervously await the results in the Malt Shoppe. Babe insists that they can not let school depress them and teaches everyone the latest dance, \"The Varsity Drag\". Sylvester bursts into the Malt Shoppe shouting that Tom has passed the test, and Tom finds Connie to tell her that he could not have done it without her help, declaring that she has made him \"Lucky In Love\". Babe tells Bobby she is in love with him, and even though Bobby's scared of Beef (who still considers Babe his girl), he agrees that they might be \"Lucky In Love\", too. Patricia interrupts everyone to publicly announce that her wealthy father has announced he will double his donation to the athletic department if Tom wins the Big Game for Tait and marries Pat. Connie is shocked, and Tom is dumbstruck as the students joyously sing another chorus of \"Lucky in Love\".\n\nIt is Saturday, and \"Today's the Day\" of the big game against Colton. Pat and the sorority girls are terribly excited, but are briefly saddened when they realize this is the last football game they will ever attend as students (\"The Girl of the Pi Beta Phi\")!  Bobby stops by the sorority open house (after all, they might have sandwiches) and commits to Babe (\"Never Swat a Fly\"), but only if they win the game. The students head to the Big Game singing \"The Tait Song\" as Pat tries to pressure Tom into marrying her. Tom feels that Tait's whole athletic program is at stake, and reluctantly tells Connie he can not stay with her. Connie resigns herself to \"Just Imagine\" Tom is still there with her.\n\nThe game begins, but Tom is so upset about Connie that by halftime, Tait is far behind Colton. Pooch urges the team to \"Keep Your Sunny Side Up\", while Professor Kenyon tries to persuade Babe and Connie that the three of them should devise a strategy to pursue their men, and help them win the game. Through their combined efforts, Bobby scores an unexpected touchdown, Tait wins the big game, Sylvester is William Randolph Hearst's nephew who knows Bobby told the paper that Tom planned the game, and the happy couples, Tom and Connie, Bobby and Babe, and Coach Johnson and Professor Kenyon, all end up together (\"Finale\").",

It was produced in the West End in 1998 and has been revived several times since then and toured extensively.",
        "synopsis": "Act 1\n\nIn a small church in Louisiana the congregation is about to sing a song, \"Vaults of Heaven\". After the song, the preacher concludes his sermon, and the congregation go their separate ways (Overture).  Poor Baby complains that \"I Never Get What I Pray For\", before Poor Baby, Swallow and Brat meet Ed, who is about to drown some kittens. Swallow manages to save them and the kids realise that they should have been \"Home By Now.\" Earl is looking for a place to put up a tent for a revival meeting, where \"folks go to dance with snakes\" in order to test their faith in Jesus. Back at their home, their father Boone tries to convince them that \"It Just Doesn't Get Any Better Than This,\" before recalling what his wife used to say: \"Whistle Down The Wind.\" As Poor Baby puts it, 'Ma sang it better,' and Swallow leaves to go feed the kittens, while singing \"Whistle Down The Wind\" to herself. In the barn, she prays that God will look after the kittens, but is startled by a loud cry, and a man jumps out at her. When she asks who he is, he only manages to moan \"Jesus Christ..\" before he collapses. She, Brat and Poor Baby promise they won't tell anyone that he is there: \"The Vow.\"\n\nIn a bar where Ed is singing \"Cold\" to entertain the townspeople. The Sheriff arrives at the bar to warn the town that there is an escaped killer on the loose, and that he could be hiding out nearby. In the barn, The Man (Arthur Blakey in the source novel, unnamed in the play) wakes to find himself surrounded by children, who all promise to take care of him and to keep his existence a secret. Left alone, he sings of \"Unsettled Scores.\" Later that night, Swallow brings him some food, and asks him if he will bring her mother back: \"Being the Son of God, it can't be that difficult for you!\" She sings \"If Only,\" thinking of the way she wishes things could be.\n\nCandy, a young black girl, and Amos, a white boy, sing of longing to get away from the town they live in, to a place they can be free: \"Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts.\" The townspeople sing of how the town used to be, and what it must be again: \"Safe Haven.\"\n\nThe children are discussing what it would mean if the mysterious man really was Jesus Christ, and what a difference it would make to their lives: \"Long Overdue for a Miracle.\" They realise that if they do everything right, they could save him, and that this could be the night \"When Children Rule The World.\" In the barn, they beg The Man to tell them a story, and he complies, telling them a story which he says will be in the next Testament, \"Annie Christmas\". When he finishes, they ask repeatedly what the moral is, and when he admits that he doesn't know, they offer him gifts and promise that \"No Matter What,\" they'll always love him. The adults prepare to hunt down the escaped killer, their anger in complete contrast to the children's innocence and happiness.\n\nAct 2\n\nThe townspeople are again preparing to hunt down the killer (Safe Haven Reprise). The Man asks Swallow to retrieve a package for him, 4 miles away at the train tunnel, and on noticing that she is shaking, tells her to \"Try Not To Be Afraid.\" Amos arrives at the barn to visit Swallow before he leaves town with Candy, and asks if she will tell him her big secret before he goes. He says if they share secrets, they'll have to seal them with a kiss, and that \"A Kiss Is A Terrible Thing To Waste.\" The Man, hiding in the barn, overhears their conversations and joins in as Amos sings the song, realising that they seem to correspond to his life- \"The emptiest words that there'll ever be, it could have been me- it could have been me.\" Swallow asks Amos to take her to the train tunnel before he can kiss her. There, she retrieves the package, but is almost killed by a train, though Amos manages to push her out of the way in time. \"You saved my life, Amos! That means I owe you one now!\" she says, then she tells him her secret: \"What would you say if I told you Jesus had come back? He's back, Amos! Jesus is in my barn!\" They are interrupted by the Sheriff, who thinks he has discovered the killer, and is rather disappointed to find it is only Swallow and Amos. Earl has been hiding in the train tunnel the whole time and has overheard Swallow's secret. At home, Swallow finds Poor Baby, who is upset because his kitten, which he asked \"Jesus\" to look after, has died; Swallow suggests they ask \"Jesus\" why he allowed the kitten to die: \"If Only (Reprise).\" In the barn, The Man tells them another story to explain why the kitten died: \"Charlie Christmas,\" saying that everyone dies in the end, \"even the cat, even old Charlie...even your mother.\"\n\nOn the highway, Candy waits for Amos: \"Off Ramp Exit To Paradise,\" but when he eventually turns up, its only to ask her where Swallow is, as he says she's in trouble. When he runs off, Candy meets Earl, who says he knows Swallow's big secret, and knows why Amos is rushing off in such a hurry. When he tells Candy, she decides to get back at Amos and Swallow by telling the whole town Swallow's secret, interrupting the revival meeting: \"Wrestle with the Devil.\" The townspeople decide that the killer has to be found once and for all, in order to save the children: \"The Hunt.\"\n\nSwallow runs back to the barn to warn The Man that the whole town is heading for the barn to catch him- when he says he will have to try and run for it, she begs him to stay, promising that she will protect him. He tries to make her realize that he is not the person she thinks he is: \"Nature of the Beast.\" But she says that she realizes that now, and simply needs him to be whoever he is. When the townspeople get to the barn, they find it surrounded by the kids who are determined not to let them hurt The Man. Swallow is trapped in the barn with him, and he says he will take her hostage, but quickly changes his mind and instead pushes her out of the barn to safety. Left alone, he sets fire to the barn, so that when Swallow manages to get back in, there's no trace of him left. Swallow is convinced he hasn't left for good, saying, \"He'll be back...I just know he will.\" Her father tries to make her see that he wasn't Jesus. She still isn't completely convinced, asking, \"But how do you know?\" The family, together again, sing \"Whistle Down The Wind.\"",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nOfficer Lockstock, a policeman, grimly welcomes the audience, assisted by the street urchin Little Sally. According to the pair, a twenty-year drought has caused a terrible water shortage, making private toilets unthinkable. All restroom activities are done in public toilets (Public Amenities) controlled by a megacorporation called \" Urine Good Company\" (referred to as the UGC). To control water consumption, citizens have to pay to use the Amenities (\"Too Much Exposition\"). There are harsh laws ensuring that people pay to urinate, and if the laws are broken, the offender is sent to a place called \"Urinetown\", never to return.\n\nThe oppressed masses huddle in line at the poorest, filthiest urinal in town, Public Amenity #9, which is run by the rigid, harshly authoritarian Penelope Pennywise and her assistant, dashing young everyman Bobby Strong. Trouble ensues when Bobby's father Joseph \"Old Man\" Strong, unable to afford his daily urinal admission, asks Pennywise to let him go for free \"just this once.\" After Old Man Strong's plea is dismissed (\"It's a Privilege to Pee\"), he urinates on the street, and Officers Lockstock and Barrel soon arrest him and escort him off to Urinetown (\"It's a Privilege to Pee (Reprise)\").\n\nLater that day, in the corporate offices of Urine Good Company, CEO Caldwell B. Cladwell is discussing the new fee hikes with Senator Fipp, a politician firmly in Cladwell's pocket, when Cladwell's beautiful daughter, Hope Cladwell, arrives as the UGC's new fax/copy girl. As an introduction, the UGC staff sing a song praising their leader (\"Mr. Cladwell\").\n\nOfficers Lockstock and Barrel discuss the journey to Urinetown and how it reduces everyone, even the toughest, to screams (\"The Cop Song\"). Hope enters and encounters Bobby; distraught over his father's arrest and wondering if he could have done something, tells Hope that his heart feels either cold or empty. Hope responds that the only answer is to follow his heart. The two realize that they both want a new world where people can be happy and pee for free. United by their belief, they fall in love (\"Follow Your Heart\"). Little Sally asks Officer Lockstock what Urinetown is like, but Lockstock replies that its power lies in its mystery and he cannot flippantly reveal that \"there is no Urinetown, we just kill people\", and that the reveal will not come until Act II, \"with everybody singing and things like that.\"\n\nThe next day, Cladwell's assistant, Mr. McQueen, announces the new fee hikes set upon the urinals. Bobby concludes that the laws are wrong. Opening the doors of the urinal, despite Ms. Pennywise's protests, he begins a pee-for-free rebellion (\"Look at the Sky\").\n\nPennywise rushes to the offices of UGC, where she informs Cladwell of the revolution. The two share a moment, but are interrupted by the situation at hand. Cladwell vows to crush the rebellion, frightening Hope, then uses a series of increasingly convoluted metaphors involving killing a bunny to tell Hope that their privilege and responsibility is to oppress the poor (\"Don't Be the Bunny\").\n\nCladwell, McQueen, Fipp, Pennywise, Lockstock and Barrel arrive at  Amenity #9 to snuff out the uprising. Learning that Hope is Cladwell's daughter, Bobby realizes that the only way out of the trap is to kidnap Hope to use as leverage against Cladwell. The rebel poor escape with Hope as their hostage. The police give chase, but the slow-motion choreography makes it impossible for the police to catch them. Lockstock vows to catch the poor as he tells the audience to enjoy intermission (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n### Act II\n\nLockstock welcomes everyone back, updates the audience on the situation, and tells them that the rebel poor are holed up in a secret hideout somewhere, gesturing to a large sign that reads \"Secret Hideout\". The sign leads to the sewers, where the rebels are holding Hope hostage. The rebels wonder what Urinetown is, and two of them, Little Becky Two-Shoes and Hot Blades Harry, explain their theories. Cladwell orders Lockstock to search harder for the rebels, threatening to send everyone to Urinetown if Hope is not found. Bobby and his mother Josephine hand out memos to the other Assistant Custodians, hoping that they will join them. Bobby is sure that Urinetown is nothing but a lie designed to scare the poor people. Lockstock catches Little Sally, but his threat of Urinetown doesn't work, because according to her, they are already there; it \"isn't so much a place as it is a metaphysical place\" that they are all in, including Lockstock. She escapes before Lockstock can ask her what \"metaphysical\" means. (\"What is Urinetown?\")\n\nConvinced that Bobby, Josephine, and Little Sally have been captured, the rebels, particularly Hot Blades Harry and Little Becky Two-Shoes, decide that the best way to get revenge on Cladwell is to kill Hope (\"Snuff That Girl\"). They are about to kill her when Bobby bursts in and reminds the rebels that their purpose is more than just revenge. He explains that he made a promise to free all the people of the land. One of the rebels reminds Bobby that the only words he said were \"Run, everybody, run for your lives, run.\" Bobby explains that in the heat of battle the cry of freedom sounds something like (\"Run, Freedom, Run!\"). Invigorated, the poor rally around Bobby, but balk at his statement that the violent fight could take decades. Just then, Pennywise bursts into the secret hideout telling Bobby that Cladwell wants him to come to the UGC headquarters. Bobby goes, but only after the impatient rebels remind him that if anything happens to him, Hope will be killed. Pennywise fiercely swears that if any of the rebels harm Hope, she will have Bobby sent off to Urinetown. Bobby says goodbye to Hope, apologizes, and tells her to think of what they have (\"Follow Your Heart (Reprise)\").\n\nAt the UGC headquarters, Bobby is offered a suitcase full of cash and full amnesty to the rebels as long as Hope is returned and the people agree to the new fee hikes. Bobby refuses, and demands free access for the people. Cladwell orders the cops to escort Bobby to Urinetown\u2014even if it means that the rebel poor will kill Hope. Horrified, Pennywise marvels at the depth of Cladwell's evil. Cladwell has her arrested as well. She, Hope, and Fipp sing of their regrets of falling for Cladwell's schemes. Meanwhile, Bobby is led to the top of the UGC building, and learns the truth: Urinetown is death. He regrets having ever listened to his heart. Lockstock and Barrel throw him off the building to his death, effectively shocking the audience (\"Why Did I Listen To That Man?\").\n\nLittle Sally returns to the hideout in a shocked daze, having just heard Bobby's last words. The ghost of Bobby sings, along with Little Sally, his last words, which are directed to Hope (\"Tell Her I Love Her\"). His last words encourage the rebels \"to fight for what they know is right\", and that \"the time is always now.\" Just as the rebels are about to murder Hope in revenge, Pennywise enters and offers herself instead, proclaiming herself to be Hope's mother. The poor reel back, shocked by this unexpected twist. Hope convinces the rebels to let her lead them, and she, Penny, and the poor march to the UGC offices. En route, they kill Officer Barrel (who had just confessed his love to Officer Lockstock), Senator Fipp, and Mrs. Millennium (a UGC employee, typically double-cast with Little Becky Two-Shoes) (\"We're Not Sorry\").\n\nHope reveals to her father that she is still alive. Cladwell is overjoyed, until the rest of the poor reveal themselves. Hope tells him that his reign of terror is over, and that he will be sent to the same place he sent Bobby and all those \"who wouldn't\u2014or couldn't\u2014meet his criminal fee hikes\". Cladwell unsuccessfully pleads to the people that he is their only chance at seeing tomorrow. After he and Pennywise reminisce about their past romance (\"We're Not Sorry (Reprise)\"), he is led to the roof, shouting that he regrets nothing, and however cruel he might have been, he \"kept the pee off the street and the water in the ground\", before being thrown off.\n\nWith the town finally at peace, the age of fear is over and the people look forward to a bright new day. The Urine Good Company is renamed \"The Bobby Strong Memorial Toilet Authority\" and the people are henceforth allowed \"to pee whenever they like, as much as they like, for as long as they like, and with whomever they like\" (\"I See A River\").\n\nHowever, the town's newfound urinary bliss is short-lived, as its limited water supply quickly disappears. Lockstock tells the audience that, as strict as the UGC's rules were, they kept the people from squandering the limited water supply; now, much of the population dies of thirst. It is insinuated that Hope suffers a terrible death and \"joins her father\" at the hand of the people for her actions in depleting the water supply, but the remaining townsfolk will wage on, declaring that \"This [town] is Urinetown! Always it's been Urinetown!\" The final words of the musical are \"Hail Malthus !\", and the audience is subtly encouraged to think about whether or not their way of life is sustainable.",

        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nJack Singer and his girlfriend of five years, Betsy Nolan, are in love (\"I Love Betsy\"). But when he tries to buy her an engagement ring, he suffers a panic attack as he remembers his mother's dying wish from ten years earlier\u2014that he never marry, because no woman could love him as she did (\"Never Get Married\"). Betsy tells Jack that she can't wait indefinitely for him to deal with his issues (\"Anywhere But Here\"). He proposes that they elope to Las Vegas, and she accepts. They check into the Milano hotel (\"When You Say Vegas\"), and Betsy immediately catches the attention of Tommy Korman, a wealthy gambler; she bears an uncanny resemblance to his late wife Donna, an avid sunbather who died of skin cancer (\"Out of the Sun\"). He decides to steal Betsy from Jack (\"The Invitation/Forever Starts Tonight\"). Tommy invites Jack to a private poker game, so Betsy shops for a wedding dress (\"Betsy's Getting Married/The Game\"). Tommy beats Jack's straight flush with a royal flush, leaving Jack owing Tommy $58,000. Tommy proposes that Jack can be spared physical violence if he agrees to let Betsy spend the rest of the weekend with Tommy (\"Come to an Agreement\"). Betsy is incensed, but agrees to meet Tommy. Tommy charms Betsy with recollections of Donna and with his pride in their son who now has a wife and baby. Tommy shocks Jack by informing Betsy that he wants to spend their weekend together in Hawaii; Betsy is so angry at Jack that she agrees to leave with Tommy. Jack decides he must take action (\"Do Something\"), but is too late to stop them from boarding a plane; he buys a ticket to follow them.\n\n### Act Two\n\nThe travelers arrive in Hawaii (\"Hawaii/Waiting for You\"). Jack is approached by Teihutu and Mahi, who offer to guide him (\"Every Day Is Happy in Hawaii\") but are secretly employed by Tommy to distract him; Mahi attempts to seduce Jack (\"Friki-Friki\"), but fails. Betsy gets along well with Tommy and his son's family, unaware that they are hired actors. She shares a tender moment with Tommy as they sing an old standard together (\"You Made the Wait Worthwhile\"). Betsy refrains from being intimate with him, but Tommy confides in his henchman Johnny Sandwich that he still thinks his plan will be successful (\"A Little Luck\"). Meanwhile, Mahi is moved by Jack's plight and takes him to a sacred grove where a mother's curse can be broken (\"The Garden of Disappointed Mothers\"). Jack confronts his mother (\"Isn't That Enough?\"), who relents and agrees to let him and Betsy be happy\u2014but only if Jack proves himself as a man. Tommy plies Betsy with drinks and tells her that Jack only owed him $800; she is so outraged (and drunk) that she kisses Tommy and demands that he immediately marry her in Las Vegas. Mahi informs Jack that Tommy and Betsy are leaving Hawaii, but he is unable to catch them. No reasonable travel options are available (\"Airport Song\"), but Jack manages to join a troupe of Elvis impersonators making a \"pilgrimage\" to Las Vegas. However, when the plane approaches Las Vegas, he learns that he must skydive into the city (\"Higher Love\"). He panics, but ultimately makes the jump, thus proving himself (\"Elvii In Flight\"). Betsy, having sobered up, rethinks her decision (\"I've Been Thinking\"), and finally rejects Tommy after Johnny accidentally confirms the true amount of Jack's debt. Jack parachutes into Betsy's arms and they marry on the spot (\"Honeymoon in Vegas (Finale)\")",

        "synopsis": "It's 1979 in New York City. Marvin, his son Jason, his psychiatrist Mendel and his male lover Whizzer introduce themselves, along with Marvin's ex-wife, Trina (\"Four Jews in a Room Bitching\"). Marvin steps forward to explain his situation: he has left his wife, Trina, for Whizzer, but explains that he wants to and is attempting to forge a new family situation with the addition of Whizzer.\n\nTrina, on Marvin's recommendation, pays a visit to Mendel, where she wearily wonders how her life has turned out this way. Mendel, who is instantly attracted to her, tries to console her (\"Tight-Knit Family/Love is Blind\"). Meanwhile, Marvin and Whizzer comment on their relationship: the two have very little in common, apart from the fact that they both love fighting and are insanely attracted to each other (\"The Thrill of First Love\").\n\nThe cast presents an interlude of Marvin at his psychiatry appointment with Mendel. In Part One, Mendel asks Marvin about his relationship with Whizzer and Marvin weighs the pros and cons of the relationship, ultimately concluding that he does love Whizzer. In Part Two, Mendel shifts the topic to Trina, and the session becomes one where Mendel, obviously aroused, interrogates Marvin about his ex-wife's bedroom habits. In Part Three, Marvin and Jason provide counterpoint on their strained relationship (\"Marvin at the Psychiatrist, a Three-Part Mini-Opera\").\n\nJason, who is 10, is very worried that, because his father is gay, he will turn out similarly. He begins to act up. His parents try to convince him to see Mendel for a therapy session and fail; however, Whizzer convinces him and he agrees to see Mendel (\"My Father's a Homo/Everyone tells Jason to See a Psychiatrist\").\n\nMeanwhile, Marvin is trying to pigeon-hole Whizzer into the role of homemaker, and they fight. Trina complains to Mendel how her role in the family dynamic is being phased out as Whizzer becomes increasingly prominent in Marvin and Jason's lives. Marvin, being blamed for the family's strife by both Whizzer and Trina, continues to insist that all participants get along together as one extended family (\"This Had Better Come To A Stop\").\n\nJason is acting up again, and Trina phones Mendel frantically to come for dinner and therapy. Mendel arrives and immediately charms Trina. (\"Please Come To My House\") He and Jason settle down for a therapy session in which Jason frets about his future and his similarities to his father. Mendel encourages him to simply relax and enjoy life. After several such dinners and therapy sessions, Jason asks Mendel what his romantic intentions are towards Trina, and Mendel makes a marriage proposal to Trina, which she accepts (\"A Marriage Proposal\"). Marvin feels defensive over losing his family to his psychiatrist, and he and Mendel argue. (\"Tight-Knit Family (Reprise)\").\n\nTrina reflects on her situation: she is tired of the man's world she lives in, and even though she knows that Mendel is the same kind of man Marvin is, slightly childish and neurotic, she recognizes he loves her, and she could do a lot worse. The four men of the show suddenly appear, singing a hymn to masculinity in all its aspects, the three adults singing in a falsetto to match Jason's unbroken voice. Once they exit, Trina returns, deciding to enjoy her life for what it is and be happy. (\"Trina's Song/March of the Falsettos/Trina's Song (Reprise)\")\n\nMarvin tries to teach Whizzer to play chess. Whizzer convinces Marvin to let him win, which he agrees to, but bitterness and ill feelings boil over once he does, and the two break up (\"The Chess Game\"). Meanwhile, Trina and Mendel move in together and start their life as an engaged couple, feeling unsure of where they stand, while Whizzer is forced to leave his and Marvin's apartment (\"Making A Home\"). As he packs, Whizzer reflects on himself and his past relationships, and comes to the conclusion that he does not love Marvin (\"The Games I Play\").\n\nMarvin receives Trina and Mendel's wedding invitation, sending him into a rage. Confronting Trina in front of Mendel and Jason, he accuses her of trying to ruin his life, before he impulsively slaps her (\"Marvin Hits Trina\"). Shocked by Marvin's outburst, the characters all reflect on the events leading up to it. (\"I Never Wanted to Love You\").\n\nAlthough Marvin has broken up with Whizzer and ruined his relationship with Trina, he attempts salvage his relationship with Jason, who, to his immense relief, has just discovered women. Marvin sits Jason down, telling him that he loves him and no matter what kind of man Jason turns out to be, Marvin will always be there for him. (\"Father to Son\")",

It is based on a series of four novels by Swedish author Vilhelm Moberg detailing a family's poverty-driven migration from Sweden to America in the mid-19th century: The Emigrants (1949), Unto a Good Land (1952), The Settlers (1956), and The Last Letter Home (1959).",
        "synopsis": "For 25 years Nils has worked with an iron rod to move stones from the fields of his farm Korpamoen in Ljuder's parish, Sm\u00e5land , Sweden.  One day he slips and a big rock rolls onto him, breaking both his hip and femur . As a cripple he cannot work and is forced to sell the farm. His oldest son, Karl Oskar, barely of age, convinces Nils to sell the farm to him, and he buys it for 1700 riksdaler .\n\nKarl Oskar visits his girlfriend Kristina, who waits for him and pictures him making his way through the familiar surroundings (\"Duvem\u00e5la Pasture\"). Karl Oskar tells her that he has bought his father's farm, and can now marry her (\"My Lust For You\"). They marry and begin a life together, but times are hard because of bad harvests (King of Stone's Kingdom). Kristina worries that they cannot support their growing family, and suggests to her husband that they take steps to prevent another pregnancy. Karl Oskar says that it would be a betrayal of his love for her.\n\nKarl Oskar's younger brother, Robert, is on his way to begin work as a farm hand on a nearby farm. He stops by a stream and wishes he was as free as the water (\"Out Towards a Sea\").\n\nKristina is pregnant again, and she and Karl Oskar worry that they won't be able to feed their children during winter, because of a drought and bad harvest. An angry Karl Oskar tells God that since he took their hay last year, he might as well take the rest. Shortly thereafter lightning strikes the barn, setting it on fire. Kristina tells her husband that he got what he wished for (\"Bad Harvest\").\n\nYoung Arvid, who works as a farmhand beside Robert at the farm of Nybacken, is unjustly punished by his mistress; in desperation, he sets out to kill her with an axe, but Robert stops him.  The two boys dream of a better world, a world across the ocean, called North America , which Robert has read about.\n\nKristina loves her home, and is happy to be married to Karl Oskar and have their three children (Bl\u00e5klintst\u00e4cket/Kristina's Apple Tree). One day Robert returns home, having been beaten by his master. He refuses to go back, and asks for his share of the inheritance so he can leave Sweden and travel to North America. Karl Oskar confesses that he has been considering the same thing; he and Robert try to convince Kristina that she will love America, but she is too afraid (\"No\"). Kristina asks her beloved Uncle, Danjel, to help her change her husband's mind. In a dream, Danjel has a vision where he is called to fulfill his uncle's work of restoring God's Kingdom on earth and to lead the people away from the false teachings. One night he gathers a group of outcasts to celebrate communion (\"Little Group\"); the gathering is disrupted by the Provost and the local authorities, who scatter the group and intend to bring them all to justice for breaking the law. One of the persons in the room, Ulrika of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6hl, a former prostitute who is now born again through Christ and lives in Danjel's house, is furious over the hypocrisy of their persecutors, one of whom used to be her customer. Ulrika vows that her illegitimate daughter Elin will never have to suffer because her mother was a whore (\"Never\").\n\nKristina, and Karl Oskar's parents, try to convince him to stay, pointing out the advantages of home (\"Golden Wheat Fields\"). When Kristina makes christening porridge for the new baby, their starving oldest daughter (Anna) eats it, but the grain swells in her stomach, and she dies (\"Come To Me Everyone\"). Realising that the poverty in Sweden is just as dangerous as anything overseas, Kristina agrees to move. They visit the Provost and write down their reasons for emigrating in the church book. The provost warns them of all the horrors waiting in America, saying that God will wipe America off the face of the earth within fifty years. The emigrants begin their journey. Karl Oskar, Kristina, their children and Robert have gained some companions; Danjel and his family are moving to escape religious persecution , along with Ulrika and her daughter, and so is Arvid, who has also been living with Danjel. A group of 16 people leaves Ljuder, never to return (\"We Open Up the Gateways.\")\n\nThe ship turns out to be smaller than they had thought it would be. Karl Oskar must bunk with the bachelors. For the first time in their marriage, Kristina and Karl Oskar are separated (\"Farmers at Sea\"). One day Kristina discovers lice on her body. She is horrified, since she has never had them before in her life, and blames Ulrika, who has none (\"Lice\").\nAn old woman on the ship, Fina-Kajsa, is traveling to find her son in America, carrying a big grindstone because she has heard grindstones are very expensive in America. Fina-Kajsa tells the story of how lice came to be.\n\nOne night in the middle of a storm Karl Oskar is woken by his oldest son, Johan, who tells him that his mother is bleeding. Kristina, pregnant with her fifth child, has fallen ill with scurvy. The captain does what he can to help her, and Karl Oskar sits by her side, waking through the longest night of his life (\"Stay\"). When morning finally comes Kristina is alive, but Danjel's wife, who has been ill for a long time without telling her husband, has died (\"Burial at Sea\").\nFina-Kajsa has a letter from her son, saying that he has plowed 100 acres of fields with good soil. Karl Oskar asks where this is, and Fina-Kajsa reads: \" Taylors Falls , Minnesota .\" Easy to remember, Karl Oskar points out (\"Minne\" meaning \"memory\" in Swedish).\n\nOn Midsummer 's Eve land is finally spotted, after two and a half months on the ocean. The sight of all the New Yorkers out for a Sunday walk overwhelms the immigrants, and so does the foreign language (\"A Sunday in Battery Park\"). An apple given by one friendly lady to the children reminds Kristina of home. Johan asks if they can go home now. Kristina remembers her motherland, where they now are celebrating midsummer (\"Home\"). The group travels by train and steamboat, amazed at how wide America is (\"Travel Through America\"). At a land grab Karl Oskar's and Kristina's daughter Lill-M\u00e4rta disappears. At the last moment, when the paddle steamer already started moving, Ulrika finds M\u00e4rta and returns the girl to her parents.\n\nOne night the immigrants are left on a pier in Stillwater. It is dark and rainy, and no one understands what they say; they are completely abandoned, until Baptist pastor Henry O Jackson shows up and offers the immigrants shelter, warmth and food. \nAs Danjel prays, thanking the Lord for the food, they find out that they have a word in common: \"Amen.\"\nRobert tells his friend Arvid of his plans to go on the California trail and dig for gold and asks him to come along. Karl Oskar is highly skeptical, but his brother is firmly set on leaving (\"The Dream of Gold\"). The women are amazed by how Pastor Jackson handles household chores, and begin to understand that women are more equal in this country. The immigrants struggle to communicate with Reverend Jackson (\"To Think That Men Like Him Can Exist\").\n\nKarl Oskar and Kristina continue to Lake Ki-Chi-Saga, where they intend to build their new home. Here, with help from Ulrika, Kristina gives birth to a healthy son.  Karl Oskar reads the Christmas Gospel for his little family, and Kristina tells her new-born child about the land where she was born, and of her astrakan apple tree which is still carrying fruit (\"My Astrakan\").\n\nA few years have passed by. The settlers gather and celebrate their choice to move to this New World (\"The Superiors\"). But Kristina lies awake at night, tormented by her longing for Sweden, and begs God to let her return (\"Bright Evenings in Springtime\"). Karl Oskar tells her that if God tries to move her back he will reach out his hand and keep her by his side. He shows her the boots that belonged to their daughter Anna, and reminds her why they left Sweden. He plans to write to her father and ask for some seeds from her astrakan tree, in the hope that a new tree planted at their new settlement will help her feel at home.\n\nWhen Christmas comes Karl Oskar has bought Kristina a new stove, called the Queen of the Prairie. Their friends gather at New Duvem\u00e5la to celebrate Christmas, and they all marvel at the new stove (\"The Queen of the Prairie\"). The fun gathering is disrupted when Karl Oskar gets into a fight with N\u00f6jd, a fur hunter, who tells Karl Oskar that he does not own the land he farms, which is stolen from the Indians. Karl Oskar describes his plight back home in Sweden, and tells N\u00f6jd how hard he has worked to turn the wild grass on his property into a home and a farm (\"Wild Grass\").\n\nOne evening in June, a strange man is spotted down at the lake shore. Robert has come back from the gold fields. Arvid is not with him, but Robert has a lot of money, which Karl Oskar deposits at the bank. Kristina finds Arvid's watch and demands to know where Arvid is. Robert tells her that he eventually reconciled to his fate and then tells her the story of how they went searching for gold, but ended up lost in the desert. Arvid drank poisoned water and died (\"Robert's Story\"). \nThe money Robert gives to Karl Oskar turns out to be counterfeit . Karl Oskar becomes furious (\"Wild Cat Money\"), believing that his brother knew this. Robert walks out to the woods where he finds a lonely stream, the symbol of the freedom he never found. He has caught yellow fever, and by the stream he dies (\"Out Towards a Sea (Reprise)\").\n\nKarl Oskar and Kristina plant seeds in their new farmlands, and a great wheat field is grown (\"The Field\"), along with Kristina's apple tree, planted from seeds from home.\n\nBack in Sweden Ulrika was a whore and no respectable man would look at her twice. Now she tells Kristina she has had several suitors (\"Won't You Marry Me?\") and has decided to marry Pastor Jackson, with whom she has been in love since they met; she will convert to Baptism. Kristina and Ulrika cherish their friendship (\"A Miracle of the Lord\"). Kristina comes to watch her friend being baptised by Pastor Jackson (\"Down to the Sacred Wave\").\n\nKristina suffers a miscarriage and Ulrika takes her to the doctor, then brings Karl Oskar the bad news that, after her miscarriage, Kristina's body cannot take much more. Another childbirth would mean her death (\"Miscarriage\"). A devastated Kristina thinks of all the bad things that have happened to her, having to leave her home, losing her child and now her husband's love. She desperately prays to God, not knowing what she will do if he isn't real (\"You Have To Be There\").\n\nAs time passes, Kristina begins to feel better. One day the settlers gather for a big harvest feast (\"Harvest Feast\"), and she tells Uncle Danjel of her wish to live long enough to see her children grow up. She also tells him about her apple tree, which finally is blooming and will give fruits to the autumn. After the feast Kristina tries to convince Karl Oskar that it is God's meaning that husband and wife should be together, and that if God wants her to live she will live, but if He wants her to die He will take her regardless. Karl Oskar argues, until she repeats the words he said to her so many years ago (\"Here You Have Me Again\").\n\nDuring the civil war , the state of Minnesota gets a civil war of its own, an Indian uprising. Chaos, murder and violence begin to spread (\"Red Iron/The Sioux uprising\") at the same time as Kristina finds out that she is once again carrying a child. She tells Karl Oskar, who is worried. She turns to God and asks for help to comfort him, since she is so weak and tired herself (\"Help Me Comfort\"). The settlers have to leave their homes as the uprising spreads (\"Where Do We Belong?\").

Adapted from Elliott's 1994 film The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert , the musical tells the story of two drag queens and a trans woman , who contract to perform a drag show at a resort in Alice Springs, a resort town in the remote Australian desert. As they head west from Sydney aboard their lavender bus, Priscilla, the three friends come to the forefront of a comedy of errors, encountering a number of strange characters, as well as incidents of homophobia, while widening comfort zones and finding new horizons.\n\nProduced by Allan Scott in coalition with Back Row Productions, Michael Chugg , Michael Hamlyn and John Frost , the Simon Phillips -directed and Ross Coleman-choreographed original production of Priscilla debuted in Australia at the Lyric Theatre, Sydney in October 2006.

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nThe drag queen Mitzi Mitosis \u2013 stage name of Anthony \"Tick\" Belrose \u2013 is performing at a club (\"Downtown\" [Australia and London]/\"I've Never Been to Me\"; \"It's Raining Men\" [Broadway]) when his estranged wife Marion, calls in for a favour. While Tick is offstage, fellow drag queen Miss Understanding performs her own number (\"What's Love Got to Do With It?\"). From the phone in Tick's dressing room, Marion reveals that she needs an act for a few weeks at her business in distant Alice Springs , Australia. Tick is at first reluctant, but Marion informs him that part of the reason she's asking is because their now eight-year-old son Benji wants to meet his father (\"I Say A Little Prayer\"). Tick confides in another fellow drag queen Farrah, before deciding he will leave for Alice Springs . Tick then calls a friend, a transgender woman named Bernadette to join him but Bernadette's husband has just died. The pair meet at the funeral (\"Don't Leave Me This Way\"), where Bernadette agrees to join him. Tick also asks a friend Felicia \u2013 stage name of Adam Whitely \u2013 to come with them (\"Venus\"/\"Material Girl\"), with Bernadette taking an immediate dislike to his show-off performance style. Nonetheless, the newly formed trio buy a \"budget Barbie campervan \" they nickname \"Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\" (\"Go West\"). Tick informs them that the trip is a favour to his wife, but does not tell them it is also to meet his son who wants to see him (\"I Say A Little Prayer (Reprise)\"). As the journey to Alice Springs begins, Adam angers Bernadette after making transphobic jokes about her life before transitioning. Later the group arrives at a bar in Broken Hill , in full drag, and start a bar dance party (\"I Love the Nightlife\"), but when they return to the bus learn that the townspeople wrote hateful statements on the bus in spray paint. Tick is very upset, but Adam and Bernadette comfort him (\"Both Sides, Now\"/\"True Colors\"). While on the road, Adam practices his lip-syncing as Felicia sitting in the giant high heel on the roof of the van (\"Follie! Delirio vano \u00e8 questo! Sempre libera (from La traviata)\"). The next morning, Priscilla breaks down and Adam buys lavender paint to erase the vandalism (\"Colour My World\"). They manage to get the locals of another town on their side and meet Bob, a mechanic from a small town nearby who agrees to help fix Priscilla. The group celebrates that they've found people that accept them (\"I Will Survive\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe second act opens with a group of bogans singing (\"Thank God I'm A Country Boy\"). Bernadette talks with Bob and learns that when he was in Sydney, he saw her when she was a young \"Les Girl\" (\"A Fine Romance\"). The two begin to grow feelings for each other. Later in a bar (\"Thank God I'm A Country Boy Reprise\"), the trio is about to perform (\"Shake Your Groove Thing\") when Cynthia, Bob's wife, interrupts their act by \"popping\" ping-pong balls (\"Pop Muzik\"). After this, the trio leaves, leaving Bob to wonder about his feelings for Bernadette (\"A Fine Romance (Reprise)\"). All of a sudden, Bernadette asks if he wants a free ride back to his real home, in which he agrees (\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun\"). Later when they arrive, Adam dresses up like a woman to try to meet men (\"Hot Stuff\"), but ends up getting chased and nearly becomes the victim of a hate crime until Bernadette rescues him by kicking one of his attackers. Later as they arrive in Alice Springs, Tick reflects on the trip after someone literally leaves the cake out in the rain (\"MacArthur Park\"). As another act performs first (\"Boogie Wonderland\"), the trio gets ready to perform a variety of songs that they sang or lip-synced on their journey (\"The Floor Show\"). Afterwards, Tick finally meets his son, Benji, who accepts his father's sexuality and lifestyle (\"Always on My Mind/I Say a Little Prayer\") and Adam gets to perform his own solo Madonna hit, (\"Like A Prayer\" [Broadway]; \"Confide in Me/Kylie Medley\" [Australia and West End]), his favorite singer. Afterwards the gang talks about their plans after Alice Springs, and realize they can't leave each other (\"We Belong\"). They go off stage together and the company performs a medley of songs to close the show (\"Finally (Finale)\").",

        "synopsis": "### Act l\n\nAt an ice skating rink named \"Skater Planet\" in Bergen County , New Jersey , six teenagers \u2013 Kimberly Levaco, Seth Weetis, Martin Doaty, Aaron Puckett, Teresa Benton, and Delia McDaniels \u2013 express their frustrations. Kim is the new girl in town, with a disease that makes her age four and a half times as fast as normal, and a dream of visiting Six Flags Great Adventure . Seth, an employee at the rink, feels like a misfit. The four others are all pining for another member of their friend group unrequitedly (Martin for Aaron, Aaron for Delia, Delia for Teresa, and Teresa for Martin). All the teens  feel as if they don't fit in, and express their desire to \"be seen\" (\"Skater Planet\"). Kim\u2019s frequently drunk father Buddy is over three hours late picking her up; Kimberly gives him a thermos filled with coffee to sober up. Seth comes back to the rink for his tuba, which he had left inside. He asks Kim to be his partner for an upcoming biology project, and says that they could do it about her disease. Buddy retorts and says that Kimberly is researching glaucoma , and insults Seth behind his back. Buddy tells Kimberly to tell her mother, Pattie, that they were late due to car troubles. At the Levacos\u2019 home, Pattie, pregnant and with casts on both arms, creates a video for her yet-to-be-born baby (\"Hello, Darling\"). When Buddy and Kim arrive home, Pattie chastises Buddy for their lateness and his drunkenness, which leads to an argument in which both parents end up having to give quarters to the family \" swear jar \". Buddy suggests that if they save up enough in the swear jar, they could go on a road trip, which Pattie quickly shoots down. It is also established that the family is trying to keep secret the fact that they're from Lodi, New Jersey . In her room, Kimberly writes a letter to the Make A Wish Foundation , requesting a treehouse after going back and forth between an array of wishes (\"Make A Wish\").\n\nAt school, Martin, Aaron, Delia, and Teresa make plans for a Dreamgirls medley for their school show choir, one that will compete with their rival West Orange's Evita medley. They reaffirm their problems with unrequited love (\"Skater Planet (reprise #1)\"). The group then plans on purchasing classic show choir outfits (blue dresses for the girls and turquoise suits for the boys). Kimberly agrees to be Seth's partner for the biology project, and to use her disease as their topic. Delia invites Teresa to Skater Planet, but Teresa wants to invite Martin. This results in all four members of the friend group agreeing to go to Skater Planet, after Martin invites Aaron. In the library, while studying for their project, Seth creates an anagram of Kim's name, \"Cleverly Akimbo \". She realizes that she likes him (\"Anagram\"). Debra, Kim's criminal aunt, shows up and makes crude jokes. She reveals that she has been sleeping in the school library, waiting to find Kimberly. The Levaco family moved from Lodi in a manner that made it difficult for Debra to find them, which was intentional. Debra tells Kim about an exciting new opportunity to make a lot of money, and that it is only \"slightly illegal\". Debra also tries to convince Martin, Aaron, Delia, and Teresa to help out (\"Better\"). Kim agrees, but only if she gets a say in the plan, and only if Debra agrees that nobody will get hurt. Debra is ecstatic, and tells Kimberly to leave the window and door unlocked at her house.\n\nAround midnight, at the house, Kim goes to unlock the door, but is caught by Pattie, who is awake because of the baby's kicking. Kimberly distracts her, as Debra sneaks in the window. Kim tells her mother that she reminds her of Medea . However, despite Kim's distraction efforts, Pattie catches Debra. Ignoring Pattie's protests, Debra comes into the house, and drags a mailbox into the basement. Pattie reflects on and laments her situation, before singing a lullaby that she used to sing for Kim to the new baby (\"Hello, Darling (reprise)/Father Time\"). At this point, it is Kim's sixteenth birthday. The life expectancy of one with her disease is sixteen years old. The next morning, Buddy is driving Kim and Seth to school, but embarrasses Kim by yelling at Seth for supposedly wanting to \"get in her [Kimberly's] pants\". He also throws Seth's muffin out of the car window (\"Happy For Her\"). Kimberly yells at her father, and tells him that she hopes he crashes the car into a tree and dies. Later, at school, Seth tells Kim that if she wanted him to kiss her, he'd do it. He also invites Kim to come to Skater Planet that night, which she agrees to. Kim reflects on her feelings for Seth (\"Anagram (reprise)\"). That night, at Skater Planet, Seth gives Kimberly a present of a book of anagrams. Pattie, Debra, and Buddy all show up as well, having been invited by Seth, who reveals to Kim that this is a surprise birthday party. Debra gifts Kim an extremely large pinecone, while Buddy and Pattie both promise to, respectively, stop drinking and be a better mother as their presents. Martin, Aaron, Delia, and Teresa arrive, also having been invited to the party. Delia informs the group that they won't be able to get their costumes, because the show choir has run out of money. Hearing this, Debra ropes them into her plan once more. Everybody hopes for the future (\"This Time\").\n\n### Act II\n\nIn Kim\u2019s basement, Debra is teaching the six teenagers how to wash a check . It proves too complex for them, with Aaron getting his arm stuck in the mailbox (from which they are retrieving the checks), and Teresa getting a glue trap stuck to her head (which they are using to fish out the checks). However, once Debra compares them unfavorably to West Orange, they complete the task without trouble (\u201cHow to Wash a Check\u201d). After the rest of the group is gone, Seth stands alone and reflects on how all his life he was the \"good kid\" and now he is involved in a check fraud scheme, before deciding \"maybe a little bad could do a lot of good.\" (\"Good Kid\")\n\nAt the Levaco home, Buddy is trying to distract himself, since he is not drinking, through an exercise plan he and Kim came up with. When Pattie, now with a leg brace from a skating injury at Kimberly\u2019s birthday party, leaves her camera in the room, he makes a video for the baby. He reflects on the future that he lost when Pattie got pregnant with Kim, and tells the baby to \u201csee the world\u201d (\u201cHello, Baby\u201d). At school, the six teens are in the library, playing UNO , just before their biology class (and their biology presentations). Seth asks about what will happen if they get caught, and all of them think about what the future holds (\u201cSkater Planet (reprise #2)\u201d). In class, the group does their presentations. Aaron and Martin present scurvy , Delia and Teresa present fasciolosis , and Kim and Seth present her disease. During the presentation, Kimberly gets upset, thinking about how getting older is her affliction, but getting older is the rest of the class\u2019s cure (for adolescence). She runs out of the class (\u201cOur Disease\u201d).\n\nWhen Kim arrives at home, she finds that Buddy has cooked a meal for everybody, and they sit down for a family dinner. However, resentment soon boils over, and they begin to fight. It is revealed that Buddy paid Debra to go to the Levaco\u2019s old neighbor, Mr. Zwicky\u2019s house to beat him up, because Pattie had sex with him to ensure that this baby wouldn\u2019t have the same ailment as Kim. Zwicky died of a fear-induced heart attack during the assault, resulting in the family leaving Lodi. They fight, until Kimberly collapses to the floor (\u201cThe Inevitable Turn\u201d). Three days later, at the hospital, Kim is bedridden and asleep. Debra convinces Buddy and Pattie to leave and go home, so they can sleep and take showers. Before they leave, Pattie tells Kim (who is pretending to sleep) that the Make A Wish Foundation is going to build her a treehouse. Seth shows up, while Debra takes off to find a bedpan and pills. Seth has brought all sorts of things to help Kim feel better, but she just wants to live in a better moment and they decide to leave to participate in the check fraud scheme, which was to be done without them (\u201cNow\u201d).\n\nDebra reminds the group of their plan (\u201cHow to Wash a Check (reprise)\u201d). She also reveals the kids' crushes on one another. Kim emerges from the back room disguised as a grandmother, which is a part of the plan. She demands that Martin, Aaron, Delia, Teresa, and Seth not come along, but Seth insists (he is also the one driving). They go. Later, Kim comes home with a bag of the money and tells her parents that they can finally go on their road trip, and to start packing. She then goes into her room, and sees that they have replaced her bed with a crib for the new baby. They fight, and she tells her parents to give up who they wanted her to be before she dies. She writes a new letter to Make A Wish, telling them thank you for the treehouse, but that she doesn\u2019t need it because she is going to see the world (\u201cBefore I Go\u201d).\n\nKimberly and Seth are in Buddy\u2019s car, at Six Flags Great Adventure. They are on a road trip, with the camera and their portion of the money\u2013as well as Debra\u2019s money, which they stole. Kim makes a video for her sister and asks Seth to make sure she gets it (\u201cHello, Sister\u201d). They kiss.\n\nMartin, Aaron, Delia, and Teresa (in their show choir outfits), Debra (now working at Costco), Pattie and Buddy (with the new baby), and Kim and Seth tell the audience to live life to the fullest because \"no one gets a second time around\" (\u201cGreat Adventure\u201d).",

Tensions arise as Walter tries to convince Mama Lena to forget her dream of buying the family its own small house (\"A Whole Lotta Sunlight\").\n\nWalter decides to make the deal for the liquor store and signs the papers with his partners Bobo Jones and Willie Harris.

He takes the gifts to Nadine, who has been offered the opportunity to star in a show\u2014solo. He tries to persuade her to stay with him (\"It Only Happens When I Dance with You\"), but she has signed a contract. Don's best friend, Johnny, arrives. Nadine is clearly attracted to Johnny, but he resists her out of respect for Don.\n\nDon drowns his sorrows at the bar at Pastini's restaurant, bragging to Johnny and the bartender, Mike, that he can replace Nadine with any girl from the floor show. He randomly chooses Hannah Brown. The next day at rehearsal, he learns that she suffers from left\u2013right confusion . Determined to turn Hannah into a star, Don buys her a new wardrobe and gives her the exotic stage name \"Juanita\". She makes several mistakes at their first performance (\"Beautiful Faces Need Beautiful Clothes\"), and the show is a fiasco.\n\nJohnny unsuccessfully tries to reunite Don with Nadine, who confronts Don about trying to turn Hannah into a copy of her. Later, Johnny meets Hannah by chance and walks her to rehearsal during a rainstorm (\"A Fella with an Umbrella\"). Realizing he has been taking the wrong approach with Hannah, Don prepares routines better suited to her. Now known as \"Hannah & Hewes\", they become a great success (\" I Love a Piano \", \"Snookie-Ookums\", \"The Ragtime Violin\", and \"When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves for Alabam'\").\n\nAuditioning for the Ziegfeld Follies , Don and Hannah meet the show's star\u2014Nadine. Realizing that Nadine is Don's former partner, Hannah demands to know whether he loved her. At Hannah's hotel room, Don reveals that he turned down the Ziegfeld offer, believing that Hannah is too good to be in the same show as Nadine. They are about to kiss when Johnny arrives to take Hannah to dinner. He confesses that he fell in love with her during the rainstorm, but Hannah admits that she is hopelessly in love with Don.\n\nAfter watching Nadine's show (\"Shakin' the Blues Away\"), Don tells Hannah that he has signed them to star in their own show and invites her out on the town to celebrate. She arrives at his apartment to find that he has arranged a private dinner. When Don begins to discuss their act, Hannah accuses him of treating their rendezvous like a dance rehearsal. She tries to leave, but he kisses her. She plays the piano and sings \"It Only Happens When I Dance with You\". \"Why didn't you tell me I was in love with you?\" he asks, and they embrace.\n\nTheir show features Don and a large chorus (\" Steppin' Out with My Baby \") before he and Hannah play tramps (\" A Couple of Swells \").

The next morning, Johnny visits Hannah and claims that Don is already auditioning a new partner, compelling her to admit that she loves Don. Johnny remarks that if he loved someone, he would find a way to show them.\n\nFlowers, a chocolate egg, and a live bunny inside a top hat are anonymously delivered to Don's apartment.

Smith , John E. Hazzard, Ring Lardner and Jerome Kern , and additional music by Henry Kailimai . The story was based on the farce Over Night by Bartholomae. The farcical plot concerns three couples and a sex-crazed voice teacher who board a Hudson River Day Line boat in Poughkeepsie , New York. Chaos ensues when two of the couples cross paths and accidentally trade partners. The vaudeville -style adventure continues at a hotel, where guests pop in and out of rooms while an inebriated desk clerk tries to sort through the madness.\n\nThe show was the second of the series of \"Princess Theatre musicals\" and was a hit for Bolton and Kern, running for 341 performances and leading to revivals and further successful collaborations.",
        "synopsis": "Note: This is a synopsis of the original 1915 Libretto. Alterations were made and many songs were added for the 1975 revival version.\n\n### Act I\n\nThe Hudson River Day Line boat \"The Catskill\" is under way on a summer day (\u201cWe\u2019re on Our Way\u201d). The boat stops for fifteen minutes at Poughkeepsie , New York. Dick Rivers comes aboard and tells Victoria Lake and the girls that he has fallen in love with Elsie Lilly, the star pupil of the great voice teacher Madame Matroppo (\u201cThe Same Old Game\u201d). To be alone with Elsie, he persuades Madame Matroppo to let him interview her pupil for a magazine article. Elsie is not easily wooed. She tells Dick that she used to be engaged to a man named Eddie. She has heard that Dick is always in love with the next girl he meets (\u201cSome Sort of Somebody\u201d).\n\nAfter some arguing, newlyweds Eddie and Georgina Kettle board the boat. Eddie is much smaller than Georgina and she treats him like an infant. Georgina asks Eddie if he has been in love before her, and he says he used to have an affair with a girl named Elsie. Then two other honeymooners, Percy and Elsie Darling enter. In this relationship, Percy belittles Elsie. As the couples run into each other, Eddie and Percy turn out to be college friends. The couples rejoice (\u201cIsn't it Great to Be Married\u201d).\n\nGeorgina and Percy get off the boat and leave Eddie and Elsie Darling behind. Georgina has to find Eddie's missing luggage, and Percy needs to send a telegram. The boat suddenly leaves, and Eddie and Elsie have no idea what to do without their partners. They decide to get off at the next stop and attempt to make their way back to their partners. When they decide to eat, they realize they don't have any money. Eddie sees his acquaintance Dick Rivers and decides to ask him for some money. Eddie pretends that Elsie Darling is his bride so that Dick will give him 20 dollars as a honeymoon gift. Dick tells him about his newfound love, Elsie Lilly and that she is on the boat as well. He does not realize that Eddie and Elsie Lilly are old lovers. Dick leaves, and Eddie and Elsie Darling sit down to eat. Elsie encourages Eddie to have a martini, and he immediately feels drunk. Dick returns with Madama Matroppo and introduces her to the \"newlyweds\". Eddie orders champagne for everyone as they celebrate (\u201cWedding Bells Are Calling Me\u201d).\n\n### Act II\n\nAt the Rip Van Winkle Inn, it is evening (\u201cOn the Beach of Li-Li-Wee\u201d). Eddie and Elsie Darling realize that there is no return boat or train until the next day. They get two separate rooms at the Inn. Eddie must use Percy's luggage since he left his own suitcase back in Poughkeepsie. He spills rice out of Percy's suitcase, and the drunken desk clerk thinks that the pair are married. This means they must register as husband and wife. Elsie convinces Eddie that he must destroy the register, since it could be used as evidence to request a divorce. Madame Matroppo enters and informs Eddie that Elsie Lilly and Dick are also staying at the Inn. The clerk guides Eddie and Elsie Darling to their rooms. Dick enters and expresses his confusion about Eddie's behavior towards his \u201cwife\u201d to Madame Matroppo (\u201cIf I Find the Girl\u201d). Eddie leaves his room and secretly spills ink on the register to cover his name. Madame Matroppo is looking for her French admirer when she runs into the clerk who expresses his love for her (\u201cThe Triangle\u201d). Eddie invites Elsie Darling for dinner downstairs, but she declines. Eddie meets Madame Matroppo at dinner but she refuses to sit with him and says he must go upstairs to dine with his \"wife\". Eddie laments his size and his low status (\u201cWhen Your Collar Is No. 13 and Your Shoes No. 3\u201d).\n\nDick finally runs into Elsie Lilly and confesses his love for her. She tells him she doesn't want to settle down, but he tells her that he doesn't want to either (\u201cOld Boy Neutral\u201d). Georgina and Percy arrive at the Inn but they can't be sure whether Eddie and Elsie Darling are guests because the register is ruined. It is late so they decide to stay at the Inn as well. To the surprise of the clerk they also get two separate rooms. Georgina learns that Percy's wife is named Elsie and comes to the unsettling conclusion that she must be the same Elsie that Eddie loved long ago. Unhappily they both go to bed. Meanwhile, Elsie Darling knocks on Eddie's door because she is afraid a mouse is in her room. He comforts her and tells her to be brave (\u201cBabes in the Wood\u201d).\n\nThe next morning Elsie Lilly finds out that Dick got her red roses all the way from New York. Victoria Lake and her girls sing (\u201cThe Fashion Show\u201d). Dick meets Percy and Georgina and informs them that the \"newlyweds\" Eddie and Elsie Darling are at the Inn. He tells them how they had cocktails on the boat; Percy and Georgina are shocked and angry. The clerk informs Madame Matroppo that he has to sing in a minute, and he needs a last minute voice lesson. She decides to hypnotize him, and he tells her he used to be a cashier in a police station. He fantasizes about money and having someone to share it with (\u201cI\u2019d Like to Have a Million in the Bank\u201d).\n\nEddie bought a few left over roses from Dick and knocks on Elsie Darling's door to give them to her. She starts crying when she sees him in Percy's pajamas. Elsie Lilly and Dick enter and once again he confesses his love for her. This time she accepts it (\u201cHolding Roses\u201d). Eddie tells Elsie Darling that Madame Matroppo is suspicious of their \u201cmarriage\u201d so they decide to speak very lovingly to each other in the hope that she can hear them. Unfortunately, Percy and Georgina hear them and angrily confront them. But Eddie and Elsie Darling have learned how to handle themselves. Eddie explains the facts, and both of them finally stand up to their partners. Eddie orders Georgina to sit down, and she does. The delighted clerk shouts admiringly, \"Very Good, Eddie!\u201d (\u201cFinale\u201d).",

It is a modern retelling of the lives of the six wives of Henry VIII , presented in the form of a singing competition/pop concert. In the show, the wives take turns telling their stories to determine who suffered the most from their shared husband, but ultimately seek to reclaim their individual identities and rewrite their stories.\n\nThe musical premiered at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2017, where it was performed by students from Cambridge University . Six premiered in the West End at the Arts Theatre in January 2019, and has since embarked on a UK tour. It premiered in North America in May 2019 and on Broadway in February 2020. Following a hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic , it officially opened at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on 3 October 2021 and has since launched additional touring companies.\n\nA filmed stage production titled SIX The Musical Live! , featuring the original West End cast, was released in UK & Ireland cinemas by Universal Pictures on 6 April 2025. An international release date is set to be announced.",
        "synopsis": "The six queens consort introduce themselves through biographical pop songs and explain that their band's lead singer will be whoever they determine had the worst experience at the hands of their shared ex-husband, Henry VIII (\"Ex-Wives\"). Catherine of Aragon recounts how Henry wished to annul their marriage and place her in a nunnery when he began pursuing Anne Boleyn , despite her loyalty to him (\"No Way\"). The queens introduce Anne Boleyn (\"The One You've Been Waiting For\"), who boasts about how Henry wanted her instead of Catherine, but then complains of Henry's infidelity , which led to Anne's own flirtations with other men, which were the grounds for her beheading (\"Don't Lose Ur Head\"). Jane Seymour steps up to take her turn, but is ridiculed for having had an easy time with Henry. However, while admitting she may have been the only wife Henry truly loved, Jane claims that Henry's love was conditional, only guaranteed because she produced a male heir , and that she stood by him despite his many faults (\"Heart of Stone\").\n\nThemes relating to ideas of female beauty and the sacrifices expected are explored in Hans Holbein 's portrait studio. The queens parody a dating app by presenting a choice of potential brides (\"Haus of Holbein\"). Henry chooses Anna of Cleves for his fourth wife, but soon rejects her and annuls the marriage, claiming she failed to resemble her \"profile picture\". She makes a show of complaining about living in a palace in Richmond with an enormous fortune and no husband telling her what to do but ends up bragging about her life instead (\"Get Down\"). The other queens question this, and Anna admits her lavish lifestyle lacked actual tragedy then drops out of the competition. The queens next mock Katherine Howard claiming she's \"the least relevant Catherine,\" but in retaliation she exposes flaws in the others' claims to winning. Katherine recounts her romantic history, having had many suitors even as a child, and at first relishes her attractiveness before later revealing the emotional trauma and sexual abuse she faced in each of these relationships (\"All You Wanna Do\").\n\nAs the queens continue to fight over who the true winner is, the final wife, Catherine Parr , questions the point of the competition, which defines them by their connection to Henry rather than as individuals. They nonetheless continue to argue. Frustrated, Parr details her separation from her lover, Sir Thomas Seymour , and arranged marriage to Henry; however, instead of simply complaining about her situation, she acknowledges her accomplishments independent of Henry (\"I Don't Need Your Love\"). The other queens, realizing they have been robbed of their individuality, abandon the contest and declare that they don't need Henry's love to feel validated as people (\"I Don't Need Your Love (Remix)\"). They use their remaining moments onstage to rewrite their stories, singing together as a group rather than as solo artists, and writing their own ' happily ever afters ', imagining that Henry had never married them (\"Six\"). They then perform a mashup of the main songs that appeared earlier in the show (\"The Megasix\").",

        "synopsis": "In Calatonia, a city of anthropomorphic animals, koala Buster Moon owns a struggling theater, and is threatened with foreclosure by bank representative llama Judith. He decides to hold a singing competition with a prize of $1,000, but a typo made by his elderly assistant iguana Miss Crawly adds two extra zeros to the prize money, making it $100,000. The misprinted flyers are blown out of the window by a fan before they can be proofread, and float across the city.\n\nCrowds of animals gather to audition, and Buster selects his contestants. Among them are housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita; punk-rock porcupine Ash; teenage gorilla Johnny, son of a criminal gang leader named Big Daddy; street musician mouse Mike; and an exuberant dancing pig named Gunter. Teenage elephant Meena fails her audition due to stage fright , Ash's self-absorbed boyfriend and co-auditionee Lance is upset to be dismissed from the contest, and Rosita is paired with Gunter for a dance routine. After Buster discovers the flyers advertise a prize of $100,000, he joins his friend sheep Eddie on a visit to Eddie's wealthy grandmother, former theater superstar Nana Noodleman. Nana is reluctant to sponsor the prize money, but agrees to attend a private preview of the show before making a decision.\n\nPressured by her grandfather, Meena attempts to request a second audition, but settles for being Buster's stagehand instead. After some acts withdraw from the competition, Meena is offered a spot in the show, but again struggles to overcome her fear. Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter, believing her motherly duties have caused her to lose her passion. Mike, assuming he will win the competition, takes out a massive loan from the bank to buy a flashy car and swindles a group of bears in a card game. Lance cheats on Ash, causing her to break up with him, and later to break down crying during a rehearsal. Johnny, forced by his father to partake in a heist as a getaway driver, sneaks away to the rehearsal. Traffic prevents Johnny from returning to the heist in time, resulting in his father and his gang getting arrested and incarcerated, straining their relationship. After an accident causes stage lights to fall and break, Buster has the stage rebuilt as a tank so luminescent squids can be used as lights.\n\nDesperate, Johnny attempts to steal the prize money for his father's bail, but when he sees a note on Buster's desk praising his talents, Johnny resolves to focus on his musical career instead. Meanwhile, Rosita regains her passion for dancing while grocery shopping, and Ash composes a song that Buster likes. On the day of the preview for Nana, the bears Mike had cheated locate him, and demand their money back. Mike directs them to Buster; the bears break open the prize chest, but it is nowhere near $100,000. Shocked by the lack of money, the rest of the contestants question Buster, and the squid tank shatters under everyone's weight. The flooded theater implodes, and Judith repossesses the lot. A disheartened Buster takes up residence with Eddie and supports himself by washing cars.\n\nMeena goes to the rubble of the theater and sings out loud to music on her headphones, inspiring Buster to stage an outdoor show. Despite attempts from Judith to halt the show, it takes place on the lot of the former theater with Meena's and Rosita's families in attendance. More animals are drawn into the audience when the show is broadcast live on the local news. Rosita's husband Norman is roused by his wife's talent, Big Daddy breaks out of prison and travels to the lot to reconcile with Johnny, Lance is impressed by Ash's original rock song \"Set It All Free\", the bears find Mike and chase him away, and Meena overcomes her stage fright and gives an enthusiastic performance. The show is a success and impresses Nana, who was in the audience. She purchases the lot, and the theater is rebuilt and reopened.",

This was the first Lloyd Webber and Rice musical to be performed publicly; their first collaboration, The Likes of Us , written in 1965, was not performed until 2005. Its family-friendly retelling of Joseph, familiar themes, and catchy music have resulted in numerous stagings. According to the owner of the copyright, the Really Useful Group , by 2008 more than 20,000 schools and amateur theatre groups had staged productions.\n\nJoseph was first presented as a 15-minute \" pop cantata \" at Colet Court School in London in 1968, and was published by Novello and recorded in an expanded form by Decca Records in 1969. After the success of the next Lloyd Webber and Rice piece, Jesus Christ Superstar , Joseph received amateur stage productions in the US beginning in 1970, and the first American release of the album was in 1971. The musical had its professional premiere, as a 35-minute musical, at the Haymarket ice rink during the Edinburgh International Festival in 1972. It was Part Two of Bible One , a Young Vic Theatre Company production presented by the National Theatre of Great Britain. While still undergoing various modifications and expansions, the musical was produced in the West End in 1973. In 1974, its full modern format was performed at the Haymarket Theatre in Leicester and was also recorded that year. The musical was mounted on Broadway in 1982. Several major revivals, national tours, and a 1999 direct-to-video film starring Donny Osmond followed.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nJoseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat is based on the story of Joseph from the Book of Genesis.\n\nA Narrator opens the show by introducing Joseph, the dreamer (\"Prologue\"). Joseph sings an inspiring song to the audience (\" Any Dream Will Do \"). The Narrator then draws the audience's attention to Joseph's father Jacob and his 12 sons (\"Jacob and Sons\"). Jacob favours Joseph over his other sons, and he gives Joseph a multicoloured coat to show his affection for him. Joseph is ecstatic about this gift (\"Joseph's Coat\"), while his brothers look on with jealousy.\n\nThe brothers\u2019 jealousy is compounded by Joseph's dreams, which suggest that he is destined to rule over them (\"Joseph's Dreams\"). To stop this from happening, they try to kill him by throwing him down a pit, before changing their minds and selling him as a slave to some passing Ishmaelites . The Narrator comments on how powerless Joseph was to stop this (\"Poor, Poor Joseph\").\n\nTo hide what they have done, Joseph's brothers and their wives tell Jacob that his beloved son has been killed. As proof, they show him Joseph's coat, which they have torn to pieces and covered in goat's blood (\"One More Angel in Heaven\"). When the devastated Jacob exits, the brothers and wives cheerfully celebrate Joseph's departure (\"Hoedown\").\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph is taken to Egypt, where he is bought as a slave by the wealthy Potiphar. He works hard and is promoted, eventually running the household. Joseph catches the eye of Mrs Potiphar and although he turns down her advances, Potiphar sees them together and jumps to the wrong conclusion (\"Potiphar\"). Enraged, he throws Joseph in jail.\n\nA heartbroken Joseph laments his situation (\" Close Every Door \"). Two prisoners, both former servants of the Pharaoh, are put in his cell. Joseph interprets their strange dreams and predicts the butler will return to Pharaoh's service, while the baker will be executed. As Joseph questions his predictions, the other prisoners encourage Joseph to follow his own dreams (\"Go, Go Joseph\").\n\n### Act II\n\nThe Narrator opens the second act with news that the Egyptian populace has been plagued by dreams that no one can interpret (\"Pharaoh Story\"). The butler, now freed and again serving Pharaoh, tells him of Joseph's skill at deciphering dreams (\"Poor, Poor Pharaoh\"). Pharaoh has Joseph brought to him and describes his dreams, one involving seven fat cows, being devoured by seven skinny cows, and another about seven healthy ears of corn, similarly being devoured by seven withered ears of corn (\"Song of the King\").\n\nJoseph declares that Egypt will see seven years of plentiful harvests, followed by an equal period of severe famine, and that Pharaoh must select a man to help Egypt prepare for the famine (\"Pharaoh's Dreams Explained\"). Impressed with what he hears, Pharaoh pardons and frees Joseph, makes him his second-in-command, and puts him in charge of famine preparations. As the seven plentiful years end, and the seven years of famine begins, Egypt, under Joseph's leadership, manages to persevere (\"Stone the Crows\").\n\nMeanwhile, Joseph's family back home is now starving and poor, having lost their farm and living off scraps in a brothel. Joseph's brothers regret what they did to him and how they lied to their father, thinking that things might have turned out differently if Joseph was still with them (\"Those Canaan Days\"). Hearing that Egypt still has food, they travel there to beg for supplies (\"The Brothers Come to Egypt\").\n\nIn Egypt, the brothers beg for food from Joseph, not recognizing him, and Joseph realizes that as the brothers bow before him this is the dream he had years ago coming true. He initially suggests the brothers might be spies, but they sincerely insist they're struggling (\"Grovel, Grovel\"). Joseph gives them sacks of food, but plants a golden cup in the one belonging to Benjamin, his youngest brother. When the brothers attempt to depart, Joseph stops them, accusing them of theft. Each brother empties his sack (\"Who's the Thief?\"), and when the cup is found in Benjamin's sack Joseph accuses him of stealing. The other brothers beg Joseph to take them prisoner instead and let Benjamin go free (\"Benjamin Calypso\").\n\nJoseph sees that his brothers have changed and reveals who he really is (\"Joseph All the Time\"), then sends for Jacob (\"Jacob in Egypt\"). Upon meeting Jacob for the first time in years, Joseph sings \"Any Dream Will Do\" again, and the lyrics are revealed to be a vague overview of the story. Jacob returns Joseph's coat to him, now fully repaired (\"Give Me My Coloured Coat\")\n\nIn some productions, the cast perform a medley of songs from the show as they take their bows (\"Joseph Megamix\").",

        "synopsis": "The story follows the life of Fiorello H. La Guardia during World War I and ten years later. As Mayor of New York City La Guardia reforms city politics by helping end Tammany Hall 's vaunted political machine.\n\n### Act I\n\nMayor Fiorello H. La Guardia is reading the comics over the radio because there is a newspaper strike. As he does so, the time changes to 1915 and the law office where clients are eagerly waiting to speak to La Guardia. His law clerks assure the crowd that he will help one and all, regardless of their ability to pay (\"On the Side of the Angels\"). Fiorello's secretary Marie and her friend Dora discuss a crisis. Thea Almerigatti, the leader of the women shirtwaist strikers, has been arrested. La Guardia promises to help the strikers. As the district leader Ben and his political buddies play poker (\"Politics and Poker\"), Marie introduces La Guardia as a potential Congressional candidate. They want to beat the corrupt machine of Tammany Hall.\n\nWhile helping the women strikers (\"Unfair\"), Fiorello asks Marie to dinner, but Thea, newly released from prison,  arrives. She asks Fiorello to dinner to plan strategy, and he breaks his date with Marie. Marie feels foolish for caring while he cares so little (\"Marie's Law\").\n\nNext year, Fiorello is campaigning for Congress, and Thea introduces him. Fiorello promises to break the stranglehold of Tammany Hall (\"The Name's La Guardia!\"). La Guardia wins the election (\"The Bum Won\"). In another year, La Guardia enlists in the Air Force and proposes to Thea. He and Marie say their farewells as he is about to leave for the war (\"Till Tomorrow\"). La Guardia's participation in the war is presented as a series of montages, staged and on film. With the war over, Fiorello returns home (\"Home Again\"), with both Marie and Thea waiting for him. He goes to Thea, who has agreed to marriage. Morris, the office manager, comforts Marie.\n\n### Act II\n\nIn 1929, La Guardia runs for mayor of New York, after he and Thea are married. Thea, home from a visit to the doctor, exclaims her love (\"When Did I Fall In Love\"). At Dora and her husband Floyd's (who has retired from the police force) home, the corrupt backers of Jimmy Walker , Fiorello's competitor for mayor, meet. As one of the gang wants to have Fiorello killed at his public speech, Dora rushes to secretly warn Marie. However, Fiorello's campaign is in turmoil, with Ben being fired and his worry over Thea's deteriorating health. At La Guardia's speech the gang's plan to kill him is foiled. But Thea dies, and Marie, Morris, and Neil have to tell Fiorello. The race for mayor is won by Jimmy Walker. Fiorello is inspired by tragedy to continue his campaign.\n\nIn 1933, Ben and his political friends are again playing poker (\"Little Tin Box\"). Marie arrives and announces that she is quitting her job and will marry \"The Very Next Man\" who asks her. She convinces Ben to return to Fiorello to help him win the upcoming mayoral election. She then helps Fiorello to overcome his fears of losing and run again. He runs with Ben's help, and also asks Marie to marry him. She accepts and Fiorello finally becomes the mayor.",

The story was adapted from parts of the 1913-1927 seven-volume novel In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust . It ran Off-Broadway in 2003.\n\nThe musical is set in a salle du th\u00e9\u00e2tre (private theatre in a home) in Paris, 1919. For much of the story, the Narrator stands beside a piano and speaks to the audience, as the curtain opens to reveal scenes from his life.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nA young woman, Albertine, emerges through the curtain holding a letter, which she shares with the audience (\"Is It Too Late?\"). At its conclusion, the Narrator reveals, \"That is the end. I will begin at the beginning \u2014 of my life with Albertine.\"\n\nMarcel first met Albertine in a seaside village during the summer of 1898 (\"Balbec-by-the-Sea\"). He was only seventeen years old and immediately bewitched by her. Albertine is unlike anyone Marcel has ever encountered. With a black polo-cap pulled down over her forehead, she pushes along a bicycle and swinging her hips confidently. That night, unable to sleep, Marcel begs his Grandmother, with whom he is especially close, to sing him to sleep as she did when he was a child (\"Lullaby\"). A friend later tells him more about Albertine. She is an orphaned, middle-class girl who lives with her aunt. Intrigued, Marcel follows her down a path to the woods. At first spying on her, he eventually comes out and joins Albertine and her girlfriends in a game (\"Ferret Song\"). At the end of the summer, Albertine invites him to her hotel room, where he finds her alone and in her nightclothes. She shares with him a passionate poem she has been reading (\"My Soul Weeps\"), but when he tries to kiss her, she has him thrown out.\n\nBack in Paris, Marcel's Grandmother dies. Feeling alone and adrift, Marcel begins to aimlessly attend adult \"society\" (\"Talk About the Weather\") while also trying to compose at the piano. One day Albertine suddenly arrives at his door. Now she allows \u2014 even encourages \u2014 his advances, and soon she sleeps with him, while the Narrator looks on (\"The Different Albertines\"). Having gotten what he wanted, Marcel breaks off the affair.\n\nThe following summer, Marcel avoids Albertine (\"Sad Balbec\"). He visits a seedy nightclub (\"My Soul Weeps\" \u2014 Tango) and discovers her dancing closely with another girl. Confused and excited, Marcel invites Albertine to tea at his hotel where they happen across a lesbian couple. Albertine assures him that she is not \"that type\" and after some hesitation, he believes her. Searching for words to express his feelings, Marcel asks the Narrator for help (\"But What I Say\"). Act I finishes as the Narrator closes the stage curtain and stands alone (\"Song of Solitude\")\n\n### Act II\n\nMarcel, Albertine and her friend Andr\u00e9e visit an outdoor cabaret together featuring Mademoiselle Lea, a well-known lesbian singer (\"I Want You\"). To Marcel's dismay, Albertine is already acquainted with Lea and is cajoled to offer her own recital (\"I Need Me a Girl\"). Consumed with jealousy, Marcel takes Albertine back with him to Paris, where he locks her in his apartment. Trying to work, he is distracted by the nearly-nude Albertine as she sleeps on the sofa. When she wakes, the Narrator, Marcel and Albertine again find themselves at a loss for words (\"But What I Say\" \u2014 Reprise). As Albertine runs off to take a bath, Marcel and the Narrator imagine their worst fears coming to life (\"Sometimes\").\n\nWith Albertine out at the theatre, the cries of street vendors inspire Marcel to compose, but his work unravels as his obsession grows (\"The Street\"). That night, after an argument, Marcel and the Narrator reach a decision, but before he can tell Albertine that she must leave, his maid Fran\u00e7oise informs him that she has gone. Even with her departure, the war between the two Marcels and Albertine continues to escalate (\"The Letters\"), but a broken Marcel halts it by scribbling out a telegram begging her to return on any terms. Before he can send it, a messenger appears with news of her death.\n\nOne more letter from Albertine arrives in the morning mail. Marcel opens it and reads as the Narrator goes to the piano and takes out the \"real\" letter. It is aged, creased and stained (\"Albertine's Last Letter\"). Curtain.\n\nWith his story finished, the Narrator adds that there is one song that did not fit anywhere into his story, so he has put it here. He summons back Albertine to perform a simple, pure, straightforward love song (\"If It Is True\") \u2014 everything that Marcel and the Narrator have been seeking and never found. The End.",

Valentine strikes out on his own, arriving first; he falls in love with Sylvia, and makes plans to win her hand. However, her father, the Duke of Milan, has betrothed her to the wealthy but undesirable Thurio. Antonio, a Veronese nobleman, then decides to send his son Proteus to the Duke's court in Milan, to experience a more well-rounded life. After his arrival in Milan, Proteus also sets his sights on Sylvia, disregarding his loyalty to both Valentine and Julia (his sweetheart back home). Valentine admits his own plans to elope with Sylvia. Proteus tells the Duke of their plans, gaining favor for himself - and causing Valentine's banishment from the court. Meanwhile, in Verona, Julia asks her maid Lucetta for help in deciding upon which of the two she should fall in love with. Julia disguises herself as a page named Sebastian so she can travel to Milan - accompanied by Lucetta, in the male guise of Caesario - to be reunited with Proteus. After arriving at court, she witnesses Proteus and Thurio wooing Silvia.\n\nWhile traveling to Mantua , the exiled Valentine is kidnapped by outlaws, who have been banished also. They demand that Valentine become their king, but if he refuses, they intend to kill him; Valentine accepts. In Milan, Julia (disguised as Sebastian) delivers to Silvia the ring Proteus gave her, on his behalf (not realizing the page was actually his Veronese girlfriend). Silvia enlists her friend Sir Eglamour to help her escape her betrothal to Thurio, and to find Valentine instead. However, while traveling through the forest, they are overtaken by a band of outlaws. Eglamour runs away, leaving Silvia to fend for herself.\n\nBy then, the Duke, Proteus, and Thurio, along with the disguised Julia, organize a search party for Silvia. Proteus wrests Silvia away from the outlaws. Proteus demands that Silvia give him some sign of her favor for freeing her, but she refuses. He tries to rape her, but the hidden Valentine emerges and stops him. Proteus apologizes, and Valentine offers to give him Silvia as a token of their friendship. \"Sebastian\" (Julia) faints, revealing her true identity. Proteus decides he really loves Julia more than Silvia, taking her instead. The Duke realizes that Thurio is a thug, and recognizes Valentine is much nobler and should marry Silvia. Valentine asks for clemency for the outlaws, and suggests that his marriage to Silvia and Proteus' marriage to Julia should take place on the same day.",

After being refused at another audition, the Mob visits a club where they are noticed and challenged to a dance battle by another crew, the Grim Knights.\n\nThe Grim Knights win the battle and the Mob decides to pack up and leave Los Angeles and return to Miami.

He realizes that he has been selfish and made a lot of mistakes; he apologizes to the Mob and later makes up with Andie and the LMNTRIX.\n\nMoose goes home and finds Camille on their patio, where she reveals that she wasn't actually upset at him, but was jealous when she saw his dancing and realized that she hasn't committed herself to it, despite being a talented dancer; they later make up.\n\nChad and Jenny Kido overhear Alexxa Brava, the host of The Vortex , and Jasper, the leader of the Grim Knights, making out, realizing that Alexxa is rigging the competition.

They introduce the audience to Maizy and Beau, a couple who are planning their wedding (\"Corn\").\n\nWhile Beau's brother, Peanut, is officiating the wedding, the town's corn suddenly begins to die. The town decides that they can't have a wedding until they fix the corn. Maizy talks to her cousin, Lulu, and her grandfather, before discussing the situation with Beau. Maizy tells Beau that she wants to leave the town in order to find solutions, but Beau is against the idea. Maizy explains her reasoning, before booking a plane to Tampa (\"Walls\"). Maizy is amazed by Tampa, and she finds a podiatrist who calls himself a \"corn doctor\". Unaware of what that actually means, she decides to meet the doctor, a man named Gordy (\"Travelin' Song\").\n\nGordy comes from a family of conmen, but is not great at the job (\"Bad\"); currently, he is in debt to some members of the mob (played by the storytellers). Gordy notices a bracelet that Maizy is wearing, which he takes to have appraised by the jewelers (also played by the storytellers), who say that the stones are incredibly valuable. Gordy realizes he can use the bracelet to get out of his debt. He tries to charm Maizy, and Maizy kisses him. Although shocked by her eagerness to cheat on Beau, she delights in her ability to save the corn (\"Woman of the World\").\n\nMaizy takes Gordy back to Cob County, where Beau is angered at her decision to go to Tampa. Maizy retorts that Beau is jealous that she managed to do something about their situation, whereas Beau couldn't even leave the county. As the fight gets increasingly heated, Maizy admits that she kissed Gordy. Beau is shocked and angered, and breaks off his engagement with Maizy, deciding that he's going to find someone who wants him (\"Somebody Will\").\n\nAt Lulu's whiskey distillery, Maizy vents about the situation. Lulu tells her that her mistake was telling Beau that she kissed Gordy. Gordy arrives and tries to sweet-talk Lulu, but Lulu ignores him, relishing her independence as a single person (\"Independently Owned\").\n\nGordy receives two calls from the jewelers and the mob. The jewelers tell him the stones weren't as valuable as they thought, while the members of the mob tell Gordy his debt has been cleared due to the mobster being killed by \"Murry the Mohel\". However, Gordy misunderstands both calls, due to the poor cell service in Cob County. Peanut, Beau, and Lulu overhear the conversations, and go to warn Maizy (\"Holy Shit\"). However, Maizy remains optimistic and doesn't believe the other three. She and Lulu get into an argument, leading to Maizy saying that Lulu's whiskey is bitter. After they leave, Maizy wonders what love means (\"Maybe Love\").\n\nGordy reveals a healthy ear of corn to the town. He tells them that the stones from the bracelet are stopping the corn from growing, and to fix the situation he will remove the stones from the county; he actually intends to keep the stones for himself. The rest of the town takes this as an answer, except for Beau, Lulu, and Peanut. Maizy, still frustrated with Beau and Lulu, and excited by her ability to save the corn, misinterprets Gordy being down on one knee, and agrees to marry him, to the surprise of everyone in Cob County (\"Corn (Reprise)\").\n\n### Act Two\n\nThe storytellers briefly recap the events of Act I. The town goes into a song about how they're Christian , but they drink alcohol (\"We Love Jesus\") (in the North American tour version, the town goes into a song about the purple rocks (\"Ballad of the Rocks\")). Peanut and Beau watch the celebration, and Peanut asks Beau if he's doing all right. Beau says he's fine, but admits his heartache after Peanut leaves (\"OK\").\n\nAs Gordy tries to leave Cob County with the stones, he runs into Lulu. Gordy attempts to charm Lulu, again, and Lulu is interested in Gordy's advances.

It stars Alan Alda , Allen, Drew Barrymore , Lukas Haas , Goldie Hawn , Gaby Hoffmann , Natasha Lyonne , Edward Norton , Natalie Portman , Julia Roberts , Tim Roth , and David Ogden Stiers . Set in New York City, Venice, and Paris, it features singing by actors not usually known for musical roles. The film was a box-office bomb , but is among the more critically successful of Allen's films, with Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert even ranking it as one of Allen's best.\n\nThe emotions of an extended upper-class family in Manhattan are followed in song in New York City, Paris, and Venice. Many characters act, interact, and sing in each city. They include young lovers Holden and Skylar, Skylar's parents Bob and Steffi, Steffi's ex-husband Joe, Steffi and Joe's daughter Djuna \"DJ\", a lady Joe meets named Von, and recently released prison inmate Charles Ferry.",
        "synopsis": "Skylar and Holden are an upper-class Manhattan couple (\" Just You, Just Me \"). Holden enlists DJ, Skylar's younger sister, to help him choose an expensive diamond engagement ring (\" My Baby Just Cares for Me \"). Skylar wants a \"take-charge\" kind of guy (\" I'm a Dreamer, Aren't We All \"). Holden's romantic gesture, at DJ's urging, backfires when Skylar swallows the ring he slipped into her parfait , resulting in a trip to the ER (\" Makin' Whoopee \").\n\nBob and Steffi Dandridge, liberal Democratic lawyers (\" Looking at You \") who have a blended family from previous marriages, are aghast at having a Republican son, Scott, who wants criminals taken off the street and disapproves of Steffi's work rehabilitating felons. Steffi, who volunteers with the American Civil Liberties Union (\"He was an abused child who made one mistake.\"), brings to the engagement party one of her causes, Charles, who scares guests with accounts of prison stabbings. Initially alarmed by Charles's aggressive passes (\" If I Had You \"), Skylar eventually falls under his spell (\"I've never been kissed by a sociopath before.\"), breaking up with Holden.\n\nSteffi and Bob are friendly with Steffi's neurotic ex-husband Joe, who lives in Paris, and has just broken up with his latest drug-using nymphomaniac girlfriend (\"I'm through with Love\"). Steffi wants to fix Joe up with a more suitable woman, but Joe is still hung up on Steffi.\n\nOn vacation with her father Joe in Venice , Italy, DJ and her friend, whose mother is a psychologist, listen through a hole in the wall on the clientele's therapy sessions. Von, an art historian , relates to the therapist that she is discontented with her husband, longing for romance and discussing her fantasies. DJ suggests Joe \"run into\" Von jogging and then coaches Joe on how to woo her by faking interest in art, music, travel, African daisies, and a hastily bought Parisian garret, and by setting up \"coincidental\" meetings at a museum and a concert. Convinced she has met the man of her dreams (\"All My Life\"), the unsuspecting Von leaves her husband for Joe.\n\nDJ falls for a gondolier and plans to drop out of college to marry him until she meets her next \"flame\": a student at Columbia University (\" Cuddle up a Little Closer, Lovey Mine \"). She then falls for a rapper in New York, and finally falls in love with a dashing Parisian .\n\nCompetitive sisters Lane and Laura, DJ's half-sisters, both have crushes on a local lad, heir to the Vandermost millions, but 14-year-old Laura is heartbroken when Vandermost falls for Lane (\" I'm Through with Love \").\n\nGrandpa, an 88-year-old with dementia , occasionally wanders off, corralled by Freda the maid, who DJ jokingly claims was Hitler 's maid at Berchtesgaden . (\"It's Bavarian pasta, it doesn't need any sauce; Italian pasta needs sauce.

Begging to be let out of the getaway car, Skylar successfully escapes and eventually reconciles at a Halloween Party with a forgiving Holden (\" Chiquita Banana \"). This time Skylar swallows the engagement ring Holden has slipped in a box of Cracker Jack .\n\nScott is diagnosed with a blockage in an artery that has restricted the flow of oxygen to his brain, but it successfully resolves. He immediately resigns from the Young Republicans Club and starts to espouse left-wing causes .\n\nHaving lived out all her fantasies with \"the man of her dreams\", Von no longer yearns for them; she leaves Joe to return to her husband.\n\nThe family goes to Paris for Christmas and attends a Groucho Marx -themed New Years party (\" Hooray for Captain Spaulding \"). When Bob comes down with a cold, Steffi reunites with Joe and they reminisce, acknowledging that although their marriage didn't work out (\"I'm Through With Love\"), they still have feelings for each other. Although Steffi loves Bob \"wholeheartedly\", she and Joe kiss while accepting the boundaries of their mutually supportive relationship. Steffi encourages Joe to find someone who will make him happy.

        "title": "Operation Mincemeat (musical)",
        "description": "Operation Mincemeat is a musical comedy with book, music and lyrics by David Cumming , Felix Hagan , Natasha Hodgson and Zo\u00eb Roberts (known as the musical comedy troupe SpitLip, with this show being their debut production). The plot is based on Operation Mincemeat , a Second World War British deception operation. The show received six Laurence Olivier Award nominations, winning two for Best New Musical and Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical for Jak Malone , and garnered four Tony Award nominations including Best Musical , and won for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Malone.",
        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nIn 1943, Naval intelligence officer Ewen Montagu welcomes the audience to MI5 , where the \"elite\" of the British military contribute to the World War II effort (\"Born to Lead\"). Colonel Johnny Bevan informs his subordinates that the British government requires a strategy to convince the Nazis that the Allied Forces are planning to invade Sardinia rather than their actual (and more obvious) target, Sicily ; several officers, including Montagu and Ian Fleming , present their ideas, but despite their conviction of their own brilliance (\"God That's Brilliant\"), Bevan dismisses them all as uncreative and poorly planned. Sulking after his rejection, Montagu encounters Air Force officer and \"amateur naturalist\" Charles Cholmondeley , who has formulated a strategy code-named \"Operation Mincemeat\", but is convinced of its futility after being bullied out of line by Montagu and his colleagues (\"Dead in the Water\"). Montagu reads his plan, and despite declaring it \"insane\", recognises its potential and convinces Charles that they should team up to pitch Mincemeat to Bevan, noting his own natural \"flair for presentation\" (\"Dead in the Water (Reprise)\").\n\nMeanwhile, secretary Hester Leggatt welcomes new clerk Jean Leslie to her team, who disdains the typically side-lined role of women in MI5 and dreams of ranking alongside the male officers (\"All the Ladies\"). Although Jean tries to stop them while bringing Bevan tea, Montagu and Charles arrive at the last minute to pitch Mincemeat. After Charles fumbles their presentation, Montagu recognises Jean\u2019s worthwhile attempts to help and drafts her in to explain the plan: MI5 will obtain a male corpse, dress it as a British soldier , plant documents on it \"revealing\" the Allied plans to invade Sardinia, and place it where the Nazis will discover it and use the documents as cause to move their troops from Sicily (\"The Pitch\"). Bevan is highly sceptical, but concedes that it is the one decent idea he has heard and allows the operation to proceed, with Jean and Hester officially drafted in as support, but covertly assigns Hester to investigate Montagu, who is believed to be in contact with his brother Ivor , a filmmaker who is suspected to be a spy for the Russian government .\n\nTogether, Montagu, Charles, Jean and Hester create a fake Royal Marines major, \"Bill Martin\"; to ensure his identity is \"watertight\", Hester falsifies numerous identification papers, Montagu and Jean source receipts for a week of leisure in London (by literally having a week of leisure in London), and Charles purchases an engagement ring so the receipt can be on Bill\u2019s person, along with a photograph of Jean posing as Bill's imagined fianc\u00e9e (\"Making a Man\"). Charles notices that Montagu occasionally \"misplaces\" important files, but suppresses his concerns. A corpse, that of an unnamed nomad who ingested rat poison, is obtained with the help of Montagu's morally dubious acquaintance Bernard Spilsbury (\"Spilsbury\"); the team are concerned about using it without the knowledge and consent of any relatives, let alone knowing his real name, but Montagu is adamant that it is better if the corpse is a \"nobody\". Bevan is unimpressed by the team's spending spree, but concedes that their creation is believable. As the operation prepares to commence, he declares that Bill should be carrying a letter from his fianc\u00e9e; after dismissing Charles and Jean\u2019s questionable efforts at writing one (\"Love is a Bird\"), Hester indirectly relates her own story of the lover she lost during World War I , and agrees to a deeply moved Jean\u2019s request that she write the letter herself (\"Dear Bill\").\n\nThat night, Montagu and Charles arrive in Scotland to load \"Bill's\" corpse onto the submarine HMS Seraph ; its crew are told that the sealed canister contains meteorological equipment (\"Sail On, Boys\"). Charles is deeply insecure about the result of the operation, but is swayed by Montagu into celebrating its completion, later witnessing a brief meeting between the latter and Ivor (\"Just For Tonight\"); meanwhile, after enduring enemy attacks, the crew of the Seraph are unnerved by the contents of the canister but follow their orders, placing Bill in the sea beyond the Spanish coast before thanking him for his service.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe German army present a display of their apparent dominance (\"Das \u00dcbermensch\"). After reprimanding the audience for \"appreciating\" the enemy, Bevan relates the progression of Mincemeat and reveals that a problem has arisen (\"Bevan's Update\"). The team await news from Vice-Consul Francis Haselden in Huelva , but are dismayed to learn that the victim of an aeroplane accident he calls to report is a live American soldier, also named William; they fear it will make Bill\u2019s story less believable. Moments later, they learn Bill has also been recovered, and they instruct Haselden to make sure the briefcase holding the false plans is seized by the Nazi-populated Spanish authorities, amidst news that the latter are indeed suspicious and have ordered an autopsy (\"The Ballad of Willie Watkins\").\n\nMeanwhile, Bevan calls the team into his office to reveal that the original problem was entirely different: Spilsbury's methodology is flawed and he should not have been trusted with the operation (\"Spilsbury Reprise\"). Montagu insists that Mincemeat is running smoothly despite the setbacks, but Bevan orders the immediate abortion of all plans (\"I Call Abort\"); however, this fails to reach Haselden, who diligently ensures that the autopsy is rushed and the briefcase reaches the authorities (\"Haselden's Got a Good Feeling\"). Charles and Jean attempt to keep working through the crises, but Montagu believes they can do no more and simply wants to enjoy himself; he is hurt by Jean reminding him that their London excursions were merely for the operation. After an animated reprimanding by Bevan for his nonchalance and failure to obtain consent for the use of Bill's body, Montagu fully dismisses Jean's role in Mincemeat and orders her to go back to her role as a clerk and assistant. Furious and humiliated, Jean confesses to Hester that she'd pictured the veneration they'd receive if the operation was a success; Hester gently persuades her that not everyone who works for a cause will be recognised, but that does not make them any less valuable \u2013 whether they are spearheading an operation or making tea \u2013 and Jean thanks her for helping her to \"grow\" (\"Useful\"). Hester is inspired to disclose the suspicion around Montagu's brother, and Jean agrees to swallow her pride and investigate.\n\nCharles once again catches Montagu hiding files, and after Montagu describes tactics for getting people to trust him, Charles also begins investigating him; meanwhile, Haselden is ordered to drop hints that the British desperately want Bill\u2019s briefcase back, Hester worries about the increasing number of missing documents, and Bevan tries to keep plans for the Sicilian invasion afloat (\"Act as If\"). Eventually, Montagu discovers Charles, Jean and Hester going through his possessions; despite his protests, they read his files, and learn that he is actually writing a film script about Mincemeat depicting himself as a hero; he was secreting files so that he could archive them for personal use, being careful not to let them into the wrong hands, and he was talking to Ivor \u2013 a filmmaker \u2013 to get his opinion on a rough, censored draft of the script. While appalled that he intends to sensationalise their story, Charles, Jean, and Hester conclude that Montagu is innocent.\n\nAn update from Bevan then confirms that Haselden's whisper campaign has worked, and Adolf Hitler himself has ordered the transfer of German troops from Sicily to Sardinia. The Allies subsequently invade Sicily with little-to-no bloodshed, and Bevan informs an ecstatic Montagu, Charles, Jean and Hester that Operation Mincemeat is officially a success, and that Montagu and Charles will receive the highest level of commendation in the British Army (\"Did We Do It?\"). As the team celebrate, they observe that the unfortunate moral of their story is \u201cwhen you write the book, you\u2019re off the hook\u201d.\n\nTo counteract this, they relate a summary of everything that occurred following the success of Mincemeat: the Second World War is won by the Allies with help from the US Army; Ian Fleming goes on to create James Bond ; Haselden and his assistant Steve remain in Spain; Hester initiates a romance with Bevan; Jean looks ahead to the progress of feminism during and after the war; Montagu eventually makes (and acts in) his film about Operation Mincemeat; and Charles goes on to do classified work for MI5. As Bevan finishes relating the events of the operation to his superiors, they wonder who the man known as Bill Martin really was; the cast address the audience to inform them that thanks to Montagu's archives, he was eventually identified as a gardener named Glyndwr Michael , and that there is now an inscription in Huelva acknowledging that he served in the Second World War as Major William Martin (\"A Glitzy Finale\" ).",

        "description": "Spamalot (also known as Monty Python's Spamalot: A Musical (Lovingly) Ripped Off from the Motion Picture Monty Python and the Holy Grail ) is a musical with music by John Du Prez and Eric Idle , and lyrics and a book by Idle. Based on the 1975 film Monty Python and the Holy Grail , the musical offers a highly irreverent parody of Arthurian legend , with the title being a portmanteau of Spam and Camelot .\n\nThe original 2005 Broadway production directed by Mike Nichols received 14 Tony Award nominations, winning in three categories, including Best Musical . During its initial run of 1,575 performances, the production was seen by more than two million people and grossed over $168 million. Tim Curry starred as King Arthur in the original Broadway and West End productions. It was one of eight UK musicals commemorated on Royal Mail stamps, issued in February 2011.\n\nA film adaptation, directed by Casey Nicholaw from a script by Idle, was  announced. Idle later stated on Twitter that the film would not be made due to his former Monty Python colleagues vetoing the project.",
        "synopsis": "### Before the show\n\nA recording encourages members of the audience to \"let your cell phones and pagers ring willy-nilly,\" and comments that they should \"be aware there are heavily armed knights on stage that may drag you on stage and impale you.\" This was recorded by Eric Idle .\n\n### Act I\n\nA historian narrates a brief overview of medieval England. In a miscommunication between the actors and the narrator, the actors sing an introductory song about Finland (\" Fisch Schlapping Song \"). The Historian returns, irritated, and tells the frolicking Finns that he was talking about England, not Finland.  The scene immediately changes to a dreary, dark village with penitent monks in hooded robes chanting Latin and hitting themselves with wooden boards (\"Monk's Chant\"). King Arthur travels the land with his servant, Patsy, who follows him around banging two coconut shells together to make the sound of a horse's hooves as Arthur \"rides\" before him. Arthur aims to recruit Knights of the Round Table to join him in Camelot (\"King Arthur's Song\"). Arthur and Patsy encounter a pair of sentries who begin debating the probability of finding a coconut in a non-tropical climate.\n\nRobin, a collector of plague victims, and Lancelot , a handsome and hot-tempered man, meet as Lancelot attempts to dispose of the sickly Not Dead Fred. Although a plague victim, the man insists that he is not dead yet and he can dance and sing. He begins performing a dance number, but is soon knocked unconscious with a shovel by an impatient Lancelot (\"He Is Not Dead Yet\"). Lancelot and Robin agree to become Knights together; Lancelot wants to fight in battles, and Robin wants to sing and dance professionally. Not Dead Fred revives, declaring he will serve as Robin's musician, only to be promptly killed by Lancelot.\n\nWhile attempting to recruit a peasant named Dennis Galahad, Arthur explains that he became King of England because the Lady of the Lake gave him Excalibur , the sword given only to the man fit to rule England. However, Dennis and his mother, Mrs. Galahad, are political radicals and say that any king who has not been elected by the people has no legitimate right to rule over them. To settle the issue, Arthur asks the Lady of the Lake and her Laker Girls (named after the cheerleading squad ) to appear before Dennis, which they promptly do (\"Come with Me\"). Cheered on by the girls (\"Laker Girls Cheer\"), the Lady of the Lake turns Dennis into Sir Galahad and together, they sing a generic Broadway love song (\"The Song That Goes Like This\"). Arthur knights Galahad, and subsequently Robin and Lancelot. Together with Sir Bedevere and the \"aptly named\" Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Show, a knight resembling Don Quixote who promptly apologises and leaves, they become the Knights of the Round Table (\"All for One\").\n\nArthur and the four knights gather in Camelot, a deliberately anachronistic place resembling Las Vegas's Camelot-inspired Excalibur resort , complete with showgirls, oversized dice and the Lady of the Lake as a lounge singer reminiscent of Liza Minnelli (\"Knights of the Round Table\"/\"The Song That Goes Like This (Reprise)\"). In the midst of their revelry, they are contacted by God (a recording voiced by John Cleese in the original Broadway production, Eric Idle in the version that toured the UK, and Steve Martin in the Broadway revival), who tells them to locate the Holy Grail .\n\nUrged on by the Lady of the Lake (\"Find Your Grail\"), the knights set off. They travel throughout the land until they reach a castle, only to be viciously taunted by lewd French soldiers. Bedevere comes up with the idea to retaliate by sending them a large wooden rabbit in the style of the Trojan horse ; however, the knights realize after the fact that they forgot to hide inside the rabbit before the French soldiers took it.  Defeated, they leave in a hurry when the French soldiers begin taunting them again, sending cancan dancers after them and throwing barnyard animals at them (\"Run Away!\"). Arthur and his followers manage to run into the safety of the wings before the French soldiers catapult the Trojan rabbit at them.\n\n### Act II\n\nThe knights are separated after the French soldiers' attack. In a forest, Arthur and Patsy meet the terrifying but silly Knights Who Say Ni , who demand a shrubbery . Arthur has no idea where to find a shrubbery, but Patsy cheers him up (\" Always Look on the Bright Side of Life \") and they find a shrubbery shortly after. Sir Robin wanders the forest with his minstrels (\"Brave Sir Robin\"), and they encounter the Black Knight , who scares Robin away. Arthur then encounters the Black Knight and defeats him by cutting off both his arms and legs, impaling his still-alive torso on a door, and leaving to give the shrubbery to the Knights Who Say Ni.\n\nArthur and Robin reunite. The Knights Who Say Ni accept the shrubbery and then demand that Arthur put on a musical and bring it to Broadway, on the condition it is not a production by Andrew Lloyd Webber , as the mere mention of his name causes everyone to cover their ears and scream in pain (in the United Kingdom , this is written as a West End musical; on the tour, they must put on a \"Broadway musical\"). Robin insists that it would be impossible to accomplish this next task, since a successful Broadway (or West End) musical requires the involvement of Jewish people (\"You Won't Succeed on Broadway\"). Robin proves his point in a wild production number filled with Ashkenazi Jewish cultural references, a list of Jewish celebrities known for their work on Broadway (including Bette Midler , Barbra Streisand , Stephen Sondheim , and as a joke in the 2023 revival, George Santos ), and a Fiddler on the Roof parody involving a bottle dance with Grails instead of bottles. Arthur and Patsy promptly set off in search of Jews.\n\n(In countries that don't have a tradition of Jews in the theatre, the lyrics of \"You Won't Succeed on Broadway\" are sometimes changed to instead describe the high production standards and acting talent needed to stage a successful musical in that country.  For example, in the South Korean version, Sir Robin sings about recent successful musicals that were staged in Seoul during the previous decade.  Meanwhile, members of the ensemble appear onstage dressed as various characters from those musicals.  Among these characters are a cat from Cats , Kenickie from Grease , Kim from Miss Saigon , the Phantom from The Phantom of the Opera , and Velma Kelly from Chicago .)\n\nWhile the Lady of the Lake laments her lack of stage time (\"Diva's Lament (What Ever Happened to My Part?)\"), Sir Lancelot receives a letter of distress from someone who is being forced into an arranged marriage . He is very surprised to find that the supposed \" damsel in distress \" is actually an effeminate young man named Prince Herbert (\"Where Are You?\"). Herbert asks Lancelot to help him escape. Herbert's music-hating father, the King of Swamp Castle, cuts the rope that Herbert is using to climb out of the window, and Herbert falls to his apparent death. Lancelot is a bit puzzled at the king's actions, but discovers that his squire Concorde saved Herbert at the last minute. When Herbert begins to explain, in song, how he was saved, the king charges at Herbert with a spear, preparing to kill him. Lancelot steps in to save Herbert, then gives a tearful, heartfelt speech to the king about sensitivity on Herbert's behalf. The king correctly guesses that Lancelot is homosexual , and Herbert helps Lancelot accept his sexuality in a disco number (\"His Name Is Lancelot\").\n\nArthur begins to give up hope of ever putting on a Broadway musical and laments that he is alone, ignoring Patsy (\"I'm All Alone\"). The Lady of the Lake appears and tells Arthur that he and the Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along (in some productions she also points out Patsy's presence, to which Arthur claims that he sees Patsy as family and thus does not always consider him a separate person). Patsy reveals he is half Jewish, but did not previously disclose this because Arthur is a Christian . The Lady of the Lake tells Arthur that to end the musical, he must find the Grail and marry someone. Arthur proposes to the Lady of the Lake, and she happily accepts. They plan to marry after Arthur finds the Grail (\"Twice in Every Show\").\n\nThe knights reunite, recruit Sir Bors , and meet Tim the Enchanter, a pyromancer who warns them of the danger of a killer rabbit . When the rabbit bites off Bors' head, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, knocking down a nearby hill and revealing that the \"evil rabbit\" was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. (The letters are based on the seat numbering system used by each theatre. They are changed from performance to performance to discourage audience members from intentionally booking any of the possible seats.  The seat is typically on the aisle in one of the first few rows nearest the orchestra. In the Broadway production and on the tour it is either A101, B101, C101 or D101; i.e., Seat 101 \u2013 which is house right of the center aisle \u2013 of Rows A, B, C, or D. In the West End production a word is revealed \u2013 DONE, CONE or BONE, referring to D1, C1 and B1 respectively.)\n\nAfter pondering the final clue, a confused Arthur asks God for help. A large hand points to the audience and Arthur realises that the letters and numbers refer to a seat number in the audience. The grail is \"found\" (with some sleight of hand ) under the seat, and the person sitting in the seat is rewarded with a small trophy and a polaroid photo (\"The Holy Grail\"). Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake, who reveals that her name is Guinevere, and Lancelot marries Herbert, who finally gets a chance to sing without interruption from his father. Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in musical theatre . The King of Swamp Castle attempts to interrupt the finale and stop the singing, but Lancelot knocks him unconscious with a shovel. The company then invites the audience to partake in a sing-along of \" Always Look on the Bright Side of Life \". (\"Act 2 Finale / Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Company Bow)\").",

The Little Prince has been adapted to numerous art forms and media, including audio recordings , radio plays , live stage, film, television, ballet, and opera.",
        "synopsis": "The book begins with the six-year-old narrator. To determine if grownups are as enlightened as a child, the narrator shows them a picture depicting a boa constrictor that has eaten an elephant. The adults always reply that the picture represents a hat. Upon making a second drawing depicting the elephant inside the boa constrictor, the adults tell him to study things of \"importance.\" He learns to only talk of \"reasonable\" things to them, rather than the fanciful.\n\nThe narrator becomes an aircraft pilot, and one day, his plane crashes in the Sahara desert, far from civilization. The narrator must fix his airplane before his supply of water runs out. Here, he is greeted by a young boy named \"the little prince.\"\n\nThe prince asks the narrator to draw a sheep. The narrator first shows him the picture of the elephant inside the snake, which, to the narrator's surprise, the prince interprets correctly. After three failed attempts at drawing a sheep, the frustrated narrator draws a crate, claiming the sheep is inside. Surprisingly, this drawing delights the little prince.\n\nOver the course of days, while the narrator attempts to repair his plane, the prince recounts his life story. He used to live on a house-sized asteroid known on Earth as \"B 612\". The narrator recounts a story of a Turkish astronomer who, after discovering asteroid B 612, gave a presentation on his findings, but was ignored. After dressing in European garments, however, his discoveries were accepted. The asteroid has three minuscule volcanoes (two active, and one dormant or extinct ) and various plants.\n\nThe prince used to clean the volcanoes and weed unwanted seeds and sprigs that infested his soil, pulling out baobab trees that were constantly on the verge of overrunning the surface. The prince wants a sheep to eat the undesirable plants, but worries it will also eat plants with thorns.\n\nThe prince met a rose that grew on the asteroid. The rose exaggerated ailments to have the prince care for her. The prince made a screen and glass globe to protect her from the cold and wind, watered her, and kept the caterpillars off.\n\nDespite falling in love with the rose, the prince also began to feel that she was taking advantage of him and resolved to leave the planet to explore the rest of the universe. Upon saying their goodbyes, the rose apologized for failing to show that she loved him. She wished him well and turned down his desire to leave her in the glass globe, saying she would protect herself. The prince laments that he does not understand how to love his rose while being with her.\n\nAfter leaving his planet, the prince visited six other planets, each of which was inhabited by one adult:\n\nLanding in a desert, the prince believed that Earth was uninhabited. He then met a snake that claimed to have the power to return him to his home, if he ever wished that.\n\nThe prince next met a flower, who said she had only seen a few men in that part of the world, and they had no roots, letting the wind blow them around and living hard lives. After climbing the highest mountain he had ever seen, the prince hoped to see the whole of Earth, thus finding the people; however, he saw only the desolate landscape. When the prince called out, his echo answered him, which he interpreted as the voice of someone boring who only repeats words.\n\nThe prince encountered a row of rosebushes, becoming downcast at having once thought that his rose was unique and thinking she had lied about being unique. He began to feel that he was not a great prince, as his planet contained only three tiny volcanoes and a flower he now thought of as common. He started weeping until a fox came along.\n\nThe fox desired to be tamed and taught the prince how to tame him. By being tamed, something goes from being ordinary or commonplace to being special and unique... but \"what we tame, we are responsible for forever.\"\n\nFrom the fox, the prince learns that his rose was indeed special because she was the object of the prince's love and time; he had \"tamed\" her, and now she was more precious than all of the other roses. Upon their departure, the fox says that important things can only be seen with the heart, not the eyes.\n\nThe prince then met two people from Earth:\n\nEight days after the plane crash, the narrator and the prince are dying of thirst. The prince becomes morose and longs to return home and see his flower. Although losing hope, the prince insists that \u201csomewhere in the desert there is a well,\u201d urging the narrator to continue. And at dawn, the narrator finds the well, saving them.\n\nThe prince reminds the narrator that his plane must still be fixed, leaving him there until the work is done. Upon successfully repairing the plane and returning to the prince, the narrator finds the prince talking to the snake, discussing his return home and his desire to see his rose again, worrying that she has been left to fend for herself.\n\nThe prince bids farewell to the narrator and states that if it looks as though he has died, it is only because his body is too heavy to take with him to his planet. The prince warns the narrator not to watch him leave, as it will upset him. The narrator, realizing what will happen, refuses to leave the prince's side. The prince says that the narrator only needs to look at the stars to think of the prince's laughter and that it will seem as if all the stars are laughing. The prince then walks away and allows the snake to bite him, falling down.\n\nThe next morning, the narrator cannot find the prince's body. Managing to repair his airplane, he leaves the desert. The narrator ends his story by addressing the reader directly, requesting to be contacted if one ever encounters a boy like the prince.",

        "synopsis": "In the \"world of the dead\", Luigi Lucheni is being interrogated by a judge as to why he has murdered the Empress Elisabeth. Lucheni claims that he did no more than what Elisabeth herself wanted, since all her life Elisabeth has been in love with Death himself \u2013 and vice versa. As his witnesses, Lucheni brings back the dead aristocracy of the bygone era and takes us to the past, where he serves as a sarcastic narrator of the events that lead to the transformation of the sweet and innocent Sisi to the revered and infamous Elisabeth, Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, and her decline through later years until her assassination.\n\nAt a young age, Sisi, grown up in a seemingly sorrowless environment, experiences her first encounter with Death, which launches a love\u2013hate affair that will span her entire life. Lucheni claims that once Franz Joseph, the Emperor of Austria, picks Elisabeth as his bride \u2013 for once opposing his domineering mother Sophie \u2013 he begins a chain of events that will eventually topple the Habsburg Empire. Elisabeth herself very soon comes to regret her seemingly \"fairy-tale marriage\". She feels abandoned by her careless husband, psychologically abused by her possessive mother-in-law, and is chronically depressed due to her loneliness. There is only one thing that keeps her emotionally stimulated\u2014the dark and sensual shadow of Death; but Elisabeth is reluctant to consummate their relationship. When Death takes her infant daughter, the tragedy shakes the young Empress extremely, but she refuses to give in to Death's sway.\n\nAfter her other two children, including her only son Rudolf, are taken away by Sophie, Elisabeth calluses over and becomes cold and selfish. She flees the Austrian court and spends decades restlessly travelling all over the world, trying in vain to escape from her fear of emptiness. Eventually, Elisabeth makes peace with her husband and finds new meaning in her life when she helps unify Austria and Hungary, but her newfound purpose makes her neglect her psychologically delicate son even further, sending young Rudolf into deep depression and causing him to bond with Death.\n\nEventually, Rudolf's own loneliness and his father's pressure cause him to snap and he embraces Death, committing suicide at Mayerling with his mistress, Mary Vetsera. This event completely breaks down Elisabeth and she begs Death to take her. However, her scorned lover now refuses to take her in.\n\nAnother decade goes by. Elisabeth still wanders from place to place, dressed in permanent mourning. Franz Joseph visits her from time to time, begging her to return home to Vienna, firmly believing that love is the answer to all sorrows, but Elisabeth refuses, saying that sometimes love is simply not enough to cure old wounds.\n\nIn a horrifying vision of the fall of the House of Habsburg, Franz Joseph at last meets his mysterious rival. He watches as Death tosses a dagger to Lucheni, but, crushed by the weight of his imperial crest, he is powerless to save his wife.\n\nOn 10 September 1898, while on her way to board a ship in Geneva, Empress Elisabeth of Austria is mortally wounded, stabbed right in the heart with a crudely sharpened file. As she lies dying, Death comes to claim her spirit with a kiss and an embrace.",

Many have unsuccessfully attempted to remove the sword, and the sword becomes forgotten, leaving England in the Dark Ages .\n\nYears later, a 12-year-old orphan named Arthur , commonly called the Wart, accidentally scares off a deer his older foster brother Kay was hunting, causing Kay to launch his arrow into the forest. While retrieving the arrow, Arthur meets Merlin , an elderly wizard who lives with his talking pet owl Archimedes. Merlin declares himself Arthur's tutor and returns with him to his home, a castle run by Sir Ector , Arthur's foster father. Ector's friend, Sir Pelinore , arrives to announce that the winner of the upcoming New Year's Day tournament in London will be crowned king. Ector decides Kay will be a contender and appoints Arthur as Kay's squire .\n\nTo educate Arthur, Merlin transforms them both into fish. They swim in the castle moat to learn about physics , until an angry pike attacks the pair. After the lesson, Arthur is sent to the kitchen as punishment for attempting to relate what happened to Ector and Kay. Merlin enchants the dishes to wash themselves, then takes Arthur out again for another lesson.\n\nFor the next lesson, Merlin transforms them both into squirrels to learn about gravity. Arthur almost gets eaten by a wolf, but is saved by a female squirrel who falls in love with him. After they return to human form, Ector accuses Merlin of using black magic on the dishes. Arthur defends Merlin, but Ector punishes Arthur by giving Kay another squire, Hobbs.\n\nResolving to make amends, Merlin plans on educating Arthur full-time, but Merlin's knowledge of future history confuses Arthur, prompting Merlin to appoint Archimedes as Arthur's teacher. Merlin transforms Arthur into a sparrow and Archimedes teaches him how to fly. Soon after, Arthur encounters Madam Mim, an eccentric, evil witch who is Merlin's nemesis. Merlin arrives to rescue Arthur before Mim can destroy him, and Mim challenges Merlin to a wizards' duel. Despite Mim's cheating, Merlin outsmarts her by transforming into a germ and infecting her, illustrating the importance of knowledge over strength.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, Kay is knighted. When Hobbs comes down with the mumps , Ector reinstates Arthur as Kay's squire, which spurs him to happily break the news to his teachers. Archimedes congratulates him, but Merlin, thinking Arthur is forsaking education, rebukes him for staying under Kay's thumb. When Arthur retorts that he's lucky, Merlin angrily transports himself to 20th-century Bermuda , leaving Archimedes in charge of Arthur.\n\nAt the tournament, Arthur realizes he left Kay's sword at the inn. It is closed for the tournament, but Archimedes sees the \"Sword in the Stone\", which Arthur removes almost effortlessly, unknowingly fulfilling the prophecy. When Arthur returns with the sword, Ector recognizes it and the tournament is halted. Ector places the sword back in its anvil, demanding Arthur prove that he pulled it. Kay suggests that anyone can pull it once it's been pulled, but they soon find out that it is as stuck as ever.  Arthur pulls it once again, revealing that he is England's rightful king, earning Ector and Kay's respect and the former's apology.\n\nLater, the newly crowned King Arthur sits in the throne room with Archimedes, feeling unprepared for the responsibility of ruling a country. Merlin returns from Bermuda and reconciles with Arthur by resolving to help him become the great king he has foreseen him to be and ensure his legacy.",

He regularly has affairs with female guests with no intention of continuing the fling beyond their time at the hotel (\"License to Chill\").\n\nIn Cincinnati , Ohio, Rachel and Tammy prepare to go on vacation at the Margaritaville before Tammy gets married. Her fianc\u00e9, Chadd, forces Tammy to go on a diet of carrot juice and sunflower seeds, so she can lose weight for the wedding, which infuriates Rachel. Chadd has Tammy promise not to cheat on him and his friends warn the two women of the land sharks. Tammy and Rachel laugh their warning off and travel to the hotel (\" Fins \").\n\nRachel is disappointed with the condition of the hotel, even though Tammy is just happy to be on vacation. Tully flirts with Rachel, who is more concerned about work, and has Brick bring tequila shots, to which Rachel questions if it's the appropriate time to start drinking. Tully, Brick, J.D., and the patrons insist that (\" It's Five O'Clock Somewhere \"). Tully and Brick take the women's bags to their room, along with some margaritas. Rachel insists going up to the volcano so she can obtain a soil sample. Brick offers to drive them up in his run down convertible (\"Ragtop Day\").\n\nOn the way to the volcano, the car breaks down, and the four search for another form of transportation. Brick and Tammy hit it off, while Tully continues to flirt with Rachel, where she informs him of her experiment to use potatoes as an alternative energy resource and how it takes up much of her time, leaving her no time to relax (\"It's My Job\"). Brick and Tammy rent bikes and the four continue their journey.\n\nOn the beach, J.D. tells guests stories about his life and his buried treasure, which Marley dismisses as lies. After being ordered to leave the guests alone, J.D. begins to sing a song that she disapproves of and invites the guests sing along (\" Why Don't We Get Drunk \").\n\nAt the volcano, Tully tries to get Rachel to relax and enjoy her time on the island. He breaks the ice between them by teaching her how to play guitar (\"Three Chords\"). Tammy and Brick discuss their childhoods and how their parents had very high expectations for them, finding amusement that they had become the people their parents frowned upon (\"We Are The People Our Parents Warned Us About\"). During the song Brick hallucinates zombie insurance salesmen.  Brick and Tammy almost kiss before Tammy reveals that she is engaged. Later that night, Tully reveals  to Rachel that he grew up in Maine, where his father wanted him to continue the family line of fisherman.  He arrived at the island to get away from the cold weather, pollution, and irritations of society. Rachel, finding herself charmed, kisses him (\" Son of a Son of a Sailor \").\n\nBack at the hotel, everyone is recovering from the previous night of drinking and partying (\"My Head Hurts, My Feet Stink, and I Don't Love Jesus\").  Tully and Rachel prepare to go snorkeling and Marley notices something different about Tully. He then admits to her that he thinks he's in love with Rachel.  After swearing that she wouldn't tell anyone, she tells some guests, and word spreads around the hotel. Tully and Rachel spend the rest of the week in bed and on the beach, causing Tully to miss work. Brick tries to help keep Tammy from giving into her urge to sleep with him. On her last night on the island, he suggests they do something to distract her and the two decide to get tattoos, with Brick needing to be drunk due to his fear of needles.  On their last night on the island, Rachel and Tammy discuss how the past week has changed their views of the future (\"Medley: Coconut Telegraph/Last Mango in Paris/ Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes \").\n\nTully decides to tell Rachel how he feels, but she and Tammy leave before he can. Brick discovers that his tattoo on his stomach is of Tammy's face and admits to Tully that he has feelings for Tammy. The two lament about their failed romances, while J.D. looks for a salt shaker for his shrimp (\" Margaritaville \"). The guests feel tremors and realize the volcano is about to erupt. Everyone begins to panic, sending Margaritaville into chaos.\n\n### Act II\n\nJamal wonders where he will go after evacuating the island as the patrons panic, Marley tries to keep everyone calm, Tully and Brick pack the boat with whatever they can, and J.D. grabs a shovel (\" Volcano \"). After everyone is onboard of the evacuation boat, Marley notices J.D. is missing, and Jamal reveals that he saw him heading into the jungle. Tully and Brick go to find J.D., despite Brick's objections.\n\nIn the jungle, Tully tells Brick to think of things that make him happy in order to control his fear (\" Grapefruit\u2013Juicy Fruit \").  During which Brick learns how to manage his hallucinations of zombies with a tap dance number.  After which Tully and Brick find J.D., who is digging up his buried treasure. The two insist that the treasure isn't real, as they believe he just makes up his stories. The two are shocked when J.D. digs up a chest as Marley arrives, revealing she had to let the boat leave due to the guests panicking.  J.D. has Marley take them to his plane, which she hid due to his pilot license being revoked.  At the airport, Tammy and Rachel prepare to take off and Rachel learns that funding for her experiment has been denied, much to her dismay.\n\nUp in the air, J.D. flies Marley, Tully, and Brick to safety. Tully and Brick go through J.D.'s treasure and find pictures and journals, learning that J.D. moved to Europe, married an actress, and had a son. His wife and son were killed when a bomb went off, while J.D. survived. J.D. tells the two that even though he's been through tragedy, he's had a good life (\" He Went to Paris \"). Tully reveals to J.D. that he hoped the treasure would be money that he could give to Rachel to help fund her experiment. J.D. tells Tully that the real treasure is what is in the heart and the memories of all the good times.  He insists that Tully tell Rachel that he loves her, to which Tully has J.D. fly them to Cincinnati.\n\nAt a bar in Cincinnati, Tammy and Chadd's rehearsal dinner is underway. She prepares to go eat a cheeseburger, but Chadd has set up a vegetarian buffet for her, due to her diet. She fantasizes about eating a cheeseburger, when Brick enters and urges her to quit her diet (\" Cheeseburger in Paradise \"). Chadd sees them eating the burgers and tells Tammy that he can't love her if she's fat, causing Tammy to punch him and call the wedding off.  J.D. and Marley discuss about the time they slept together ten years ago, and admit that they have feelings for each other. Tully enters and tells Rachel that he loves her, to which Rachel isn't sure how to respond. Tully plays a song to remind her of their time together on the island (\"Tin Cup Chalice\"). She admits that she has feelings for Tully, but they are too different and that a relationship probably won't last. She leaves and Tully is approached by Ted, a talent agent, who insists that Tully can become famous with his music.\n\nOver the course of three years, Brick and Tammy get married and have a daughter; after being denied by numerous banks, Rachel finally gets funding for her research; J.D. and Marley become a couple, rebuild Margaritaville, and have a daughter; and Tully becomes an international music star (\"Love and Luck\"). Tully returns to Margaritaville to perform for the hotel's re-opening and notices Rachel in the crowd.  The two catch up and realize they are still in love with each other (\" Come Monday \").  A year later, Brick and Tammy receive an invitation to Tully and Rachel's wedding and first class tickets. Tully, Rachel, Tammy, Brick, J.D. and Marley reflect on how much their lives have changed in the past few years as the wedding is being prepared and the guests arrive (\" A Pirate Looks at Forty \").  The two are married and everyone celebrates at Margaritaville (\" One Particular Harbor \").",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nJ. Pierrepont Finch, a young window cleaner in New York City, reads the book How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying as he works. The \"Book Voice\" tells him that he will succeed if he follows the book's advice. He enters the World Wide Wicket Company searching for a job (\"How To Succeed\").\n\nFinch bumps into J. B. Biggley, the president of the company, who dismisses him to the personnel manager, Mr. Bratt. Rosemary Pilkington, an ambitious young secretary, helps Finch meet Mr. Bratt. Finch tells Bratt that Biggley sent him, and Bratt gives him a job in the mailroom, where he works with Mr. Biggley's lazy, arrogant, and nepotism -minded nephew Bud Frump. Rosemary dreams of a life with Finch in the suburbs (\"Happy To Keep His Dinner Warm\"). The fatigued workers rush to get their coffee break (\"Coffee Break\"). In the mailroom, Finch earns favor with the long-time head of the mailroom, Mr. Twimble, who tells him the secret to longevity at the company (\"The Company Way\").\n\nTwimble is promoted to head of the shipping department and has to choose his replacement as head of the mailroom. The book warns not to stay in the mailroom too long, so Finch recommends Frump instead of himself. Twimble is reluctant to promote the lazy Frump, but Frump promises to be a good employee (\"The Company Way (Reprise)\"). Twimble and Bratt are impressed by Finch's apparent selflessness, and Bratt offers him a job as a junior executive in the Plans and Systems department, headed by Mr. Gatch.\n\nAn extremely attractive but air-headed woman named Hedy LaRue, who is Mr. Biggley's secret mistress, is hired as a secretary. On her first day of work, the male employees are instantly attracted to her, but Mr. Bratt warns them against taking advantage of their employees (\"A Secretary Is Not a Toy\"). Finch learns from Mr. Biggley's secretary, Miss Jones, that Biggley is a proud alumnus of Old Ivy College . In the elevator at the end of the workday, Rosemary's fellow secretary Smitty helps her and Finch set up a date (\"Been a Long Day\"). Frump runs into Biggley and Hedy and realizes their relationship, and he blackmails Biggley into giving him a promotion (\"Been a Long Day (Reprise)\").\n\nFinch arrives early Saturday morning and sets up the office so it looks like he has been working all night. Biggley believes Finch's ruse, and Finch convinces Biggley that he, too, is a proud alumnus of Old Ivy (a \"Groundhog\"), and they sing the Old Ivy fight song (\"Grand Old Ivy\"). Biggley insists that Finch be given his own office and secretary, Hedy. With the book's help, Finch realizes that Biggley must be Hedy's advocate and sends her on an errand to Gatch, knowing that Gatch will make a pass at her. Gatch falls for the trap and is dispatched to Venezuela , and Finch is promoted to his position as head of Plans and Systems.\n\nAt a reception for the new Advertising Department head, Benjamin Burton Daniel Ovington, Rosemary hopes to impress Finch with her new \"Paris original\" dress, but all the other women arrive at the reception wearing the same dress (\"Paris Original\"). Frump schemes for Biggley to catch Finch kissing LaRue in his office, but after LaRue blackmails Finch into kissing her, he realizes he's actually in love with Rosemary (\"Rosemary\"). After some farcical complications, Frump and Biggley walk into the office just as Finch embraces Rosemary. Ovington is forced to resign when Biggley learns that he is a graduate from Northern State, Old Ivy's bitterest rival (a \"Chipmunk\"). Biggley names Finch vice-president in charge of advertising. Biggley leaves as Finch and Rosemary declare their love for each other, and Bud Frump vows revenge (\"Act I Finale\").\n\n### Act II\n\nTwo days later, Rosemary has been neglected by Finch. She decides to quit, but her fellow secretaries convince her to stay because she's living their dream of marrying an executive (\"Cinderella, Darling\"). (In the 1995 revival, this song was replaced with a reprise of \"How to Succeed\", with the lyrics suggesting ways in which a woman can get hold of a man's financial assets).\n\nThe book warns Finch that because vice-president of advertising is a bad position, he needs a brilliant idea. Bud Frump slyly tells Finch his idea for a treasure hunt, which Finch loves, unaware that Biggley has already heard the idea and rejected it. Finch shares the idea with Rosemary, who tells him that she'll stay with him no matter what happens (\"Happy To Keep His Dinner Warm (Reprise)\"). Hedy tells Biggley that she is unhappy as a secretary and is leaving for California . He begs her to stay and tells her he loves her, and she agrees to stay (\"Love From a Heart of Gold\"). In the executive washroom, Finch gives himself a pep talk while, behind his back, the other executives and Frump plot against him (\"I Believe In You\").\n\nFinch presents \"his\" idea to Biggley: he will hide five thousand shares of company stock in each of the ten offices around the country and give a television audience weekly clues as to their whereabouts. Biggley accepts this idea when Finch explains that each clue will be given by the scantily-dressed World Wide Wicket Treasure Girl: Miss Hedy LaRue.\n\nDuring the first television show, Hedy is asked to swear on a Bible that she doesn't know the location of the prizes. Hedy panics and reveals the locations to the entire television audience, which prompts all the Wicket employees to tear apart the offices looking for them. The book tells Finch, \"How To Handle a Disaster. ...We suggest that your best bet if you are the cause of the Disaster is to review the first chapter of this book: 'How to Apply for a Job'.\"\n\nThe executives, including Chairman of the Board Wally Womper, are waiting in Biggley's office for Finch's resignation. Rosemary again tells Finch that she'll stand by him no matter what (\"I Believe in You (Reprise)\"). About to sign his letter of resignation, Finch mentions that he'll probably go back to washing windows. Womper is drawn to Finch as he, too, was a window washer and they both \"had a book\": Wally's book was a book of betting records. Finch blames the treasure hunt on Frump, also mentioning that Frump is Biggley's nephew. Womper is about to \"clean house from top to bottom\", when Finch steps in on everyone's behalf. Finch tells the executives that even though the business world is a place filled with betrayal and competitiveness, the World Wide Wicket staff is like a family to him (\"Brotherhood of Man\"). Everyone is spared except Frump, who is fired because he is Biggley's nephew.\n\nBiggley remains president, Womper retires to travel the world with his new wife, Hedy, and Finch becomes chairman of the board. Rosemary stands by his side and inadvertently inspires him to aspire for the Presidency of the United States . Frump gets a job washing windows, swearing revenge against Finch (\"Company Way (Finale)\").",

        "description": "The Jungle Book is a 1967 American animated musical adventure film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution . Based on the \"Mowgli\" stories from Rudyard Kipling 's 1894 book of the same name , it is the final animated feature film to be produced by Walt Disney , who died during its production. It was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman and written by Larry Clemmons , Ralph Wright , Ken Anderson , and Vance Gerry . Featuring the voices of Phil Harris , Sebastian Cabot , Louis Prima , George Sanders , and Sterling Holloway , the film's plot follows Mowgli , a feral child raised in the Indian jungle by wolves, as his friends, Bagheera the panther and Baloo the bear, try to convince him to leave the jungle before the ruthless tiger Shere Khan arrives.\n\nThe early versions of both the screenplay and the soundtrack followed Kipling's work more closely, with a dramatic, dark, and sinister tone, which Disney did not want in his family film, leading to writer Bill Peet and songwriter Terry Gilkyson being replaced.\n\nThe Jungle Book was released on October 18, 1967, to positive reception, with acclaim for its soundtrack, featuring five songs by the Sherman Brothers and one by Gilkyson, \" The Bare Necessities \". With a gross of $23.8 million worldwide, the film initially became Disney's second-highest-grossing animated film in the United States and Canada, the ninth-highest-grossing film of 1967 , and was also successful during its re-releases. The film was also successful throughout the world, becoming Germany's highest-grossing film by number of admissions. Disney released a live-action adaptation in 1994 and an animated sequel in 2003; a live-action/animated hybrid remake directed by Jon Favreau was released in 2016, with a sequel to that film in development.",
        "synopsis": "In the jungles of India , Bagheera the wise black panther discovers an orphaned baby boy and brings him to a pack of wolves , who name him Mowgli. Ten years later, the pack learns that the murderous Bengal tiger Shere Khan has returned to their area of the jungle. Knowing that he hates humans and will stop at nothing to kill Mowgli, the pack decides that the latter must leave; Bagheera agrees to escort Mowgli to a nearby \"Man-Village\", though Mowgli is reluctant to leave the only home he has ever known, as he does not fear Shere Khan, and believes he can last against him (not to mention that he has never met others of his own kind, thus everyone in the Man-Village will seem like strangers to him).\n\nBagheera and Mowgli rest in a tree where an Indian python named Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli by hypnotizing him, but is stopped by Bagheera. The next morning, Mowgli encounters Colonel Hathi and his elephant herd. Following an argument where Mowgli refuses to go to the Man-Village, he is abandoned by Bagheera. All alone, Mowgli meets and befriends Baloo, a laid-back and carefree sloth bear who promises Mowgli can stay in the jungle with him. Mowgli is soon kidnapped by monkeys who bring him to their leader, King Louie, an orangutan . King Louie tries to persuade Mowgli to teach him the ways of man, until Baloo and Bagheera arrive and rescue him, destroying King Louie's temple in the process.\n\nWhilst Mowgli is sleeping that night, Bagheera tries to convince Baloo that Mowgli must be taken to the Man-Village. Baloo remains unconvinced until Bagheera reminds him that Shere Khan will try and kill Mowgli, as he is afraid of guns and fire. This persuades Baloo, who tells Mowgli the next morning that he must take him to the Man-Village; feeling betrayed, Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. Bagheera later finds Colonel Hathi's herd and seeks their help in finding Mowgli. However, unbeknownst to any of them, Shere Khan has overheard this and now decides to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.\n\nWhilst going through the jungle, Mowgli is ambushed by Kaa once more, who hypnotizes him again. However, before he can devour him, Shere Khan arrives and tells Kaa that he is looking for a \"man-cub\"; Kaa manages to hide Mowgli. After escaping Kaa, Mowgli reaches the wastelands of the jungle where he meets and befriends a group of vultures. However, Shere Khan soon arrives and tries to kill Mowgli. He tries to fight, but soon begins to lose his nerve after realizing how terrifying the tiger truly is, before Baloo intervenes. Whilst Shere Khan attacks and nearly kills Baloo, Mowgli ties a burning branch to Shere Khan's tail, forcing him to run away in defeat. Mowgli now mourns the loss of Baloo; as Bagheera respectfully takes Mowgli away, Baloo reveals he is alive, much to everyone's happiness.\n\nAs they get closer to the Man-Village, Mowgli meets a girl getting water from the river. He follows her into the Man-Village, having finally accepted the fact that he is a human. Content that Mowgli is where he belongs, Baloo and Bagheera return to the jungle.",

He finds Nicolas working as an actor in a small theater, happy with his life (\"In Paris\").  They go to Nicolas' flat and it becomes clear they're in love with each other (\"The Bugs and the Bears\").  \nA vampire called Magnus attacks Lestat and turns him into a vampire (\"The Thirst\").  He struggles with this, and hides from his mother when she comes looking for him (\"Right Before My Eyes\").  Eventually he finds her and makes her a vampire to save her life, as she is sick (\"Make Me As You Are\").  They meet a vampire named Armand, who leads a group of satanist vampires.  He denounces them as blasphemers, but Lestat reveals to his followers that they do not actually serve the Devil (\"The Dark Laws / To Live Like This\").\nThey decide to become a troupe of actors.  Nicolas is discovered among them, and Lestat eventually transforms him too.  The troupe's first play tells the story of Armand and Marius, his maker (\"Morality Play\").

Nicolas speaks for the first time, asking to be released.  Lestat lights a fire to kill him, and scatters the ashes (\"Right Before My Eyes\" (reprise)) as Marius appears.\n\nMarius claims that he could not have saved Nicolas.

They live together for a time, but Louis becomes dissatisfied with the vampiric life (\"Embrace It\").\nLestat transforms Claudia, an orphan girl, which horrifies Louis, who nevertheless agrees to help raise her.  Time passes.  Claudia has a greater craving for blood, having been transformed at a young age (\"I Want More\").  She mourns the fact that she will stay a child forever (\"I'll Never Have That Chance\").  Lestat apologizes, and she tries to kill him.  Louis burns down the house.\nLater, on a ship, Lestat is wounded and thinks of what his life has become (\"Sail Me Away\"). He returns to Armand and the theater, where he discovers Louis and Claudia as members of the troupe.

Louis leaves (\"Embrace It\" (reprise)).\nArmand mocks Lestat when he asks why he killed Claudia (\"After All This Time\"). They argue about what Marius said, and Lestat is thrown from the roof, breaking his legs. He prepares to die in the coming sunlight (\"Sail Me Away\" (reprise)), but Marius and Gabrielle arrive and convince him to save himself (\"Crimson Kiss\" (reprise)).\nThe light goes off. Lestat appears, dressed in modern clothes, and says \"I am the Vampire Lestat, and I will live forever.\"",

        "title": "Meet Me in St. Louis (musical)",
        "description": "Meet Me in St. Louis is a 1989 musical based on the 1944 film of the same name , which in turn is based on the 1942 novel of the same name by Sally Benson . The musical is about a wealthy lawyer's large family and household living in St. Louis, Missouri in a Victorian era style mansion and their excitement and anticipation of the family and the city on the eve of the 1904 World's Fair . (a.k.a. the Louisiana Purchase Exposition) celebrating the centennial of the Louisiana Purchase from France and Spain . As the year progresses leading up to the fair's opening, the family is distraught and upset over father's proposed promotion and move east to bigger New York City leaving behind all their friends and familiar surroundings.\n\nThe later musical varied from the earlier film with additional songs and some additional character development; the focus is not primarily on the character of Esther, as in the film. The musical play ran on Broadway in New York City in 1989, 45 years after the famous 1944 musical feature film starring Judy Garland. It was revived to be performed again Off-Broadway in 2004, / 2006 another 15 years later. Interest and audience continued in its hometown of St. Louis in 2009 followed by a leap across the Atlantic Ocean to London in England by 2013.",
        "synopsis": "The musical opens in the summer of 1903. The family is going about their daily businesses \u2013 Tootie is playing with her dolls, Agnes is practicing her stilt walking, Esther is playing tennis, Rose is relaxing, Lon received his Princeton catalog in the mail, Mrs. Smith and Katie, their maid, went shopping, Grandpa is playing with Agnes, and Mr. Smith was at work (\"Opening\" / \"Meet Me in St. Louis\"). Upon request from Esther, Katie asks Mrs. Smith if they could have dinner an hour earlier because her sister is having trouble with her husband. We soon learn that the real reason is that Warren Sheffield, a Yale scholar and heir to a grand fortune, is calling Rose long-distance at 6:30, when they usually eat dinner. Esther was trying to get dinner to be an hour earlier so the family would be out of the room when he called. Soon Rose enters and tells Esther that John Truitt, their neighbor and the boy that Esther has a crush on, is outside with his friend. They pretend to want to go to the pool, and try to attract the boys' attention. However, Agnes enters looking for her cat, and John leaves, causing Esther to lament about how John Truitt never notices her (\"The Boy Next Door\").\n\nA little later that day, Mr. Smith comes home in a bad mood, because he lost his case. He refuses to eat an hour earlier and storms offstage to go take his cool bath. Meanwhile, Tootie and Agnes begin to fight over a doll, causing the older siblings to have to break them up and remind them that they're all friends (Whenever I'm With You). Everyone exits except for Ester and Mrs. Smith. Esther asks if she is too young to fall in love, and her mother is shocked by the question. She proceeds to tell of how she fell in love with Mr. Smith (\"You'll Hear a Bell\").\n\nDinner is approaching, and by now everyone in the family knows about Warren's telephone call except for Mr. Smith. When he joins the family at the dinner table, everyone gulps down their food so they can leave before Warren calls. Unfortunately, they are not fast enough, and the telephone rings. Mr. Smith answers, but is confused when the operators tell him that someone is calling from New York. He hangs up, and Esther accidentally tells him everything out of anger. He soon figures out that he was the only one who didn't know about the call, and tries to put his foot down, but when the phone rings again he tells Rose to answer it. Her phone call turns out to be less than successful, because he was only calling to ask how she was, and he said if his parents knew he was calling, they would kill him. Katie tries to lighten the mood (\"Meet Me in St. Louis\" (Reprise)).\n\nA few months later, we are at Lon's going-away party, right before he leaves for Princeton. Warren tries to apologize to Rose, but she refuses to accept (\"Raving Beauty\"). At the party, Esther is formally introduced to John Truitt, pretending not to know who he is. She takes his hat and hides it in the piano. The guests then participate in a square dance called by Lon and Warren (\"Skip to My Lou\"). Agnes and Tootie have crept to the landing to see what was going on, and after being caught, perform a dance they do with Esther (\"Under the Bamboo Tree\"). Afterwards the guests leave, but Esther asks John if he would like to come with them to the Fairgrounds on Friday. He agrees, and then she asks him if he will help her turn off the lights, because she's afraid of the dark (\"Over the Bannister\"). He leaves, leaving Esther slightly disappointed.\n\nOn Friday, they get on the trolley to the fairgrounds, where John Truitt just barely makes it on (\"The Trolley Song\").\n\nAct II opens on Halloween, where Tootie and Agnes are getting ready to go trick or treating. After they leave, Katie asks the older sisters why they won't go out to the Halloween Social. They both respond that men are too bothersome and they'd rather not. Katie gives them some advice (\"Touch of the Irish\"). Immediately following the number, a scream is heard offstage. Tootie comes in with a bloody lip, saying John Truitt hit her. When he comes by to ask if she's alright, Esther beats him up for hurting her little sister. Agnes enters soon after, telling what happened. They stuffed one of Katie's dresses so it looked like a body, then put it on the trolley tracks so when the motorman had to put on the brakes, the trolley would come off the tracks. Tootie then reveals that it was not John who hurt her, but she fell. Esther is ashamed and goes to apologize to John. He forgives her (\"The Boy Next Door\" (Reprise)).\n\nMr. Smith comes home and breaks the news to the family that they are moving to New York. He thought the family would be happy, but they all are shocked and upset. He tries to convince them that it will be fun, but it doesn't work (\"A Day in New York\"). They all exit, leaving Mr. and Mrs. Smith alone. Mrs. Smith tries to comfort him, reminding him that as long as they are together, they can be happy (\"You'll Hear a Bell\" (Reprise) / \"Wasn't It Fun\").\n\nNow it is winter and their last Christmas in St. Louis is fast approaching. Both Rose and Warren are left without dates. Rose didn't respond to Warren's proposal to the dance, so he decided to go with Lucille Ballard who is Lon's girlfriend. Esther and Katie persuade them to go with each other, and Rose and Esther make a plan to fill out Lucille's dance card with the worst people imaginable. Unfortunately, John Truitt comes by and tells Esther that he can't take her to the dance because his tuxedo is locked up in the tailor's. Grandpa comes to the rescue, inviting Esther to the dance with him.\n\nAt the ball, Lucille suggests that Warren and Rose and she and Lon be partners for the evening. Esther doesn't realize that, and ends up taking Lucille's dances. Lon leads everyone in a dance he learned at college (\"The Banjo\"). John comes, in his tuxedo, after calling every Jones in St. Louis until he found who ran the shop. After the dance, John proposes to Esther, but she feels bad about it because he would have to give up going to college to be with her in New York (\"You Are for Loving\").\n\nEsther enters the house to find Tootie sitting on the couch. She's upset about leaving St. Louis, and has been waiting for Santa to come so she can tell him that they're moving. Esther tries to convince Tootie that New York will be fun (\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\"). Mr. Smith sees how upset Tootie is and decides that they can't move to New York.\n\nAfter hearing the good news, the family goes to the fair and everything works out well (\"Trolley Song\" (Reprise) / \"Meet Me in St. Louis\" (Reprise II) / \"Finale\").",

This was Jason Robert Brown's first produced show, originally produced Off-Broadway at the WPA Theatre in 1995. Brown and director Daisy Prince put together songs he had written for other venues and events, resulting in \"neither musical play nor revue, it is closer to a theatrical song cycle , a very theatrical song cycle.\"\n\nThe show lies between musical and song cycle , but it is neither; it is an abstract musical, a series of songs all connected by a theme: \"the moment of decision.\" The show has four performers who do not play the same characters throughout the show but who do have consistently developing character arcs nonetheless. Composer Brown has said, \"It's about one moment. It's about hitting the wall and having to make a choice, or take a stand, or turn around and go back.\"\n\nBecause of its small cast and orchestra, Songs for a New World has become a favorite small show for colleges and local theatres, despite its vocally demanding score.",

The musical explores the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, two teenage street gangs of different ethnic backgrounds. The Sharks, who are recent migrants from Puerto Rico , and the Jets, who are white , vie for dominance of the neighborhood, and the police try to keep order. The young protagonist, Tony, a former member of the Jets and best friend of the gang's leader, Riff, falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks. The dark theme, sophisticated music, extended dance scenes, tragic love story, and focus on social problems marked a turning point in musical theatre.\n\nThe original 1957 Broadway production, directed and choreographed by Robbins, marked Sondheim's Broadway debut. It ran for 732 performances before going on tour. The production was nominated for six Tony Awards , including Best Musical , in 1958, winning two. The show had an even longer-running West End production, a number of revivals, and international productions. A 1961 musical film adaptation , co-directed by Robert Wise and Robbins, was nominated for eleven Academy Awards and won ten, including Best Picture . A 2021 film adaptation , directed by Steven Spielberg was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture , along with six additional nominations, winning for Best Supporting Actress .",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nTwo rival teenage gangs, the Jets (white Americans) and the Sharks ( Puerto Ricans ), struggle for control of the San Juan Hill neighborhood on the Upper West Side of Manhattan (Prologue). Police officers Krupke and Lt. Schrank warn them to stop fighting on their beat. The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street. The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his best friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance. Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them (\"Jet Song\"). Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come. Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over. Tony is convinced that something important is round the corner (\" Something's Coming \").\n\nMaria works in a bridal shop with Anita, the girlfriend of her brother, Bernardo. Maria has just arrived from Puerto Rico for her arranged marriage to Chino, a friend of Bernardo's. Maria confesses to Anita that she is not in love with Chino. Anita makes Maria a dress to wear to the neighborhood dance.\n\nAt the dance, after introductions, the teenagers begin to dance; soon a challenge dance is called (\"Dance at the Gym\"), during which Tony and Maria (who aren't taking part in the challenge dance) see each other across the room and are drawn to each other. They dance together, forgetting the tension in the room, and fall in love. Bernardo pulls his sister from Tony and sends her home. Riff and Bernardo agree to meet for a War Council at Doc's, a drug store which is considered neutral ground, but meanwhile, an infatuated and happy Tony finds Maria's building and serenades her outside her bedroom (\" Maria \"). She appears on her fire escape, and the two profess their love for one another (\" Tonight \"). Meanwhile, Anita, Rosalia, and the other Shark girls discuss the differences between the territory of Puerto Rico and the mainland United States of America, with Anita defending America, and Rosalia yearning for Puerto Rico (\" America \").\n\nThe Jets get antsy while waiting for the Sharks inside Doc's drugstore. Riff helps them let out their aggression (\" Cool \"). The Sharks arrive to discuss weapons to use in the rumble. Tony suggests \"a fair fight\" (fists only), which the leaders agree to, despite the other members' protests. Bernardo believes that he will fight Tony, but must settle for fighting Diesel, Riff's second-in-command, instead. This is followed by a monologue by the ineffective Lt. Schrank trying to find out the location of the rumble. Tony tells Doc about Maria. Doc is worried for them while Tony is convinced that nothing can go wrong; he is in love.\n\nThe next day, Maria is in a very happy mood at the bridal shop, as she anticipates seeing Tony again, but she is dismayed when she learns about the upcoming rumble from Anita. When Tony arrives, Maria insists that he must stop the fight altogether, which he agrees to do. Before he goes, they dream of their wedding (\" One Hand, One Heart \"). Tony, Maria, Anita, Bernardo and the Sharks, and Riff and the Jets all anticipate the events to come that night (\" Tonight Quintet \"). The gangs meet under the highway and, as the fight between Bernardo and Diesel begins, Tony arrives and tries to stop it. Though Bernardo taunts and provokes Tony, ridiculing his attempt to make peace, Tony keeps his composure. When Bernardo pushes Tony, Riff punches him in Tony's defense. The two draw their switchblades and get in a fight (\"The Rumble\"). Tony attempts to intervene, inadvertently leading to Riff being fatally stabbed by Bernardo. Tony kills Bernardo in a fit of rage, which in turn provokes an all-out fight like the fight in the Prologue. The sound of approaching police sirens is heard, and everyone scatters, except Tony, who stands in shock at what he has done. The tomboy Anybodys, who stubbornly wishes that she could become a Jet, tells Tony to flee from the scene at the last moment and leaves with the knives. Only the bodies of Riff and Bernardo remain.\n\n### Act 2\n\nBlissfully unaware that the rumble has taken place with fatal consequences, Maria giddily sings to her friends Rosalia, Teresita, and Francisca that she is in love (\" I Feel Pretty \"). Chino brings the news that Tony has killed Bernardo, then leaves. Maria prays that what he has told her is a lie. Tony arrives to see Maria and she initially pounds on his chest with rage, but she still loves him. They plan to run away together. As the walls of Maria's bedroom disappear, they find themselves in a dreamlike world of peace (\" Somewhere \").\n\nTwo of the Jets, A-Rab and Baby John, are set on by Officer Krupke, but they manage to escape him. They meet the rest of the gang. To cheer themselves up, they lampoon Krupke and the other adults who don't understand them (\" Gee, Officer Krupke \"). Anybodys arrives and tells the Jets that she has been spying on the Puerto Ricans; she has discovered that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. The gang separates to find Tony and protect him. Action has taken charge; he accepts Anybodys into the Jets and includes her in the search.\n\nA grieving Anita arrives at Maria's apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria to meet him at Doc's so they can run away to the country. In spite of her attempts to conceal it, Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and launches an angry tirade against him (\" A Boy Like That \"). Maria counters by telling Anita how powerful love is (\"I Have a Love\"), and Anita realizes that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. She admits that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. Lt. Schrank arrives to question Maria about her brother's death, and Anita agrees to go to Doc's to warn Tony that Maria will be late. Unfortunately, the Jets, who have found Tony, have congregated at Doc's, and they taunt Anita with racist slurs and eventually attempt rape. Doc arrives and stops them. Furious, Anita spitefully delivers the wrong message, telling the Jets that Chino has shot Maria dead.\n\nDoc relates the news to Tony, who has been dreaming of heading to the countryside to have children with Maria. Feeling there is no longer anything to live for, Tony leaves to find Chino, begging for him to shoot him as well. Just as Tony sees Maria alive, Chino arrives and shoots Tony. The Jets, Sharks, and adults flock around the lovers. Maria holds Tony in her arms (and sings a quiet, brief reprise of \"Somewhere\") as he dies. Angry at the death of another friend, the Jets move towards the Sharks but Maria takes Chino's gun and tells everyone that \"all of [them]\" killed Tony and the others because of their hate for each other, and, \"Now I can kill too, because now I have hate!\" she yells. However, she is unable to bring herself to fire the gun and drops it, crying in grief. Gradually, all the members of both gangs assemble on either side of Tony's body, showing that the feud is over. As Krupke takes a remorseful Chino into custody, the Jets and Sharks form a procession, and together carry Tony away, with Maria the last one in the procession.",

        "description": "Goblin Market is an 1862 narrative poem by Christina Rossetti . It tells the story of sisters Laura and Lizzie, who are tempted with fruit by goblin merchants. In a letter to her publisher, Rossetti claimed that the poem, which is interpreted frequently as having features of remarkably sexual imagery, was not meant for children. However, in public Rossetti often stated that it was intended for children, and went on to write many children's poems. When it appeared in her first volume of poetry, Goblin Market and Other Poems , it was illustrated by her brother, the Pre-Raphaelite artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti .",
        "synopsis": "Goblin Market tells the adventures of two close sisters, Laura and Lizzie, with the river goblins .\n\nAlthough the sisters seem to be quite young, they live by themselves in a house, and draw water every evening from a stream. As the poem begins, the sisters hear the calls of the goblin merchants selling their fantastic fruits in the twilight. On this evening, Laura, intrigued by their strangeness, lingers at the stream after her sister goes home. (Rossetti hints that the \"goblin men\" resemble animals with faces like wombats or cats, and with tails.) Longing for the goblin fruits but having no money, the impulsive Laura offers to pay a lock of her hair and \"a tear more rare than pearl.\"\n\nLaura gorges on the delicious fruit in a sort of bacchic frenzy. Once finished, she returns home in an ecstatic trance, carrying one of the seeds. At home, Laura tells her sister of the delights she indulged in, but Lizzie is \"full of wise upbraidings,\" reminding Laura of Jeanie, another girl who partook of the goblin fruits, and then died at the beginning of winter after a long and pathetic decline. Strangely, no grass grows over Jeanie's grave. Laura dismisses her sister's worries, and plans to return the next night to get more fruits for herself and Lizzie. The sisters go to sleep in their shared bed.\n\nThe next day, as Laura and Lizzie go about their housework, Laura dreamily longs for the coming meeting with the goblins. That evening, however, as she listens at the stream, Laura discovers to her horror that, although her sister still hears the goblins' chants and cries, she cannot.\n\nUnable to buy more of the forbidden fruit , Laura sickens and pines for it. As winter approaches, she withers and ages unnaturally, too weak to do her chores. One day she remembers the saved seed and plants it, but nothing grows.\n\nMonths pass, and Lizzie realises that Laura is wasting to death. Lizzie resolves to buy some of the goblin fruit for Laura. Carrying a silver penny , Lizzie goes down to the brook and is greeted warmly by the goblins, who invite her to dine. But when the merchants realise that she has no intent to eat the fruit, and only intends to pay in silver, they attack, trying to feed her their fruits by force. Lizzie is drenched with the juice and pulp, but consumes none of it.\n\nLizzie escapes and runs home, but when the dying Laura eats the pulp and juice from her body, the taste repulses rather than satisfies her, and she undergoes a terrifying paroxysm .\n\nBy morning, however, Laura is fully restored to health. The last stanza attests that both Laura and Lizzie live to tell their children of the evils of the goblins' fruits, and the power of a bond between sisters.",

        "description": "The Three Caballeros is a 1944 American live-action/animated musical anthology film produced by Walt Disney and released by RKO Radio Pictures . The film premiered in Mexico City on December 21, 1944, and was released in the United States on February 3, 1945. It was later released in the United Kingdom in March 1945.\n\nThe film celebrates the tenth anniversary of Donald Duck and follows his journey through Latin America, combining live-action with traditional animation. It is the second of the six package films released by Walt Disney Productions during the 1940s, following Saludos Amigos (1942), and is one of the earliest feature films to blend live-action and animation.\n\nThe narrative is presented through a series of self-contained segments, linked by the framing device of Donald receiving birthday gifts from his Latin American friends. Featured performers include Aurora Miranda (sister of Carmen Miranda ), Dora Luz , and Carmen Molina .\n\nThe film was developed as part of the studio's contribution to the U.S. Good Neighbor policy toward Latin America during World War II . Donald is joined by returning character Jos\u00e9 Carioca from Brazil and a new companion, the pistol-toting rooster Panchito Pistoles from Mexico.",
        "synopsis": "The film, celebrating Donald Duck's 10th anniversary, consists of seven segments, each connected by a common theme. In the film, it is Donald Duck 's birthday (namely Friday the 13th), and he receives three presents from friends in Latin America . The first present is a film projector , which shows him a documentary about birds called \"Aves Raras\" . The first segment of the documentary tells the story of Pablo, a penguin seeking the warm weather of Equatorial South America. The next segment details some of the odd birds of Latin America. During this part of the documentary, he learns about the Aracuan Bird , who received his name because of his eccentric song. The documentary then shifts to the perspective of a man narrating a story from his childhood, where he discovers and befriends a donkey with the wings of a condor in Uruguay .\n\nThe next present is a book given to Donald by Jos\u00e9, a native of Brazil. This book tells of Bahia (spelled \"Ba\u00eda\" in the film), which is one of Brazil's 26 states. Jos\u00e9 shrinks them both down so that they can enter the book. Donald and Jos\u00e9 meet up with several of the locals, who dance a lively samba , and Donald ends up pining for one girl Yaya, the Quindim seller, but fails and gets jealous of another man. After the journey, Donald and Jos\u00e9 leave the book.\n\nUpon returning, Donald realizes that he is too small to open his third present. Jos\u00e9 shows Donald how to use \"black magic\" to return himself to the proper size. After opening the present, he meets Panchito, a native of Mexico. The trio take the name \"The Three Caballeros\" and have a short celebration. Panchito then presents Donald's next present, a pi\u00f1ata . Panchito tells Donald of the tradition behind the pi\u00f1ata. Jos\u00e9 and Panchito then blindfold Donald, and have him attempt to break open the pi\u00f1ata, eventually revealing many surprises. The celebration draws to a close when Donald is fired away by firecrackers in the shape of a ferocious toy bull (with which the firecrackers are lit by Jos\u00e9 with his cigar).\n\nThroughout the film, the Aracuan Bird appears at random moments. He usually taunts everyone with his madcap antics, sometimes stealing Jos\u00e9's cigar and trying to make Jos\u00e9 jealous. His most famous gag is when he re-routes a train that Donald and Jos\u00e9 are riding on by drawing new tracks, causing the train to disassemble.\n\nThe film consists of seven segments:\n\n### \"The Cold-Blooded Penguin\"\n\nThis segment is narrated by Sterling Holloway , reproducing images of the penguins of in Antarctica . In the segment, a penguin named Pablo is so fed up with the freezing conditions of the South Pole that he decides to leave his home for warmer climates, navigating the long coast of Chile (including the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands and Vi\u00f1a del Mar ), passing by Lima (the capital of Peru ) and Quito (the capital of Ecuador ) before landing on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands .\n\n### \"The Flying Gauchito\"\n\nThis segment, with adult narration provided by Fred Shields, involves the adventures of a little boy from Uruguay and a winged donkey, who goes by the name of Burrito (which is Spanish for \"little donkey\").\n\n### \"Ba\u00eda\"\n\nThis segment involves a pop-up book trip through the Brazilian state of Bahia (spelled Ba\u00eda in the film), as Donald and Jos\u00e9 meet up with some of the locals who dance a samba and Donald pining for one of the women, a Quindim seller named Yaya (portrayed by singer Aurora Miranda ), who later gives Donald a kiss after he gives her a bouquet of flowers.\n\n### \"Las Posadas\"\n\nThis is the story of a group of Mexican children who celebrated Christmas by re-enacting the journey of Mary, the mother of Jesus and Saint Joseph searching for room at the inn. \"Posada\" meant \"inn\", or \"shelter\", and their parents told them \"no posada \" at each house until they came to one where they were offered shelter in a stable. This leads to festivities including the breaking of the pi\u00f1ata , which in turn leads to Donald Duck trying to break his own pi\u00f1ata as well.\n\n### \"Mexico: P\u00e1tzcuaro, Veracruz and Acapulco\"\n\nPanchito gives Donald and Jos\u00e9 a tour of Mexico City and the country of Mexico on a flying sarape , or magic carpet. Several Mexican dances and songs are learned here. Later Donald pines for more women, tries to pursue every one he sees and gain return affections, but once more he fails every time and ends up kissing Jos\u00e9 while blindfolded.\n\n### \"You Belong to My Heart\" and \"Donald's Surreal Reverie\"\n\nThe skies of Mexico City result in Donald falling in love with singer Dora Luz . The lyrics in the song itself play parts in the scenarios as well. Then several imagined kisses lead to Donald going into the \"Love is a drug\" scene. Donald constantly envisions sugar rush colors, flowers, and Panchito and Jos\u00e9 popping in at the worst moments, making chaos. The scene changes after Donald manages to dance with Carmen Molina from the state of Oaxaca , from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . The two dance and sing the song \" La Zandunga \" . Carmen begins by singing the song, with Donald \"quacking\" out the rest of the chorus with her. The \"drunkenness\" slows down for a second after Donald multiplies himself while spinning in a circle, but speeds up again when Carmen reappears dressed in a Charro 's outfit and uses a horsewhip as a conductor's baton to make cacti appear in many different forms while dancing to \" Jesusita en Chihuahua \" , a trademark song of the Mexican Revolution . This scene is notable for providing the masterful combination of live-action and cartoon animation, as well as animation among the cacti.\n\nThe scene is interrupted when Panchito and Jos\u00e9 suddenly spice things up for the finale of the film, and Donald ends up battling the same toy bull with wheels on its legs the day before from earlier. The catch is that it is now loaded with fireworks and other explosives, following with a fireworks finale with the words \"The End\" exploding from the fireworks, first in Spanish ( Fin ), in the colors of the flag of Mexico , then the second in Portuguese ( Fim ), in the colors of the flag of Brazil , and finally in English, in the colors of the flag of the United States ( The End ).",

        "description": "Margie is a 1946 American romantic comedy film directed by Henry King and starring Jeanne Crain , about a high school girl in the 1920s who develops a crush on her French teacher. Margie was a box-office hit, ranking in the top 15 highest-grossing films of the year, and established Crain as an important Fox star. Although not a true movie musical (as it uses period recordings, with only a few songs being partially performed by characters in the film), it is sometimes classified with musicals for the large number of 1920s-era popular songs incorporated as nostalgic background in the film.\n\nThe film was the basis for the 1961 television sitcom Margie , featuring Cynthia Pepper .",
        "synopsis": "In 1946, Margie ( Jeanne Crain ) is a housewife reminiscing about her high school days with her own teenage daughter, who has just discovered her mother's old photo album in the attic. In a flashback to the 1920s, Margie is a high-spirited girl living with her dominant but good-hearted Grandmother McSweeney ( Esther Dale ). Her mother has died and her father ( Hobart Cavanaugh ), the local mortician , lives apart from Margie and her grandmother, only visiting on Wednesday due to his busy work schedule, and sometimes not even staying long enough to see his daughter. The youngest girl in her class, Margie does very well at her schoolwork, but she is not socially adept and wears old-fashioned clothing, including bloomers that frequently fall down. By contrast, her pretty and fashionable neighbor Marybelle Tenor ( Barbara Lawrence ) wears short skirts and lipstick and dates the popular but dimwitted captain of the football team, Johnny Green ( Conrad Janis ). Margie secretly has a crush on Johnny, but he regards her as a \"pain in the neck\". When Margie meets the handsome new French teacher at her high school, Professor Ralph Fontayne (Glenn Langan), she becomes even more smitten with him, and he seems to take an interest in her as well. Meanwhile, Margie's bumbling classmate Roy Hornsdale ( Alan Young ) is in love with her, and constantly attempts to court her despite her disinterest in him.\n\nMargie participates in a school debate and is excited that both her father and Mr. Fontayne attend. Margie's father is impressed with her debating skills and proud of her. Afterwards, at the skating rink, Margie gets a chance to skate with Johnny but while they are skating, her bloomers fall down. Mr. Fontayne, who is looking on, saves her from public embarrassment by hiding them and tactfully returning them to her later.\n\nWhen the big senior dance approaches, Margie plans to attend with Roy, but at the last minute Roy catches a cold and is forced to cancel, leaving Margie without an escort. Margie is too embarrassed to go alone or tell Marybelle, who is going with Johnny, that she doesn't have a date, and instead gives Marybelle the impression that Mr. Fontayne is taking her to the dance. Margie's grandmother meanwhile secretly arranges for her father to cancel a business meeting and take his daughter to the dance, but tells Margie only that a man \"much older than 15\" called to take her to the dance and withholds the man's identity to surprise Margie. When Mr. Fontayne comes to the house with a corsage , Margie thinks he is her date and is thrilled that her fantasy came true, until she sees by the florist's card that the corsage was intended for Mr. Fontayne's actual date, the school librarian Miss Palmer ( Lynn Bari ). Mr. Fontayne only stopped by to drop off Margie's French composition and compliment her on her good work, although he privately confesses to her grandmother that he would rather be taking Margie to the dance instead of Miss Palmer. Margie is at first devastated, but when her actual surprise date \u2014 her father \u2014 arrives to escort her to the dance, she is happy again. At the dance, Mr. Fontayne dances with Margie and tells her he would rather dance with her than anyone else, and she even attracts the attention of Johnny. Returning to the 1940s, it turns out Margie married Mr. Fontayne, who is now the principal at the same high school.",

The musical follows the woodland adventures of two amphibious friends, a worrywart toad and a perky frog, with their assorted colorful hopping, crawling and flying companions, over the course of a year. The show broke new ground by bringing professional children's theatre to Broadway, sparking the interest of the age 3-to-10 set.\n\nArnold Lobel's daughter, Adrianne Lobel , commissioned a musical based on her father's characters. She also designed the set, based on her father's writings. Her husband, actor Mark Linn-Baker , adapted the stories into a theatrical script, and later played Toad in the musical's Broadway debut. The original production and subsequent Broadway production was directed by David Petrarca .  The intimate, 5-actor piece is frequently played by community theatre companies.",
        "synopsis": "Act I\n\nFrog and Toad are hibernating (\"A Year With Frog and Toad\").  The birds are ready for spring, as the sleeping friends sing about their friendship and the year ahead (\"Spring\").  The protagonists awaken, and Toad begins to plant a garden, impatient that his plants grow slowly. He yells at the seeds but then worries that they are afraid to grow (\"Seeds\"). He sings, dances and plays the tuba to encourage them, which seems to work.\n\nThe next day, Frog writes a letter to Toad, because Toad is sad that he never receives mail, and gives it to Snail to deliver (\"The Letter\").  They then go swimming in the pond, but Toad is embarrassed to be seen in his bathing suit, and he tries to slip unseen into the water (\"Getta Load of Toad\").  But the animals come to look at Toad in his suit, and eventually, freezing, he must come out, where everyone sees him in his bathing suit. Turtle proceeds to feed the fish in the pond (\"Underwater Ballet\").\n\nLater on, Frog has left Toad a note that he has gone to the island on the lake to be alone, after embarrassing Toad in his bathing suit, and Toad worries that Frog is sad.  He rides a log out to the island, bringing lunch for the two of them, but he falls off the log into the water.  It turns out that Frog is in fact happy and simply wanted time alone to think (\"Alone\").  The two friends eat wet sandwiches without iced tea.\n\nSnail continues on his quest to deliver the letter to Toad. (\"The Letter (Reprise)\")\n\nLater on, at Toad's home, Toad is baking cookies. Frog and Toad, along with the Birds, go kooky eating cookies and wolf down the whole batch that were supposed to be for dessert (\"Cookies\").\n\nAct II\n\nFrog and Toad try to fly a kite with some difficulty, eventually succeeding despite heckling from the birds (\"The Kite\").\n\nBy the end of summer, leaves cover the ground and the Birds fly south for the winter (\"A Year With Frog and Toad (Reprise)\").  Each of the two friends intends to surprise the other by raking his yard (\"He'll Never Know\"), but the squirrels soon make a mess of the neat piles of leaves, so neither of the friends discovers the good deed that the other has done.\n\nA few days pass as a storm comes, and Frog tells Toad a scary semi-autobiographical story about a young Frog, whose parents; Mother Frog and Father Frog leave Young Frog to go find a way out of the woods.  The story continues as the young Frog escapes from being eaten by a Large and Terrible Frog (\"Shivers\").\n\nNow it is winter and the Moles come out to play (\"Snow Ballet\"). Snail continues to Toad's house to deliver the letter (\"The Letter (Reprise)\").\n\nFrog and Toad decide to go sledding down a hill that frightens Toad (\"Down The Hill\"). Frog falls off the sled, which bears Toad on a dangerous and bumpy path. Toad, angry that Frog had supposedly made him sled down the steep hill on purpose, initially declares to dissolve their friendship. Snail finally arrives with the letter that Frog had sent to Toad months earlier. The letter tells how Frog is only happy when his friend Toad is happy. Toad forgives Frog, and Snail is proud to have delivered his first letter (\"I'm Coming Out of My Shell\").\n\nFrog is late on Christmas Eve, and Toad is worried about all the bad things that might have happened to him (\"Toad to the Rescue\") Finally, Frog arrives, delayed by wrapping Toad's present (\"Merry Almost Christmas\").\n\nFrog and Toad are hibernating again in their respective beds.

        "synopsis": "Morrissey Hall is a girls' school in England . The day has hardly begun when Headmistress Julia Faysle reads in an unflattering remark about the quality of girls produced by her school. The Sixth Form mistake her subsequent concern for their health and grooming as being a sign that they are all about to be sold into slavery. The Fifth Form, in turn, find the Sixth's newest behaviour very strange and prepare their own defenses. The headmistress' secretary, Elizabeth Wilkins, attempts to convey to the audience that she is indeed not any part of this madhouse, then returns to her duties. Meanwhile, the headmistress and her faculty chum, Foresta Studley, get carried away with jolly memories of their own girlhood at Morrissey Hall.\n\nA letter arrives. It is for Helen Wells-Morton, from her boyfriend, Charles. The letter contains a key, and when a trunk arrives for Helen, Headmistress Faysle uses all her wiles to try to get the key so she can open and inspect the trunk. When it is finally opened, Charles leaps out and escapes to the upper reaches of the school. Early on in all this, a salesman, Richard Tidewell, has arrived to see the Headmistress. He has waited patiently in the outer office with Elizabeth for most of the Act, but now he must go. It is revealed that he and Elizabeth have fallen in love.\n\nThe Fifth Form, in a history competition, has won a Bumper Car ride, and the huge amusement park contraption is now set on the campus. The school loves the ride, but retaliation is obviously demanded. While Mrs. Delmonde rehearses a St. George and the Dragon pageant, the Bumper Car is attacked. It is obviously the beginning of the end. Miss Winkle, faculty leader of the Fifth Form and now drunk with power as commander of the Bumper Car, whips them around in the ride.\n\nIt has obviously been too much for the headmistress. She has, since the beginning of the Act, been sequestered in her office, seeing nobody, and having a lovely, quiet time pressing flowers and arranging them in an album. She is at peace. Helen, too, has found her dear if slightly reluctant Charles, and even manages to get him to sing with her on matters of the heart. But it is all too late. The Fifth and Sixth have been arming themselves from mail order catalogues, and even the Headmistress' perennial optimism seems tentative to say the least, just prior to the outbreak of full scale, all-school, hell-bent-for-leather war.\n\nSoon, however, life at Morrisey Hall has gone back to normal. The Sixth Form graduates and life goes on. And that does seem to be the glory of such a place: that in spite of everything\u2014the heartrending, overwhelming odds\u2014they do, always and ever, go on.",

        "synopsis": "Act 1, Scene 1. Oxford, England\n\nWhile visiting Ermyntrude Edwards (the Aunt of Evangeline Edwards) for afternoon tea, Edith Sanford and the Reverend Malcolm Pither argue about the ability of an English lady to travel the Continent alone, unmolested.  The tea ends with Pither promising to find a young, attractive, and virginal Englishwoman, who has made such a trip, to parade in front of Edith.\n\nAct 1, Scene 2. Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nEvangeline joins her friends (Joyce Arbuthnot-Palmer, Bertha, Henrietta, and Madeleine) in her dormitory, to pack up for her trip home after having completed her time at the Pensionnat Bellevue, a finishing school in Lausanne , Switzerland.  They speak of love and sex, while enjoying Bertha's \"special\" cocoa. Evangeline finds herself determined to explore the world of sex.  As they finish their cocoa and feverishly finish packing, Miss Pratt, their beloved Chemistry teacher, entreats them to \"combine scientific and earthly pursuits\" (\"Experiment\").\n\nAct 1, Scene 3. Lausanne, Switzerland\n\nEvangeline meets Andr\u00e9 de Croissant, a French theatrical producer, in a railway carriage as she travels back to Oxford. Andr\u00e9 begins to seduce Evangeline, offering to take her to France and to make her a star in his next Folies. Evangeline is wary of leaving her planned trip home (\"It's Bad For Me\"), but is becoming swayed.  Andr\u00e9 suggests a trip to Neauville-Sur-Mer, to \"teach\" her things.\n\nMadame Arthur, a fashion designer, and her son Hercule enter the carriage. They quickly provide Evangeline and Croissant with an impromptu fashion show.  Evangeline is shocked at the extravagance and price of a single dress.  However, when Andr\u00e9 purchases five dresses for her, she remembers to \"experiment\" and accepts the dresses.  She has been seduced.\n\nAct 1, Scene 4. Neuville, France\n\nThe scene opens with the beach crowd singing the virtues and pitfalls of an afternoon at the beach (\"Neauville-Sur-Mer\"). Madame Arthur and Hercule are chatting when Alexei, a Russian violinist joins them.  Alexei tries to explain to Madame Arthur the \"Russian soul\".  Count Mantalini joins the trio, and wonders what Alexei is currently depressed about.\n\nAfter some prodding, Alexei admits that he is in love with an English girl, a friend of de Croissant, Evangeline.  Madame Arthur promises to introduce Alexei to Evangeline. Clarissa Parks, a cocotte, sees the Count and Alexei and tries to join the group.  She is rebuffed by Madame Arthur, much to the chagrin of Count Mantalini. As she looks back at the others, she sings (\"Cocotte\").\n\nEvangeline and Andr\u00e9 enter to find Evangeline's school friend, Madeleine.\nEvangeline discovers that Madeleine was previously a kept woman.\nMadeleine was sent to Lausanne because her lover wanted a mistress with social polish.\nEvangeline tells her tale of meeting Andr\u00e9, and explains that he treats her like a daughter, not a lover.\nAs they catch up, Madame Arthur interjects herself to introduce Alexei and Mantalini.\n\nAndr\u00e9 receives a call announcing that he has received the financial backing needed to mount his next production.  However, Evangeline decides she does not want to be a star.  Andre promptly disengages with her and takes Madeleine to Paris to be his star.\n\nMantalini takes advantage of the situation to suggest a trip with Evangeline to Venice. She reluctantly agrees, and Mantalini is off to make preparations.  Once gone, Alexei comes back and expresses his love for Evangeline and begs her to go with him to Paris. When Alexei tells her to \"jump in... experiment\", she runs away with him (\"How Could We Be Wrong\").\n\nAct 1, Scene 5. Caf\u00e9 du Dome at Montparnasse, Paris\n\nAlexei and Evangeline have been in Paris for an unknown length of time, but they are penniless and hungry. They enter the caf\u00e9, hoping to find work and food, and overhear an American and a British woman discussing a soir\u00e9e featuring Olga Barshka, a Hungarian lesbian.  However, Evangeline and Alexei are more interested in the buffet.  They decide to crash the soir\u00e9e.\n\nOlga enters and performs (\"Georgia Sand\") in a dinner jacket, with two other women dressed the same way.  Evangeline asks a gentleman for his newspaper to find a job, only to discover the \"gentleman\" is Joyce.  Joyce left Lausanne, started performing with Olga, and met a painter named Pierre, a man nothing like her father, but just like her mother.\n\nJoyce suggests that Evangeline should model for another painter, Pedro.  Pedro mistakes her for a prostitute and Evangeline slaps him.  When the truth is revealed, that she and Alexei are penniless party crashers, Joyce offers to lend her some money.  Pierre says he will give the couple money, once he sells his paintings to his new patron.  The patron arrives; it is Count Mantalini. Evangeline remembers the trip to Venice, and Mantalini reiterates his desire.  With a quick apology to Alexei, Evangeline is off with Mantalini.\n\nAct 1, Scene 6. Venice, Italy\n\nThe house staff of the Palazzo Mantalini are busy cleaning and preparing for the visiting American's next party (\"They're Always Entertaining\"). Count Mantalini visits his palace, which he has rented to the Bambergs.  He and Daisy Bamberg discuss his desire for Daisy's daughter, Henrietta, yet another friend of Evangeline's from Lausanne.  He begins to devise a scheme to pass Evangeline onto his friend Constantine.\n\nAs the Bambergs' party begins, Daisy asks Henrietta to perform (\"Casanova\"). Evangeline and Mantalini arrive. The two girls, surprised to see each other, quickly catch up.  Mantalini takes the opportunity to explain his plan to Constantine.  Constantine gets a few moments alone with Evangeline and tries to encourage her to explore the Orient with him.  At the same time, Daisy and Mantalini inform Henrietta of his plans to marry her. Excited, she immediately tells Evangeline the good news.  Evangeline realizes the duplicity of men (\"Nymph Errant\"), and resigns herself once again to a new journey, this time with Constantine.\n\nAct 2, Scene 1. Athens, Greece\n\nTourists, along with Evangeline and Constantine, at the Acropolis are taking in the sights (\"Ruins\"). Demetrias Pappas, a friend of Constantine, runs into the couple. He is the head of a home for \"unfortunate girls\", and his secretary is none other than Evangeline's school chum, Bertha.  They catch up, and Evangeline reveals that she is still a virgin, as \"all my friends have been idealists or very tired business men.\"\n\nAct 2, Scene 2. Smyrna, Turkey\n\nEvangeline is stranded alone in Constantine's house, as fighting between Turks and Greeks erupts and there is the sound of gun-fire outside.  Constantine arrives, but only for a short visit, and he is soon off again to fight the Turks.  Kassim, a slave dealer, enters.  Evangeline, seeing an opportunity to leave Smyrna, decides to allow herself to be sold by Kassim and off they go.\n\nAct 2, Scene 3. A remote province of Turkey\n\nEvangeline has been sold and married into a harem, but she complains to Ali, the harem keeper, about the lack of intimacy with her new husband, whom she has yet to meet. He asks if she has ever been in love, and she tells him of a crush she once had (\"The Physician\").\n\nA new wife joins the Harem, Haidee Robinson, from San Francisco, California. She and Evangeline introduce themselves and Evangeline goes to feed the pigeons, while Haidee goes to be photographed, passing a third wife who is chanting.  Haidee begins to improvise a song based on the wife's chant (\"Solomon\") and then exits.\n\nEvangeline comes back into the Harem as a young American plumber, Ben Winthrop, breaks in to free Haidee.  Evangeline, tired of her continued virginity, persuades Ben to rescue her instead.\n\nAct 2, Scene 4. Arabian Desert\n\nEvangeline and Ben settle under some palm trees and read a newspaper, wondering if this isn't better than civilization (\"Back to Nature with You\"). Evangeline, tired of waiting to be seduced, tries to seduce Ben. Feigning a headache, she gets Ben to rub her temples, and when he asks if there is anything else he can do, she asks him to sing, so he sings of what he knows (\"Plumbing\"). Not being romantic, Evangeline gives up and suggests that they move on.\n\nAct 2, Scene 5. Paris, France\n\nAndr\u00e9 de Croissant is rehearsing the Folies de Paris, in which Madeline has become a prima donna and won't come out of her dressing room. As the rehearsal is about to start, the Rev. Malcolm Pither and his new wife, the former Miss Pratt, stop by to see Croissant. The rehearsal begins and the chorus begins singing, at Madeline's entrance, and Evangeline wanders onto the stage.\n\nCroissant is happy to see Evangeline again and is tired of Madeline's tantrums, so he offers her the starring role. The former Miss Pratt, excited to see her, asks her about her time since Lausanne.  Evangeline expresses disbelief at her own station: a year of travels with a plethora of men, and she is still \"a girl no man wants\".  Pither picks up on this instantly, and remembering his bet with Edith Sanford realizes that Evangeline is the niece of Ermyntrude Edwards.  He asks her to go with him to visit her Aunt in Oxford, to help him to win his bet with Edith.\n\nEvangeline wants to stay in Paris and star in the Folies, but she decides to watch Madeline's big number before deciding (\"Si Vous Aimez Les Poitrines\").  Evangeline is delighted, but even more delighted by the ten handsome young men who are part of the show.  She asks Madeline to introduce her to them, but Madeline warns her not to expect anything from them as \"a chorus boy is a chorus boy\", insinuating that all ten are homosexual.  Seeing no end in sight to her virginity, she decides to go back to Oxford.\n\nAct 2, Scene 6. Oxford, England\n\nEvangeline and Pither join Ermyntrude and Edith for tea.  Pither reminds Edith of the bet they made, and all are astonished to learn of Evangeline's travels.  As the others go in for tea, Evangeline asks to stay in the garden for a bit more.  Now alone, she hums a bit and remembers Miss Pratt's advice (\"Experiment\" - Reprise), just as a young and good-looking gardener, Joe, offers her an apple.  They talk for a while, and all the while Joe gets closer and closer to Evangeline.  Finally, she takes the apple he offers her as the final curtain falls.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nA teenage girl, Dorothy, lives on a farm in dreary Kansas with her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em dreaming of faraway places (\" Over The Rainbow \"). One day the farmhouse, with Dorothy inside, is swept off by a tornado to Munchkin land in the Land of Oz.  The falling house kills the cruel ruler of the Munchkins, the Wicked Witch of the East.  The Munchkins and the Sorceress of the North greet Dorothy (\" Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead \" and \" Munchkinland \").   The Sorceress tells Dorothy that she will have to go to the Emerald City to ask the great Wizard of Oz to help her return home.

The witch eventually captures Dorothy, and her friends try to rescue her, disguising themselves as ghosts. The witch is not fooled and intends to shrink Dorothy and her friends with a magic potion in her cauldron. When the witch threatens the Scarecrow with fire, Dorothy pushes her into the cauldron, shrinking her away to nothing (\"Ding-Dong!

To help Dorothy get home, the Wizard personally escorts her to his new rocket ship, as everyone waves (\"Over the Rainbow\" (reprise)).",

Gemma Arterton was cast in the role of Rita, a working woman and mother who becomes a union leader amidst the strike, despite the wishes of her husband and children, who feel neglected by her focus on labour issues.\n\nMade in Dagenham opened for previews on 5 October 2014 at the Adelphi Theatre.  It opened on 9 November to mixed but generally positive reviews.  Despite the good reception, it closed on 11 April 2015, due to poor ticket sales.",
        "synopsis": "### Act One\n\nThe show sets the scene of the O\u2019Grady household. The house relies on Rita O\u2019Grady, a busy working mother, looking after everything whilst her husband, Eddie barely struggles to remember their anniversary (\u201cBusy Woman\u201d). Their son Graham is being caned at school and their daughter, Sharon, wants to be a doctor though Rita quickly points out women are only nurses. Eddie and Rita work at Ford's Dagenham River Plant , a large bustling industrial site home to 5,000 men and 200 women (\u201cMade in Dagenham\u201d). The men build the cars, whilst the women work as seamstresses on the upholstery for the seats. The women discover that they're to be re-graded as unskilled workers, reducing their pay, and raise their objections to their union leaders Connie and Monty (\u201cThis is what we want\u201d). Monty is discussing their objections in the union office at the plant when Jeremy Hopkins, the factory manager enters. He pressures Monty to confuse the girls by asking them to register a formal grievance. The girls agree to register a grievance - selecting Rita to represent them (\u201cWossname\u201d).\n\nMeanwhile, in Westminster, the Prime Minister Harold Wilson is being briefed on the depressing state of the economy and the high rates of industrial unrest (\u201cAlways A Problem\u201d). \u00a0To tackle the problem he selects Barbara Castle , Minister for Transport, to become Secretary of State for Talking to the Unions.\n\nBack in Dagenham it's Friday night in the social club (\u201cPayday\u201d) and tensions are running high as the men confront the girls about not accepting a re-grading. After a confrontation Rita storms out of the pub, as the girls remind Eddie he's forgotten it's their 10th wedding anniversary - sending him running after her (\u201cI'm Sorry I Love You\u201d).\n\nRita goes into school to confront Mr Buckton about his caning of her son Graham. After a patronising interaction with Mr Buckton she bumps into Lisa Hopkins in the corridor and the two bond over their hatred of Mr Buckton's caning, with Lisa Hopkins suggesting they start a petition. Lisa Hopkins is married to Jeremy Hopkins, the manager of the plant.\n\nAs Rita starts to get more involved with union politics, Connie shares her experiences (\u201cSame Old Story\u201d) and urges Rita to go beyond objecting to re-grading and instead asking for equal pay between genders. At a meeting between union leaders and plant management, Rita asks for equal pay - a request that's laughed at. She returns to the plant and the girls vote unanimously for a strike, and Rita finds Eddie, Sharon and Graham as the kids tell her that Eddie made them chips on toast (\u201cEverybody Out\u201d).\n\n### Act Two\n\nFord America parachutes in their brash and arrogant executive Mr Tooley to resolve the strike (\u201cThis is America\u201d). He tells Hopkins to stop the production line and lay all the men off in an attempt to pressure the girls into going back to work (\u201cStorm Clouds\u201d). Lisa tips Rita off that they've offered one of the girls, Sandra, marketing work to try and crack the solidarity of the strike. Rita visits Connie who's been hospitalised with breast cancer. Connie encourages Rita to give the speech she was going to give to the Trade Union Congress . Rita gatecrashes the launch of the Ford Mark II Cortina 1600E to confront Sandra (\u201cCortina\u201d) where she bumps into Barbara, Minister for Transport, who invites her to a meeting in Westminster. When she gets home she's greeted by a letter from Eddie, who's taken the kids away because of the pressure the strike has put on their relationship (\u201cThe Letter\u201d). Lisa arrives to encourage Rita, and offers to lend her a Biba dress for the TUC speech.\n\nThe girls meet Barbara in Westminster (\u201cIdeal World\u201d) who passes on Ford's offer of 92% of the male rate, an offer Rita refuses.\n\nBack at the hospital, Connie has died leaving Rita a copy of the speech for the TUC conference. Eddie confronts Rita about the state of their marriage (\u201cWe Nearly Had It All\u201d), eventually coming round to supporting Rita's strike despite pressure from his male colleagues to \u2018sort her out\u2019.\n\nThe action turns to the TUC Conference (\u201cViva Eastbourne\u201d) where Lisa gives Rita some final words of encouragement before she gives her big speech. Mr Tooley throws a spanner in the works by tearing up the speech and confronting Rita backstage where he tells her that she's just a little girl before stalking off. Rita's friends arrive and give her the confidence to get out onstage and not let Connie down. Rita makes a passionate and heartfelt speech to the conference (\u201cStand Up\u201d) which successfully persuades the TUC to make equal pay a core policy.",

        "title": "Hercules (1997 film)",
        "description": "Hercules is a 1997 American animated musical fantasy comedy film loosely based on the legendary hero Heracles (known in the film by his Roman name, Hercules ), a son of Zeus in Greek mythology . Produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation , the film was directed by John Musker and Ron Clements , both of whom  co-wrote the screenplay with Donald McEnery, Bob Shaw, and Irene Mecchi . Featuring the voices of Tate Donovan , Danny DeVito , James Woods , and Susan Egan , the film follows the titular Hercules , a demigod with super-strength raised among mortals, who must learn to become a true hero in order to earn back his godhood and place in Mount Olympus, while his evil uncle Hades plots his downfall.\n\nDevelopment of Hercules began in 1992 following a pitch adaptation of the Heracles mythological stories by animator Joe Haidar. Meanwhile, Clements and Musker re-developed their idea for Treasure Planet (2002) following the critical and commercial success of Aladdin (1992). Their project was removed from development in 1993, and Musker and Clements joined Hercules later that same year. Following an unused treatment by Haidar, Clements and Musker studied multiple interpretations of Greek mythology before abandoning Zeus 's adulterous affair with Alcmene . The project underwent multiple story treatments and a first script draft was inspired by the screwball comedy films of the classic Hollywood era and popular culture of the 1990s. During production, McEnery, Shaw, and Mecchi were brought on board to revise Musker and Clements' script. British cartoonist Gerald Scarfe was recruited as production designer and produced over seven hundred visualization designs of the characters. Research trips to Greece and Turkey provided inspiration for the background designs. Animation for the film was done in California and Paris. Computer animation was used in several scenes, predominantly in the Hydra battle sequence. The production budget was $85 million.\n\nHercules was released on June 13, 1997, and received generally positive reviews from film critics, with James Woods's performance as Hades receiving particular praise, but the animation (particularly the visual style) and music received a mixed response. The film under-performed in its theatrical release notably in comparison to previous animated Disney films, ultimately earning $252.7\u00a0million in box office revenue worldwide. Hercules was later followed by Hercules: The Animated Series , a syndicated Disney television series focusing on Hercules during his time at the Prometheus Academy, and the direct-to-video prequel Hercules: Zero to Hero (1999), which consists of four episodes from the TV series.",
        "synopsis": "In Ancient Greece , the gods Zeus and Hera have a son named Hercules . While the other gods are joyful, Zeus' wicked brother Hades plots to overthrow Zeus and rule Mount Olympus . Through the Fates , Hades learns that in eighteen years, a planetary alignment will allow him to free the Titans to conquer Olympus, but only if Hercules does not interfere. Hades sends his minions, Pain and Panic , to murder Hercules, providing them with a potion that can strip a god of immortality. The two kidnap the baby and feed him the potion, but a married farmer couple pass nearby, causing the demons to flee before Hercules could drink every last drop; therefore he is only stripped of immortality but retains his god-like strength. The couple adopt Hercules, and Pain and Panic decide not to report their failure to Hades.\n\nYears later, the teenage Hercules becomes an outcast for his inability to control his strength. Wondering about his origins, he decides to visit the Temple of Zeus for answers. There, a statue of Zeus comes to life and reveals all to Hercules, telling him that he can earn back his godhood by becoming a \"true hero.\" Zeus sends Hercules and his forgotten childhood friend Pegasus to the satyr Philoctetes (\"Phil\") who is known for training heroes. After completing the training, Phil and Hercules travel to Thebes , so he can prove himself there as a hero. On the way, they meet Megara (\"Meg\"), a sarcastic damsel whom Hercules saves from the centaur Nessus . Unbeknownst to Hercules, Meg is Hades' slave due to selling her soul to him to save her boyfriend, who eventually left her for another woman. When Meg mentions Hercules to Hades, he realizes Pain and Panic's failure and plots to finish off Hercules properly.\n\nHades stages an accident with the disguised Pain and Panic to lure Hercules into a fight with the Hydra . Hercules defeats the monster, earning the respect and admiration of the Thebans. He defeats many other monsters afterward, each of them sent by Hades, and becomes a celebrated hero. However, Zeus tells him that he is not yet a \"true\" hero but refuses to explain what that means. Saddened and frustrated, Hercules spends a day out with Meg, during which they fall in love with each other. Realizing this, Hades, on the eve of his takeover, holds Meg hostage and offers her freedom in exchange for Hercules surrendering his strength. On the condition that Meg will be unharmed, Hercules accepts but is heartbroken after learning that Meg was working for Hades all along.\n\nHades unleashes the Titans, who defeat the gods on Olympus, while the Cyclops goes to Thebes to kill Hercules. Hercules uses his wits to defeat the Cyclops. During the battle, Meg is mortally injured while saving Hercules from a falling pillar . This breaks Hades's deal, so Hercules regains his strength. Hercules and Pegasus fly to Olympus, free the gods and vanquish the Titans, but Meg dies from her injuries.\n\nTo recover Meg's soul, Hercules goes to the underworld and risks his life by leaping into the River Styx . This act restores his godhood and immortality, so he is able to reach Meg's soul and climb out alive. Hercules punches Hades into the Styx, and he is dragged to its depths by vengeful souls. After  Hercules revives Meg, he is summoned to Olympus, where Zeus and Hera welcome him home, saying he has proven himself a \"true hero\" through the \"strength of his heart\". However, rather than joining the gods, Hercules chooses to remain with Meg, living on Earth as a demigod. Returning to Thebes, they watch Zeus form a constellation in Hercules' honor, much to Phil's happiness.",

Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice, who tells him he is cute, making Rudolph fly. While celebrating with the other bucks, Rudolph's fake nose pops off, causing the other reindeer to mock him and Coach Comet to expel him.\n\nRudolph meets and joins Hermey, a misfit elf who left Santa's workshop to follow his dream to become a dentist , and Yukon Cornelius, a prospector who has been searching for silver and gold throughout his life. After escaping the Abominable Snow Monster , the trio land on the Island of Misfit Toys. It is a place where unloved or unwanted toys reside with their ruler, a winged lion named King Moonracer, who brings the toys to the island until he can find homes and children who would love them. The king allows them to stay the night on the island and asks them for Santa's help in finding homes for the toys. Rudolph leaves on his own that night, worried that his nose will endanger his friends.\n\nTime passes and Rudolph, now a young stag, returns home to find that his parents and Clarice have been searching for him. He travels to the Abominable's cave, where they are being held captive. Rudolph attempts to rescue Clarice until the monster knocks him out with a stalactite .  Hermey and Yukon arrive, intent on rescuing Rudolph. Hermey lures the monster out of the cave and pull out the Abominable's teeth after Yukon uses a falling boulder to knock him out. Yukon then drives the toothless monster back, over a cliffside but falls in with it.\n\nAfter Rudolph, Hermey, Clarice, and the Donners return home, everyone apologizes to Rudolph and Hermey for their behavior. To everyone's surprise, Yukon returns with a tamed Abominable, now trained to trim a Christmas tree, explaining that the monster's bouncing ability saved their lives. As everybody celebrates the arrival of Christmas Eve, Santa announces that a major snowstorm will force him to cancel Christmas, but he reconsiders after noticing Rudolph's bright red nose. Rudolph leads the sleigh, with their first stop being the Island of Misfit Toys, so that Santa can deliver them to the children.",

(Shoved on stage to do or die, she throws the tomatoes back at the hecklers.) She joins a touring theatrical troupe owned and managed by handsome but pompous Mike Farrington. Veteran actress Miss Julia Gibbs takes Pearl under her wing, as does Timmy Timmons, another member of the troupe. Farrington starts her off by putting her in charge of costumes and giving her walk-ons. Unable to suppress her natural rambunctiousness on stage, Pearl resorts to tying her hands together under an apron. Mike and Pearl fall in love, but neither confesses it. In a South Sea melodrama, Pearl is drenched with cold water, and shivers and sneezes so badly that she can't speak. Farrington berates and insults her; Pearl reads him the riot act and walks out. Julia follows her.\n\nPearl auditions for Julia's agents, singing \" I Wish I Didn't Love You So .\" They like her, but there is no business in summer. The agent offers Julia a \"grande dame\" role in a \"flicker.\" Julia scorns film actors, but her agent points out, \"They always eat!\"\n\nAt the studio, several pictures are being filmed at once. With no advance warning, Julia is barraged with pies. Furious, Pearl storms onto the set and retaliates, then helps her friend walk through several works in progress, shooing a lion out of the way. (She thought it was a dog.) The director, George \"Mac\" McGuire, offers her a  $100 a week contract. \"She's gonna be the biggest thing in pictures!\" he declares. Pearl soon becomes world-famous as the star of the cliffhanging, tied-to-the-railroad-tracks serials known as The Perils of Pauline . Meanwhile, Farrington can't get work; the theaters are showing pictures.\n\nPearl is filming a pursuit alongside a train. She jumps onto a boxcar and meets a hobo: It's Timmy, who promptly joins Pearl's team as a villain. Later, Timmy finds Mike working as a barker in a sideshow. He tells Mike his new boss has a job for him. It is, of course, Pearl, who persuades him to become her leading man. His first lesson is that the kind of melodramatic gestures that he abhorred in Pearl are exactly what is needed in silent film. They are a success.\n\nMcGuire arranges a publicity stunt that sends Pearl and Mike off in a runaway balloon\u2014without the balloonist who was supposed to sneak into the basket. The balloon is caught in a thunderstorm and they cling to each other. He tells her he loves her and promises to marry her.\n\nThe press announcement sidelines Mike, who feels he has lost his identity. His pride can't take it and he calls off the wedding. Then War is declared. Mike and Timmy join the Army; Pearl does benefits and makes war films. After the war ends, Mike comes home to find great success in the theater. Serials are on their way out, and Pearl and Timmy go to Paris to perform in a nightclub there. Farrington can't follow her until his play is over.\n\nAfter 251 performance at the Casino de Paris, Pearl learns that Mike is coming. Elated, she falls during a stunt. The doctors tell her that she must have surgery immediately; even so, it might be one or two years before she can walk again. Instead, she goes to meet Mike. He begs her to marry him and come back to America. When she says she won't leave Paris, he replies that he will come to her. She tells him she doesn't love him anymore. Julia has followed them, and when Mike gets out of the car she beckons to him. A sorrowful Pearl gets Timmy to take her into a theater showing one of their films. Eyes on the screen, she hears Mike's voice saying, \"You always were a rotten actress.\" They embrace, and he carries her out of the theater.",

Sir John tells Sally that she and Bill ought to return to Lambeth, but he is moved by Sally's heartfelt declaration of love for Bill (\"Once You Lose Your Heart\").\n\nAt the party, Bill puts on airs and tries to please his new-found upper-class lawyers, family and servants, but his everyman roots quickly begin to show.  Sally shows up in inappropriate garb, with her Lambeth friends, saying that she is going back to where she belongs. Bill seconds this at first, but then teaches the nobility \" The Lambeth Walk \".\n\nBill must make a speech in the House of Lords in coronet and \"vermin\"-trimmed peer's robes . Sally leaves, telling him to marry someone with good blood, and, in a scene inspired by Gilbert and Sullivan 's Ruddigore , the portraits of Bill's ancestors awaken to remind him of his noblesse oblige . Bill and Sally have gained an ally in Sir John, who offers to help them by engaging a speech professor (implied to be Henry Higgins from Pygmalion ) to help Sally impress the Duchess.\n\nBill constantly bemoans his separation from Sally.  Preparing another party for Bill, the Duchess realises how much Sally means to him.  This puts her in a romantic mood, and she accepts an offer of marriage from Sir John. Bill, dressed in his old outrageous Cockney clothes, declares that he's going home and goes upstairs to pack.  Just then, Sally astonishes everyone by arriving in an elegant gown and tiara and speaking with a perfect upper-crust accent. When Bill returns downstairs, Sally conceals her identity; when she reveals it, Bill is relieved and the couple gain the acceptance of the family.",

        "description": "Teeth is a musical by Michael R. Jackson and Anna K. Jacobs , adapted from the 2007 horror film of the same name. It premiered off-Broadway in 2024 at Playwrights Horizons .\n\nThe musical follows Dawn O'Keefe, an evangelical teenager, who is navigating the challenges of adolescent dating and chastity when she discovers she has teeth in her vagina .",
        "synopsis": "\"Pastor\", the leader of a congregation in the town of Eden, leads a sermon preaching against premarital sex , following the recent case of teenage pregnancy involving Amy Sue and her boyfriend Brock. His stepdaughter, Dawn O'Keefe, leads the \"Promise Keeper Girls\" in reiterating their abstinence pledge , insisting that their vaginas are \"a precious gift\" that must be protected until marriage (\"Precious Gift\"). Her stepbrother, Brad, rejects both Pastor and Dawn's attempts to get him more involved in the church. He joins the Truthseekers, a virtual group of men's rights activists led by the mysterious \"Godfather\", and tells of an incident between him and Dawn when they were young in which he fingered her and received a cut (\"Between Her Thighs\"). Dawn meets with her boyfriend, Tobey, and the pair express their love for each other, with the latter claiming he loves her most for her modesty (\"Modest is Hottest\"). However, Dawn struggles with her temptation to break her chastity vow, as she has been taught since birth to consider her sexual urges evil (\"Shame in My Body\").\n\nPastor catches Brad masturbating upon the instructions of Godfather and beats him (\"A Real Man\"). Tobey meets with Dawn and reveals he is not actually a virgin as he previously had sexual intercourse with his girlfriend Denise at his previous school. Dawn, intrigued by the idea that Tobey has had sexual experiences, encourages him to share a fantasy he has of her and the two nearly consummate their relationship (\"Playing With Fire\"), but they are interrupted by fellow congregation member Ryan. Dawn summons the Promise Keeper Girls, who shame her, but she is defended by Ryan. The girls try to criticize Ryan as well due to him being gay : Ryan freely admits to this but claims despite his sins he is able to be born again, and they too can be forgiven for straying from the path (\"Born Again\"). The congregation decides to have Pastor re-baptize them in the morning. Dawn goes to Tobey to tell him of these plans, but he claims he cannot wait: they go into a lake and perform the baptism ritual themselves, before Tobey proposes to her and, in the rush of emotions, begin having sex (\"When She Gave Birth\"). However, Tobey starts becoming aggressive and ignores Dawn's pleas to stop. Dawn's vagina abruptly cuts off Tobey's penis and leaves him, dead, floating in the lake. Unbeknownst to Dawn, Brad witnessed everything.\n\nThe other Promise Keeper Girls have a vision of a mysterious female god, which they sense has been awakened in a vessel near to them. After Tobey's body is found, Pastor gathers the Promise Keeper Girls at the church, claiming an evil has awakened and sets off to find Dawn. The girls feel changes in their body as they sense whatever has awakened takes the form of teeth, while Brad leads the Truthseekers in believing the fall of man is upon them (\"Teeth\"). Ryan finds Dawn at her house while Brad and Pastor are out, and after learning what happened recommends she see a gynecologist outside of town. Dawn thinks back to her teachings and decides she, along with her late mother Kim, were punished simply for being women (\"Always the Woman\"). Brad confronts Dawn and tries to remind her of the incident from their childhood, but is stopped by Pastor. Before Brad leaves, he crudely tells Dawn that Pastor never had sexual intercourse with Kim \u2014 Pastor freely confesses to this, saying that Kim was \"impure\" because of her past (\"Shame in My Body (reprise)\"). Dawn elects to visit the gynecologist, Dr. Godfrey, who is initially sympathetic but reveals predatory tendencies during his examination (\"Girls Like You\") that result in Dawn cutting off his hand with her \"teeth\", causing him to bleed to death, but not before identifying her condition as vagina dentata . Dawn runs to Ryan, revealing she now remembers the incident with Brad and realizes she has had the \"teeth\" since birth. Ryan searches on the dark web for information on \"vagina dentata\". He, along with Brad and the Truthseekers, find a wiki revealing information on Dentata, an ancient goddess with teeth in her vagina. They realize that Dawn has become a vessel for Dentata, and supposedly the only way to defeat her is for a hero to have sex with her and cure her (\"According to the Wiki\"). Ryan reveals this to Dawn and offers to have sex with her, suggesting it will cure her of her dentition and him of his homosexuality (\"I'm Your Guy\"). The two have consensual sex and Dawn's \"teeth\" do not engage, but Ryan reveals he was secretly live-streaming the encounter to prove to the world he is no longer gay.\n\nThe trauma of her experiences finally causes Dawn to snap (\"When She Gave Birth (Reprise)\"), as she fully embraces the goddess Dentata's possession and seduces Ryan into having sex again before cutting off his penis. She leads the Promise Keeper Girls, now worshipers of Dentata and having grown their own \"teeth\", in attacking Pastor as revenge for his teachings, emasculating him. Brad declares himself the hero of the Truthseekers and that he will defeat Dawn, before killing Pastor by setting him on fire . He leads the Truthseekers in trying to fight \"the feminocracy\" but they all get their penises cut off by the Promise Keeper Girls (\"Dentata\"). Dawn and Brad face off in a final showdown, accusing each other of being their \"monster\" and the source of their pain before engaging in ritualistic sex (\"Take Me Down (Part 1)\") but Dawn emerges victorious, cutting off Brad's penis. Having taken over Eden, the Dentata worshipers promise to take over the rest of the Bible Belt and the rest of the world, threatening the audience to beware of their \"teeth\" (\"Take Me Down (Part 2)\").",

        "description": "In the Heights is a musical with concept, music, and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a book by Quiara Alegr\u00eda Hudes . The story is a romance as well as a celebration of community , culture , and aspirations. It is set over the course of three days, involving characters in the largely Dominican American neighborhood of Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan , New York City . The score blends hip-hop , salsa , merengue , and soul .\n\nAfter a 2005 tryout in Waterford, Connecticut and a 2007 Off-Broadway run, the show opened on Broadway in March 2008. It was nominated for thirteen Tony Awards and won four, including Best Musical . A film adaptation of the musical was released in June 2021.",
        "synopsis": "### Act 1\n\nAs the sun rises on the hottest day of the summer, Usnavi de la Vega, the owner of a small bodega in Washington Heights , chases away a small-time vandal, Graffiti Pete, before introducing the audience to the corner he lives on and some of its many residents: Abuela Claudia, an elderly Cuban immigrant who raised Usnavi after the death of his parents; Sonny, Usnavi's younger cousin who works in the bodega ; Daniela and Carla, who own the local salon; Kevin and Camila Rosario, a married couple who own the cab company; Benny, Usnavi's longtime best friend and an employee at the cab company; and Vanessa, an employee at the salon and aspiring fashion designer (\"In the Heights\").\n\nAs the day begins, the Rosarios' daughter, Nina, arrives home from her first year at Stanford University . Often considered the \"one who made it out\" and the pride of the corner, Nina dreads telling her parents and neighbors the truth of her return home: that she dropped out of Stanford because she had to work two jobs to maintain her tuition , leading to her getting poor grades and losing her scholarship (\"Breathe\"). As she tries to find her parents to tell them the news, she runs into Benny. Clearly harboring latent romantic feelings for one another, Benny and Nina reconnect (\"Benny's Dispatch\").\n\nElsewhere, Vanessa dreams of one day leaving the corner and getting an apartment in the West Village (\"It Won't Be Long Now\"). While she is on a break at the salon, Sonny asks her out on a date on Usnavi's behalf, and she accepts; Usnavi rejoices at his success, as he has been in love with Vanessa for years. However, he worries that Vanessa may forget about him and the rest of the community when she moves.\n\nNina reunites with her parents and is ultimately forced to reveal that she dropped out. Her parents are stunned at this revelation, as well as her dishonesty. Kevin grows devastated that he has been unable to provide for his family, fearing that he has continued the cycle started by his father, a poor tenant farmer (\"In\u00fatil\"). Nina goes to the salon to seek comfort from Vanessa, but Daniela and Carla insist on giving Nina a makeover and subjecting her to their gossip about the happenings in the neighborhood, specifically regarding Benny and Usnavi. Daniela, Carla, and Vanessa then praise Nina and her successes. Nina reluctantly reveals to them that she dropped out, then leaves exasperatedly. (\"No Me Diga\").\n\nAs Usnavi closes up shop, he, Benny, Sonny, and Graffiti Pete discover that the bodega has sold a winning lottery ticket worth $96,000. The news gets out and the entire block begins to fantasize about what they would do if they had that much money (\"96,000\"). After the excitement dissipates, Abuela Claudia sits down to feed the birds and reminisces about her childhood in Cuba and her life in relative poverty, and the events that have led her to where she is today. She reveals that she holds the winning lottery ticket, and expresses gratitude for her patience and faith (\"Paciencia y Fe\").\n\nBenny comforts Nina by walking with her and discussing their memories of growing up in the neighborhood. Nina expresses her doubts about her own self-worth to Benny, but he reassures her that she is destined for greatness (\"When You're Home\"). As they head to Nina's house for dinner, the local piragua merchant (referred to in the script as \"Piragua Guy\") pushes his food cart through the neighborhood, but all of his prospective customers would rather buy frozen treats from a nearby Mister Softee truck (\"Piragua\").\n\nKevin and Camila host Nina, Benny, Usnavi, Vanessa, and Abuela Claudia for dinner, where Kevin announces that he has sold the car service to pay for Nina's tuition. Nina and Camila are shocked. Benny, who had been dreaming of eventually managing the car service, is outraged and confronts Kevin over his decision. Kevin insists that Rosario's is a family business, and he does not consider Benny to be part of his family. Benny is furious and abruptly leaves. Nina, refusing to accept Kevin's money, follows Benny.\n\nUsnavi soon arrives at a local nightclub for his date with Vanessa, but is overly nervous and aloof. Vanessa begins dancing with other men, aiming to make Usnavi jealous. In response, Usnavi dances with another woman as an attempt to make Vanessa jealous. Nina follows Benny to the club to apologize for Kevin's decision. Benny, already drunk, angrily brushes her off. Tensions rise in the club as the two couples cope with their own jealousy, culminating in Benny punching a man dancing with Nina, causing a fight to break out (\"The Club\"). Suddenly, the power goes out throughout the city as a result of the intense heat and humidity. The neighborhood descends into chaos as Usnavi and Vanessa, as well as Benny and Nina, desperately try to find their way back to one another. Sonny and Graffiti Pete, fearing looters , set off fireworks to distract potential robbers as well as to light everyone else's way home. Usnavi reunites with Abuela Claudia, who reveals her lottery ticket to him. Benny and Nina find each other amid the chaos, and despite initially arguing, they finally kiss (\"Blackout\").\n\n### Act 2\n\nKevin spends the night searching for Nina, who is spending the night with Benny in Benny's apartment. Benny worries about whether Kevin will approve of him dating Nina, but is happy to spend time with Nina regardless (\"Sunrise\"). Usnavi's bodega has been robbed. Usnavi convenes with Abuela Claudia to discuss what will happen with the money. Abuela Claudia decides to give Sonny and Usnavi each a third of the money and urges Usnavi to use his money to achieve his lifelong dream of returning to his home in the Dominican Republic . While Usnavi shares some doubts, he eventually decides to go (\"Hundreds of Stories\"). Nina eventually returns home, and discovers her parents have been frantically searching for her. Kevin grows furious when he learns Nina was with Benny and disapproves of their relationship, partially because he wants Nina to date a Latino man, which Benny is not. Nina and Kevin loudly argue before Camila intervenes, criticizing Kevin for throwing Benny out and Nina for not coming home. She urges them to come together and work things out as a family (\"Enough\").\n\nAs the neighborhood copes with their frustration over the heat and blackout, Daniela urges them to dispel the negativity and muster up enough energy for a neighborhood celebration. Daniela leads the crowd in playfully teasing Vanessa for not realizing Usnavi's feelings for her, and Benny for his tryst with Nina the previous night. Usnavi arrives and announces that Abuela Claudia had won the lottery, and that he has booked a flight for the Dominican Republic, which will leave the following day. Vanessa is visibly upset by the news of Usnavi's impending departure. Sonny is upset by that news and the news of Nina's relationship with Benny, as Sonny had a crush on Nina himself. Usnavi calms Sonny down by revealing that he and Abuela Claudia are giving him third of the lottery winnings. Usnavi encourages the neighborhood residents to celebrate before everything changes (\"Carnaval del Barrio\").\n\nDuring the celebration, Nina arrives and pulls Usnavi offstage. Kevin makes an announcement over the dispatch: Abuela Claudia has suddenly died (\"Atenci\u00f3n\"). Usnavi holds an impromptu memorial for Abuela Claudia, revealing that she died of \"a combination of the stress and heat,\" and Nina leads the entire block in mourning Abuela Claudia (\"Alabanza\"). Afterward, Usnavi and Nina go through Abuela's old photographs to reminisce. Nina begins to remember the central role Abuela Claudia played in her education and motivation, and in memory of Abuela, she resolves to accept her parents' money and give college another try, returning to Stanford at the end of the summer (\"Everything I Know\"). As Vanessa prepares to move out, Daniela gives her a final piece of news: Usnavi convinced Daniela to cosign Vanessa's lease for her new apartment (\"No Me Diga (Reprise)\"). As the blackout continues, many neighborhood residents patronize the Piragua Guy, partially because the Mister Softee truck broke down; the Piragua Guy is overjoyed to finally have good business (\"Piragua (Reprise)\").\n\nOverwhelmed by his kind act, Vanessa visits Usnavi as he cleans up the bodega. She flirts with him and offers him a bottle of champagne. She quietly suggests to him that he should stay in the neighborhood, saying that if he leaves, she will never see him again. Usnavi, overwhelmed, firmly decides to leave. Vanessa kisses him, lamenting that she was too late in realizing her feelings for him (\"Champagne\"). As Nina tells Benny of her decision, they agree to spend the summer together before pursuing a long-distance relationship when she returns to school; Benny reaffirms his faith in her, and they promise to keep contacting each other (\"When The Sun Goes Down\"). Benny confronts Kevin for a final time, insisting that he was always there for him while Kevin never did the same. As the night winds down, Sonny approaches Graffiti Pete with a secret proposition, which Pete accepts.\n\nThe next morning, the neighborhood has visibly changed: the car service sign over the Rosarios' building has been removed, and the grate in front of the bodega is still open. As Usnavi listens to Abuela Claudia's old records , he accepts that the neighborhood has changed and wonders if any of his neighbors in Washington Heights will miss him after he leaves. Sonny approaches Usnavi and, having fixed the bodega's grate, pulls it down, revealing a graffiti mural of Abuela Claudia painted by Pete. Seeing the mural, Usnavi has an epiphany and tells Sonny and Pete to inform the neighborhood that he is not leaving. As he reflects on his role as the neighborhood's storyteller, Usnavi ponders a potential future with Vanessa, declares he will commit himself to protecting the legacy of his family (as well as Abuela Claudia), and accepts Washington Heights as his true home (\"Finale\").",

        "title": "KPOP (musical)",
        "description": "KPOP is a Broadway musical with a book by Jason Kim and music and lyrics by Helen Park and Max Vernon . The musical originally premiered off-Broadway at Ars Nova in Manhattan in September 2017.",
        "synopsis": "Although the Broadway production of KPOP features many of the songs and characters from the off-Broadway production, the two versions follow distinctly different plots: the Broadway production has been characterized by the creative team as being more of a \"reinvention\" than a transfer of the off-Broadway version.\n\n### Off-Broadway (2017)\n\nThe show casts audiences as American executives touring JTM Entertainment, a K-pop music factory run by Moon and his wife Ruby, who are trying to break into the North American market with the help of a Korean American agent named Jerry. Audience members toured the multilevel, multiroom facility where they observe rehearsals by the bands F8 and Special K, as well as JTM's flagship star MwE. Audiences also encounter the in-house plastic surgeon Dr. Park, the vocal coach Yazmeen, and a ruthless dance instructor named Jenn. Throughout the evening, the audience observes as the JTM artists as they are put through the wringer of the idol industry, from demanding rehearsals, to cultivating fandom via social media, to receiving media training, and having to confront body dysmorphia through a rhinoplasty examination to find any facial imperfections. Specific plotlines include Korean-American member Epic trying to embrace the attempt to break into American pop culture against the wishes of other members of F8, and MwE facing the possibility of being replaced as JTM's star by Sonoma, one of the younger members in the group Special K.\n\n### Broadway (2022)\n\nThe show is framed as a camera rehearsal for South Korean music agency RBY Entertainment\u2019s New York debut of its stars, at Circle in the Square Theatre on Broadway. RBY\u2019s founder and chief executive, a former K-pop singer named Ruby, discusses logistics with the director Harry as she rehearses the introduction. The two groups, RTMIS and F8, perform the opening number with the song \"This is My Korea \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc774\uc57c\uae30.\" RBY\u2019s main star, MwE, starts to perform her song \"\uc5ce\ub4dc\ub824 Up Du Ryuh (Bow Down)\" but becomes spooked upon seeing Ruby in the audience and flees.\n\nWhile Ruby goes to confront MwE, Harry has F8 rehearse their introductions to the camera, but finds their simple introductions in Korean boring. New member Brad, a mixed race Korean-American who replaced another member, tries to make his mark by coming up with a hammy intro in English, but quickly comes into conflict with the rest of the group over whether to introduce themselves in Korean or English, particularly bandleader Jun Hyuk. F8 performs their song \"\ud55c\uad6d\ub188 Han Guk Nom (Korean Man)\" but intentionally change up the choreography on Brad as revenge for his outburst. Harry begins using the cameras to spy on Ruby, MwE, and MwE\u2019s boyfriend Juny in the dressing room. MwE reveals she thought she saw her mother in the audience, and with Juny\u2019s encouragement voices that she wishes to quit RBY.\n\nThe action flashes back to MwE\u2019s original audition for RBY, as 9-year old Mina Kim, as she performs \"Still I Love You \uc544\uc9c1\ub3c4 \uc0ac\ub791\ud574\", explaining that she wishes to become a singer to support her mother after her father left. Ruby, the original singer of the song, sees potential in MwE and immediately signs her on. In the present, Harry sees an opportunity to turn the concert film into a documentary about the K-pop industry. He tries to get RTMIS, the girl group, to spill on their careers in B-roll as they rehearse their song \"Perfect \uc644\ubcbd\ud55c \uac78.\" The group refuses, as all interviews need to be vetted by Ruby, and they face severe consequences if anything they say affects the image of RBY\u2019s brand.\n\nIn another flashback, a 13-year old MwE struggles to get through a dance rehearsal for her song \"Wind Up Doll \ud0dc\uc5fd\uc778\ud615\" after her mother abandoned her on her recent birthday. Ruby encourages her to push through the pain of her home life and focus on the image she shows to the rest of the world. In the present, Brad asks Harry to redo the footage for \"Han Guk Nom\". Harry pushes him to spill on the rest of the group bullying him. Brad is reluctant, but eventually relates his personal experiences growing up as the child of a Korean mother and being bullied in school for his identity, and how his treatment by the rest of F8 reminds him of that. Harry has Brad perform an original song he wrote inspired by his experiences, \"Halfway \uc911\uac04 \uc9c0\uc810\". In another flashback, backstage at a performance, 18-year old MwE confronts Ruby over the slow progress in her career and the fact that Ruby has begun recruiting for a new boy band (F8), interpreting it as Ruby gearing up to replace her. Ruby reminds her that the path to stardom takes a long time, but it will be worth it in the end. As MwE performs \"\uc288\ud3b4\uc2a4\ud0c0 Super Star\" she sees crowds of fans cheering for her.\n\nRTMIS performs \"\uc2dc\uac04 \ub0ad\ube44 Shi Gan Nang Bee (Waste of Time)\", a song about ending relationships. Harry once again asks them about filming B-roll, only for Ruby to intervene and remind Harry it is forbidden. In a flashback to three months before the rehearsal, MwE writes a song \"\ubc99\uc5b4\ub9ac\uc0c8 Bung Uh Ree Sae (Mute Bird)\" with her childhood friend and boyfriend Juny, in response to the recent death of her mother. He encourages her to record it, as it is different from the pre-written material Ruby makes her do. A talented musician himself, Juny prefers his simple life as a music teacher to MwE\u2019s busy touring schedules, and they are only able to meet for short periods at a time and in secrecy. MwE, desperate to keep Juny in her life, proposes to him just as Ruby walks in. A scandalized Ruby reminds MwE that she has a specific brand to follow, and Juny does not fit that brand. MwE refuses to keep working for RBY if Juny can\u2019t be present, so Ruby reluctantly allows him to join her on tour on the condition Ruby also manages every aspect of his daily life.\n\nThe tensions among F8 come to a head as they prepare to rehearse \"Amerika (Checkmate) \uc544\uba54\ub9ac\uce74\" particularly when Harry has the cameras focus on Brad. Jun Hyuk finally explodes that he feels Brad has not earned his place among the group, most of whom have had to train for years whereas Brad was hired to replace one of their friends without going through the same training. Brad retorts that he was hired for his talent, same as the rest of the group, and that they have only excluded him because of his American identity and poor grasp on the Korean language. Jae Ik admits that Brad has a point, and points out that Jun Hyuk can\u2019t fault Brad for being American, as several members of the group are also from America (including Jae Ik himself, hailing from Queens ). The other members accuse Harry of trying to push conflict for his documentary, and encourage Jun Hyuk and Brad to make-up before they rehearse the song.\n\nIn a flashback to a week before the camera rehearsal, MwE tries to get Ruby to listen to the song she wrote, but Ruby refuses to market MwE as a singer-songwriter. MwE begins expressing doubts about making her debut in New York as RTMIS arrives to rehearse. Ruby tells RTMIS that if MwE refuses to perform, the whole performance will be cancelled. Several members of RTMIS start voicing frustration that the work they have put into their careers could be thrown away so easily. One of the members, Sonoma, reminds the rest of the group how important getting to perform alongside one of their idols, MwE, will be, and that they must put in the effort to fulfill their lifelong dreams.\n\nJust as Ruby and MwE\u2019s argument backstage hits a breaking point, they finally notice the camera operator and discover Harry\u2019s scheme. Ruby promptly fires Harry, who protests he could have helped MwE by making her human to the rest of the world, instead of the machine Ruby has made her. Faced with what her life has become, MwE declares that she wants to quit and leave with Juny. Ruby apologizes for not being encouraging or a strong replacement for her mother, but reminds her cancelling the whole performance would jeopardize the careers of everyone at RBY, including the members of F8 and RTMIS. MwE suggests Juny could come with her, but he refuses, reiterating that he can\u2019t live the rigorous, controlled touring life, and they will have to end the relationship if she stays with RBY. Ruby, softened by the entire ordeal, offers MwE two options on the condition that she performs at least one more time: to stay with the company, or leave and try to live a normal life with Juny. MwE\u2019s decision is left ambiguous.\n\nRather than film the performance, Ruby turns RBY\u2019s planned debut in New York City into a concert, featuring performances by RTMIS (\"Supergoddess \uc288\ud37c\uac00\ub514\uc2a4\" and \"Gin & Tonic \uc9c4 \uc564 \ud1a0\ub2c9\"), F8 (\"Meant 2 B \uba58 \ud22c \ube44\" and \"\ud754\ub4e4\uc5b4 Hun Du Ruh (Shake It)\"), and MwE (\"Phoenix \ubd88\uc0ac\uc870\"). Finally, all of the RBY artists come together to perform \"Blast Off \ubc1c\uc0ac\".",

After takeoff, Captain Tempest converses with the ship's new Science Officer, who is a woman, and they argue about the importance of men and women on earth. During their argument, the ship gets caught in a meteor shower. The Science Officer suggests that they use the shuttle craft and abandon ship, but Captain Tempest insists on flying through the storm. During the confusion, the Science Officer escapes the ship via shuttle craft. Their spaceship is drawn mysteriously to the planet D'Illyria where the crew meet mad scientist Doctor Prospero, who has been marooned on the planet since his wife and science partner Gloria sent him and their daughter Miranda into space. Doctor Prospero offers to help repair the broken starship and he, his daughter, and their robot Ariel come aboard. The ship's cook, Cookie, is instantly taken by Miranda's beauty and falls in love with her, a love he thinks she returns. In fact she has fallen in love with Captain Tempest, against the will of her father. During discussions about locating the missing Science Officer, Ariel reveals information about Doctor Prospero's new formula 'X Factor\u2019, which can enhance the brain and mind. After an argument with his daughter over her love for the captain, Doctor Prospero takes the draught of 'X Factor'. Soon afterwards, the ship is attacked by a foul monster, but during the attack it is revealed that Ariel is in the airlock with the missing Science Officer. To save them both, Captain Tempest orders the airlock opened, which allows the monster to gain access to the ship. During the confusion of the attack it is revealed that the Science Officer is Doctor Prospero's wife Gloria, who is then taken by the monster, as its tentacles attack the rest of the ship.\n\n### Act 2\n\nThe story continues with the attack unfolding again, but this time Gloria isn't kidnapped by the monster, and Ariel the robot is able to attack the monster to make it retreat. After the attack, more is revealed about Doctor Prospero and Gloria's past. Captain Tempest puts Gloria under ship arrest for her crimes against her husband. She forms a quick alliance with Cookie, whom she persuades to release her and help steal the recipe for Doctor Prospero's 'X Factor' in exchange for helping him win over Miranda's heart. Gloria talks to Cookie, as Bosun, the ship's First Mate, talks to Captain Tempest about how to gain the love of Miranda. When the monster returns, it is revealed that it is created by Doctor Prospero's mind due to his having taken the 'X Factor'. Gloria tells Doctor Prospero that what she did to him was so that he could keep himself and their daughter safe from the 'X Factor'. Doctor Prospero has no choice but to leave the ship and sacrifice himself to save the others. Once Doctor Prospero has left, it is then revealed that D'Illyria is nothing other than a figment of Doctor Prospero's imagination, as it starts to destroy itself once the doctor has died. The ship escapes.  Once again in space Gloria blesses the union of Miranda and Captain Tempest, and Cookie is pardoned for his behaviour towards Miranda and Captain Tempest. The show ends with the crew safe and well with their Science Officer back and Captain Tempest with a new bride.",

        "synopsis": "### Act I\n\nA teenage couple living on the run are almost discovered by a cop. Together, they kill her, and after disposing of the body in a nearby bin, turn to each other and begin a duet about their eternal love and devotion (\"Let Them\"). The couple are interrupted when Caroline, single mother and nurse , yells for her fourteen-year-old daughter Edna to come join her for dinner. It turns out that the girl from the couple is not in fact a fugitive, but Edna, a 14-year-old girl in the midst of an involved fantasy. Annoyed, Edna gets out of coming to dinner by insisting that she needs to study so she can keep her scholarship .\n\nA global community of fans appear. They are all united in their love of the same pop star: a young man simply known as Harry. As it turns out, the boy in Edna's fantasy is the eighteen-year-old heartthrob-in-chief of True Connection, the biggest boyband in the world. The global fans sing about their love for Harry, but Edna believes that she is the only one who can truly see the 'real' him \"hiding in plain sight\". Edna believes that Harry is being forced by his management to take drugs like \" Britney Spears \" was to keep him in the band and is desperate for a way out of his life as a pop star (\"Nobody\").\n\nIn the school locker rooms, Edna meets up with her two best friends Jules and Brianna. Jules is hyper-focused on gaining a boyfriend, and Brianna is worried that nobody thinks she looks hot. After a fight with her best friend Jules in which Jules calls Edna \"crazy\" for thinking she'll end up with Harry, Edna is left alone after being ditched by both Jules and Brianna. Edna laments her changing friendship with Jules and Brianna, and sings of her determination to meet Harry and set him free in order to prove that everyone is wrong about her (\"Wait and See\").\n\nOver dinner, Caroline tries to warn Edna against wasting her potential by spending so much time online obsessing over Harry. Annoyed, Edna excuses herself to go any do more \"homework\" in her room. Edna then logs on to a Fan Fiction forum to talk to her online best friend Saltypringl. In an attempt to cheer Edna up, Salty shares two of their juicy new stories (\"Feels So True\"). Edna asks Salty if her fanfiction about killing the cop is too \"crazy\", but Salty insists that it's perfect, and is, in fact \"psychic\". Salty goes on to explain that some fans have broken into Harry's hotel room and discovered an empty sheet of antidepressants in the trash, which confirms Edna's theory that Harry is secretly depressed. Edna resolves that information is the sign that she must now find a way to meet Harry in person and save him (\"Set You Free\").\n\nThe very next morning, True Connection announce new tour dates, including a stop in Edna's home town (\"The Announcement\"). Across Australia , fans express their outrage at the ticket prices of the concerts. Meanwhile, Edna begs her mother to buy a ticket for her, while Caroline explains they cannot afford it. At school, Brianna tells Jules that her parents have also refused to buy her a ticket, meaning Jules will be going alone with her mum. The girls despair, and Jules pushes Edna to come up with a way for them all to go. Desperate, Edna pressures Jules to blackmail her rich mother into purchasing tickets for all three of them, and weaponises something Jules confessed to her and Brianna previously; that Jules' mother is trying to buy her love during her parents' acrimonious divorce. Jules phones her mum and threatens to expose her mother's previously secret affair unless she gives in. With assurances of tickets coming, the girls are elated (\"Actually Dead\").\n\nAssured that she has a ticket to the concert, Edna realises this is her destined chance to meet Harry, if only she can find a way to be alone with him at the concert. She contacts Saltypringl and asks them for help with \"a story\" in which a fan meets Harry at a True Connection concert. She explains she has figured out how her character will get to the concert, but is not sure how she could get Harry alone. Salty proposes an extreme plan, which Edna considers, but while ultimately dismissing it, is struck by new inspiration. In a fantasy, she imagines meeting Harry at the concert. She realises that she could pass him a note on stage that gives him instructions for how to meet her and run away together.\u00a0Secretly, Edna resolves to carry out this story in real life (\"Got No Chill\").\n\nEdna arrives at school to discover that Jules has betrayed her and has only purchased one extra concert ticket; for Brianna. Knowing the concert is sold out and that scalped tickets are now going for a thousand dollars each, Edna is left with no way to see Harry. Betrayed, Edna runs off, ending her friendship with Jules and Brianna. Months pass, and Edna spirals into despair while Jules cruelly talks about the upcoming concert. Caroline grows concerned about Edna's obvious depression, and begs her to open up. Edna lashes out at Caroline, questioning why she even became a mother in the first place if she \"couldn't afford it\". Hurt, but concerned about her daughter, Caroline explains to Edna that she had her because she loves her, but leaves the room, devastated. Left alone, Edna appears with a coil of rope and unlabelled household chemicals in hand (\"Don't Exist\")\n\nOn the night of concert, Jules and Brianna get ready at Jules' house; Brianna is hopeful that the photos she takes that night will transform her image and people will finally think she's hot. Jules hopes that she will somehow find a boyfriend in the crowd. Brianna confesses some guilt that they aren't including Edna, but Jules explains that they needed to ditch Edna because her immaturity was \"holding them back\". Meanwhile, at home, Edna holds her coil of rope and focuses on how \"sorry\" everyone is about to be (\"Night of our Lives\").\n\nJules and Brianna leave the stadium post concert, overwhelmed and sobbing with joy. At the same time, in Edna's bedroom, we learn why she's collected the rope and chemicals: in her room she has a blindfolded, bound, and gagged Harry (\"The Reveal\").\n\n### Act II\n\nAct two opens with a vibrant, bopping set of songs which the audience can scream and shout to, including front-row fans Yael, Georgia, and Siobhan, who throw roses at Harry and yell at other fans who try to get his attention ( \"Concert Medley\" and \"Nobody (Acoustic)\").\n\nWe jump back in time to see Edna remove Harry's gag for the first time, but is overwhelmed by the sight of him in person, and while she is lost for words he cries out for help, so she is forced to chloroform him again to avoid discovery. Across the globe, Harry's fans react to news of his disappearance; vigils are held around the world. Meanwhile, Edna convinces Caroline that she is too sick to go to school and must stay home alone while she works. When Jules reads the news, she is confronted with her own mortality, and doubles down on her quest for a boyfriend. Brianna is moved by the solidarity of the fans and thinks about attending her local vigil (\"Panic\").\n\nIn Edna's room, Harry asks Edna to explain why she kidnapped him. She presents a rehearsed pitch (with notecards) explaining that there was no other way that his management would allow him to leave the band and have his own life, so therefore she is his only way out. She proposes that they run away together, and presents the extensive supplies she has stockpiled for this mission; including rolls of cash, fake IDs, various disguises and a fake baby to help convince people they are a couple. Harry convinces Edna he will run away with her, but as soon as she unties him, pushes her to the ground and makes a run for it. She takes off after him (\"Become Brand New\").\n\nAround the world, fans grow more and more worried about Harry and are beginning to start doing very strange things to show their support for him. Salty contacts Edna, and asks for help getting the hashtag #cutforharry banned on Twitter , to prevent self-harm among fans. At work, Caroline grows concerned for Edna when she sees a news story about grieving fans (\"Life or Death\"). At her home, Jules answers a disappointing call from her dad, revealing that in their divorce, she is being left neglected by both parents. In her room, Brianna tries to recreate photos from the night of the concert, after discovering that Jules has thoughtlessly deleted all photos of her from the night to save space on her phone. Edna re-enters her room with Harry, who is now tied to a wheelie chair with an assortment of household cables. In a fight between them, it becomes clear there is no way she will ever convince him to listen to her, let alone run away with her. Harry implores her to call the police, and tells her that she should be disgusted with herself. Between their bedrooms, all three girls reflect on their various fears that they are undesirable and disgusting (\"Disgusting\").\n\nEdna reaches out to Salty asking for help coming up with a new ending for their kidnapping story. Edna wants an ending in which \"their protagonist\" realises that Harry will never run away with her, and finds a way to successfully reverse her actions so she never gets found out. Salty declares the only realistic way out is if the fan kills Harry, and it will make for great drama in the story.\n\nCaroline returns home early, and Edna chloroforms Harry yet again to conceal him in her wardrobe. Caroline tells Edna that she's aware of the impact of Harry's disappearance, and tries to comfort Edna by letting her know that police have found security footage of someone putting a heavy suitcase into an unmarked van outside the venue on the night of the concert. Edna implores Caroline to let her go to sleep; Caroline laments that she always hopes Edna will come to her with her problems (\"Brave Thing\").\n\nBrianna goes to meet Jules at a vigil, but Jules is nowhere to be found. At the vigil, fans share their grief, which quickly turns to rage when they see how their feelings are being mocked by the media and society writ large (\"Justice\"). Energised and freshly radicalised with a new understanding of feminism from the vigil, Brianna shows up at Jules' house, demanding to know why she abandoned her, to which Jules explains she met a boy on the bus and they are now boyfriend and girlfriend. Moving past this, Brianna insists that Jules recognise how badly they have treated Edna and that she apologise, because she worried about the fact they haven't seen or heard from Edna in three days.\n\nRealising that she cannot bring herself to kill Harry, Edna decides to surrender herself to the police . Before phoning them, she is struck with the revelation that when she does this, she will be seen for the rest of her life as \"a silly little girl\", and no one will stop to try and understand of the forces and expectations which surround girls and shape their options (\"Silly Little Girl\").\n\nJust as she begins the call Brianna and Jules barge into her room unannounced, where, while Jules tries to apologise for her behaviour, they notice a male voice yelling for help from Edna's wardrobe. Jules opens the wardrobe and discovers Harry. Brianna wants to immediately call the police, but Jules forbids it and begins aggressively flirting with Harry while perching on his bound-to-a-chair lap. She tries to take off his gag, but he bites her as soon as his mouth is free. Jules yells in pain, and when he won't let go, Brianna panics and hits him over the head with Edna's laptop, which knocks him out cold. The girls, in a panic, discuss what to do next. Jules suggests killing him, but Brianna proposes they should just drug him and dump him in \"the woods\", to which Edna offers to drive them in her stolen van. While they spin themselves into a panic, Caroline walks into the room and discovers the missing global pop star in her daughter's bedroom. She tells Edna \"you won't be driving anywhere\u2026 I'll drive\" (\"The Woods\").\n\nJumping forward in time, the global fans reflect on their lives since Harry's disappearance and miraculous reappearance. They bond over their shared disbelief in his story that he was kidnapped by a fourteen year old fan and agree it must be fake because of how implausible it is. They reveal that Harry left the band shortly after he returned to the stage and realise that it was not him that they loved, but the feeling of loving something without apology, and being in a community of people who all loved that much and supported each other (\"Nobody (Reprise)\").\n\nEdna, Jules and Brianna reflect on how much has changed since the day they met, much they have been through, and how happy they are that they've come through it and they are all stronger friends and more confident in themselves for it. Brianna is still concerned that one day the police will track them down (\"Maybe We're More\").",

She wants to participate in a music program that could give her a $10,000 scholarship. Her overprotective father Simon, a second-generation restaurateur, disapproves of Terri's plans, wanting her to run the family business.\n\nTerri is very close to her elder brother Paul, who supports her dream. At Paul's graduation-day barbecue, he has a fight with Simon and is grounded. That night, Terri sneaks Paul out of the house to attend a Three Days Grace concert. On their way home, they are hit by a drunk driver, killing Paul.\n\nTerri blames herself for Paul's death and decides to quit singing, but her mother Frances says that Paul's death is not her fault, and that Paul would have wanted Terri to attend the program. She eventually convinces Terri to go, telling Simon that Terri plans to stay with her aunt Nina in Palm Desert, California for the summer while she actually goes to Los Angeles .\n\nTerri arrives in Los Angeles and has a few difficulties: her jacket is stolen, her cab driver is crabby, and initially can't get into the music school. While in the program, Terri makes new friends, including fun-loving DJ Kiwi, quiet pianist Sloane, and talented violinist Denise. Terri learns a great deal about music but has flashbacks of the car crash.\n\nTerri also develops a mutual fondness for British songwriter Jay, but she faces competition from Robyn Childers, who was with Jay the previous summer. Robyn still harbors feelings for Jay, but he does not reciprocate. Jay tries to get Robyn to leave him and Terri alone. On one occasion, Robyn kisses Jay just as Terri walks in. Jay pushes Robyn away, but Terri runs off in tears, ignoring Jay's insistence that the kiss meant nothing. Later, finding him drunk, Terri and Denise take Jay to the roof to sober up. When he does, Jay apologizes, and Terri agrees to finish the song they have been working on for the scholarship contest.\n\nIn the meantime, Simon learns of Terri's ruse, and drives to Los Angeles to bring her home. On the final day, Simon comes to the school and chastises Terri for deceiving him, as well as accuses her of turning his sister and wife against him, but Terri begs her father not to make same mistake he did with Paul and make her run, and not ruin the summer. Ultimately, realizing how selfish he had been, Simon changes his mind.\n\nTerri and Jay perform the song they wrote (\" Someone's Watching Over Me \"), dedicating it to Paul. Even though Denise wins the scholarship prize, Simon is proud of his daughter and her talents, and is also glad that her last memory of Paul is one worth having (the concert), as opposed to Simon's own (their argument). Terri's teachers hope to see her next year; Simon replies that they just might. The students perform together.",

The plot follows a stage troupe of anthropomorphic animals in a perverse comic satire. In contrast to the positive innocence and na\u00efve folly of The Muppets , the Feebles largely present negativity, vice, and other misanthropic characteristics.\n\nThe film is the first Jackson co-wrote with his future partner Fran Walsh , with the two collaborating on all his subsequent films. The film also marked the beginning of Jackson's collaborations with Richard Taylor and W\u0113t\u0101 Workshop , as created by Taylor and Tania Rodger, who all worked on Jackson's subsequent films.",
        "synopsis": "The Feebles Variety Hour theatre troupe is rehearsing with hopes of finding success through being chosen for a syndicated television series. Star performer Heidi the hippopotamus is insulted by pornographic rat director Trevor and complains to her boss and lover Bletch, a sleazy walrus , unaware that he's having an affair with a Siamese cat named Samantha.\n\nRobert, a hedgehog and the troupe's newest member, arrives and immediately falls in love with a poodle named Lucille. He successfully serenades her with encouragement from Arthur, the show's worm manager.\n\nDuring the leadup to the show, different members of the troupe experience their own personal troubles. Sid, an elephant and animal trainer, is visited by his ex-fling Sandy, a chicken , who is filing a paternity suit against him after birthing an elephant-chicken hybrid named Seymour. After a confrontation with Samantha in which she bitterly reveals Bletch's infidelity with her, Heidi tearfully gorges on cake while flipping through her scrapbook of her fame and youth and reminisces on her first meeting with Bletch.\n\nHarry the rabbit is told by his duck doctor, Dr. Quack, that he caught a terminal disease after a threeway, which tabloid reporter F.W. Fly overhears and publishes in the newspaper. Wynyard, a drug-addicted frog who suffers from intense PTSD from his experiences in the Vietnam War , is desperately looking for money in order to obtain more drugs. Trevor drugs and rapes Lucille in order to entice her into being his new actress for his pornos, causing Robert to think that she's being unfaithful and dump her. Bletch, while playing golf with his henchman Barry the bulldog , initiates a confidential drug deal with a Scottish-accented warthog named Cedric and his Australian-accented Wolfhound henchman, Louie.\n\nAfter a disastrous rehearsal, Heidi is berated by Sebastian, the show's gay Arctic fox director, for overeating after a piece of Black Forest gateau in her cleavage, causing her to run into Bletch's office to vent to him again - only to catch him receiving oral sex from Samantha, upsetting her twice as much and resulting in her trashing her dressing room.\n\nBletch, realising that Cedric provided him borax , decides that he, along with Trevor and Barry, go to the docks and obtain the drugs themselves after using the borax to kill a perverted, panty-sniffing Aardvark named Dennis and then Louie. But before they leave, Bletch is informed by Sebastian that the show is off as Heidi is refusing to perform, but he successfully persuades her by feigning lust for her and they briefly have sex.\n\nAt the docks, Bletch, Trevor and Barry obtain the drugs after killing Cedric, his whale boss Mr. Big, and several crab henchmen, but Barry is decapitated by a giant black widow spider in their ensuing escape. On their way back to the theater, Bletch learns of Harry's disease in the newspaper and kills F.W. for gossiping about it. During the show, Sebastian tells Bletch that they were chosen for a syndicated series by the network.\n\nAs Bletch celebrates in his office, Heidi attempts to seduce him, only for him to harshly reject her, insult her and tell her that he intends to replace her with Samantha as the star. Humiliated and heartbroken and after experiencing hallucinations of the troupe laughing at her, Heidi decides to commit suicide; after failing to hang herself, she prepares to kill herself using an M60 machine gun in Bletch's office. But before she can do so, Samantha enters to retrieve her purse, spots Heidi  and taunts her again, causing Heidi to snap and shoot Samantha dead in response.\n\nMeanwhile, the show gradually goes awry: an ailing Harry vomits all over the stage, Sid is accosted by Sandy in front of the audience, an intoxicated Wynyard accidentally kills himself during his knife-throwing act and Sebastian performs a musical number about sodomy in a desperate attempt to save the show.\n\nHeidi goes on a violent rampage throughout the theater, killing many troupe members, including Harry, just after Dr. Quack informed him that his illness wasn't terminal after all, and Sandy, before shooting Sid in his kneecaps. Before she can kill Lucille, Robert swoops to her rescue, saying that he still loves her, with Lucille revealing what Trevor did to her earlier. Before Heidi can kill Bletch, he tries to calm her down by claiming that he still loves her, but this proves to be a ruse to make Heidi lower her guard so Trevor can kill her. Suddenly, Robert attacks Trevor, allowing Heidi to retrieve her gun and kill both Trevor and then Bletch. Arthur regretfully informs Heidi that he has just reported her to the authorities and Heidi, accepting her fate, requests that he plays her song one last time before she is arrested.\n\nA photographic postscript reveals what happened to the survivors following the massacre: Sid became a struggling horticulturalist with Seymour following his kneecap surgeries, Arthur received an OBE and retired to the countryside, Sebastian wrote an autobiography about the incident and is negotiating the film rights, Robert and Lucille got married and had two children and Heidi, after serving ten years in a female penitentiary , was rehabilitated into the community and now works at a large supermarket under a new identity.",

Albert McKinley (David Sabin), the principal, defends him.\n\nSarah Larkin (Sally Niven), music teacher and church choir leader, is another of Albert's foundlings. Mike and Sarah meet and are attracted to each other. Mike tries to change her personality to suit his desires, and Sarah disapproves, but they enjoy their time together.\n\nFor a while Mike and Sarah enjoy their teatimes and hayrides left alone. But Sarah has an enemy, her own sister, Eugenie Seldin (Judy Frank), a lively and outspoken waitress at the local truck-stop eatery. Eugenie spots Mike right away and sets her sights. After all, hadn't she known Sarah's late husband in ways Sarah never did?\n\nAnd soon enough, Mike develops an enemy of his own. The brightest kid in class, Tommy (Steve Skiles) is the son of the athletic coach, Herbert Heller (Art Wallace), who doesn't like English teachers to begin with because their drama classes mess up his gym floor. When he finds out that Mike is encouraging young Tommy to read Thoreau and think for himself, well, he can spot a Commie pretty far off.\n\nAnd Herbert Heller is a real \"Americun\". Only once a year he's apt to get drunk and shoot up the place. This year, as Mike and Sarah stand listening to Christmas carolers and enjoy being together, he comes upon them, carrying a shotgun in one hand, and Old Glory in the other. When he demands that Mike pledge allegiance to the flag, then and there, it gets kind of tight. Luckily, Herbert is too drunk to be effective and falls down. Mike carries Sarah off over his shoulder and Herbert is taken away for another year.\n\nBy now, Sarah is enchanted with Mike, thought resisting him (\"I'm not going to be a challenge to you and have you have the satisfaction of seeing me develop!\") But develop she does. And by now young Tom Heller is actively practicing civil disobedience, though in a kind of tentative way. With some effort he manages to get himself jailed for the night, though Mike explains that this isn't strictly necessary. Tommy's girlfriend, Ramona (Anne Kaye), is trying to keep up with him. But Tommy can't see it. Was there a Mrs. Davy Crockett? A Mrs. Jim Bowie? Please. He'd rather do it all alone.\n\nThe kindly townspeople, good-hearted as they come, overlook Herbert's shotgun shenanigans and nominate him for Man of the Century in the coming Centennial Celebration. Tommy just can't see his old man as \"having influenced the entire population of Bloomdale\" (Of course he doesn't know him the way other people do.) So Tommy nominates Mike Butler. Herbert finds this upsetting (\"I'll tan your hide, boy.) and calls Mike a pantywaist.\n\nThere is to be a mock wedding at the Centennial, Sarah as mock-bride, Albert McKinney as mock-groom. But Albert comes to Sarah and proposes. He offers a real wedding, in Civil War costume, horse-drawn vehicles , a shivaree , and then a simple life thereafter. (It's just that the Centennial seemed the perfect time--and it only comes every 100 years.\") Sarah demurs. She's in love with Mike.\n\nTommy has a real campaign going to elect Mike the Man of the Century. If Mike were elected, maybe he could even get rid of that smell from the canning factory . Tommy's father reacts by nudging Tommy toward enlistment in the Army. He wants his boy to be an athlete, a hero or, at the very least, a star on the memorial monument.\n\nSarah tells Albert she's in love with Mike, and Albert takes steps. He goes to her sister to ask a favor. Eugenie must tell Sarah that Mike was in prison and, worse, to say that Mike told her all about it when they were together \"listening to records.\" This happens as planned, and has the expected effect. Sarah is appalled. (\"A criminal is a criminal is a criminal.\") Mike says he was in the Army during Vietnam, but he couldn't kill anyone. For this, he spent five years in the penitentiary. His mistake had been not being a conscientious objector in the first place. Albert and Sarah become engaged.\n\nThe Centennial Celebration turns into a kind of trial. Eugenie, beautifully drunk, appears and shouts out the secret of Mike's past. When he speaks to defend himself, Mike finds himself in a kind of kangaroo court , surrounded by his peers. \"Fire Him!\" shouts Herbert, and McKinley does. But it also becomes apparent to Sarah that Albert knew about Mike all along. And at last she sees through his sanctimonious disguise.\n\nTommy says goodbye to Mike Butler. Tommy and Ramona are together now, and it is very clear that they, at least, are going to be all right. But what about Butler? He'll go to some other town, some town probably a good deal like this one. Tommy says maybe he'll be a teacher too. They embrace.\n\nNow you just can't do a thing like that. Herbert Heller sees his boy Tommy embraced by this \"Commie queer\" and he gets his shotgun and fires it right at him. But of course Helbert is the \"true example of American manhood\" and gets elected Man of the Century anyway. So it's all right. Even if he isn't much of a shot anymore. A man can't do everything well. All he can do is try. And \"Now Is The Time For All Good Men\" to do just that.

        "title": "Smoke on the Mountain",
        "description": "Smoke on the Mountain is an Off-Broadway musical with a book by Connie Ray and conceived of and directed by Alan Bailey. It was originally workshopped at the McCarter Theatre in 1988, given a full staging at the McCarter in 1990, and was subsequently moved by the McCarter to Lamb's Theatre in New York City , New York in 1990 and had 475 performances. The Lamb's revived it in 1998. The name of the musical comes from Psalm 104 :32: \"He who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke\". Smoke on the Mountain is one of the most produced shows worldwide. [ citation needed ]",
        "synopsis": "Most of the songs in Smoke on the Mountain are old hymns , with some original and anachronistic bluegrass songs mixed in. The cast plays their own instruments. (Some productions have non-speaking players arrive as additional 'family members'.) Each character has a monologue and a featured song. It is performed in two acts.\n\nThe setting is in a Mount Pleasant , North Carolina Baptist church in 1938 and it revolves around the Sanders family. The Sanders Family is delayed from performing at the musical revival. Reverend Oglethorpe is forced to get the service going by playing \" Rock of Ages \" for those in attendance. Rev. Oglethorpe stalls for time by giving announcements. The Sanders Family enters with great gusto, after revealing their automobile tipped over into a ditch after the whole family leaned to one side of the car to look at all the pickles floating downstream from the Mount Pleasant Pickle Factory. They start the service by singing \" The Church in the Wildwood \" and introduce themselves to the congregation (\"A Wonderful Time Up There\"). Burl is the patriarch, Stanley is Burl's brother, Vera is the family matriarch, Denise and Denis are fraternal twins, and June does interpretive signs. The first act ends as June and Denise begin to \"dance\" (a simple foot kick and hip slap of a tambourine). This upsets the pious Miss Maude and Miss Myrtle (who are the only two known to be in attendance). The dance prompts a stern talking to from the reverend to the girls because the church \"doesn't dance.\" Upset, Stanley leaves in a huff. Burl and Denis leave to go find him, leaving Vera finishing the song through tears of embarrassment.\n\nWhen the family returns, the service continues. During \"Whispering Hope\" it is implied that June is flirting with the reverend. The family is excited to perform one of their signature \"medleys\". The family ends the night by quoting the titular bible verse/song, Psalm 104:32: \"He who looks at the earth, and it trembles, who touches the mountains, and they smoke.\"",

        "title": "Early to Bed (musical)",
        "description": "Early to Bed is a musical produced by Richard Kollmar with music by Fats Waller , and lyrics and book by George Marion Jr. The comic farce takes place in a brothel in Martinique , which various visitors arriving for an international athletics competition mistake for a finishing school . The madam attempts to maintain this misapprehension while various characters have romantic dalliances.\n\nIt premiered in Boston , Massachusetts, in 1943 before moving to Broadway for a year-long run, and it subsequently went on tour. Much of the original material for Early to Bed was lost after the tour, including four of its songs, and no cast recordings exist due to the 1942\u20131944 musicians' strike . Some of its songs were published as sheet music, and Waller recorded versions of some of them himself, but he died suddenly during the Broadway run. Two of its songs feature in the 1978 revue Ain't Misbehavin' , and the show was reconstructed and performed as a small-scale revival in 2009.\n\nEarly to Bed received highly positive reviews, with critics praising the performances and visual elements. Waller's music received a more mixed reception, and the plot, though one-dimensional, was considered enjoyable.\n\nDespite its success, Early to Bed came at a time when Broadway musicals were becoming more ambitious in scope, and its variety show aesthetic quickly became dated, limiting historical interest and the appetite for revivals. Today it is best known for featuring the music of Waller, and it marks the first instance of a black composer writing a Broadway show for a mostly white cast.",
        "synopsis": "Each of the two acts of Early to Bed is framed as a flashback being narrated by a character named O'Connor in a present-day New York bar. The action takes place in interwar Martinique . El Magnifico, an ageing Spanish bullfighter, is travelling to the \"Pan-American Goodwill Games\" with his son, Pablo, and his valet, Pooch, when his car breaks down. The son is hit by another car and is taken to recover at the Angry Pigeon, a bordello run by Rowena, a former schoolteacher. The woman who was driving, a nightclub dancer named Lois who was travelling to a gig, is also injured, and is taken to the Angry Pigeon as well. The pair fall in love. El Magnifico and Rowena have had a romantic affair in the past, and still feel a connection, and Pooch and Rowena's maid Lily-Ann are also attracted to each other.\n\nAt the Angry Pigeon is a newly-hired prostitute named Eileen\u00a0\u2013 of all the newcomers, she is the only one who understands that the Angry Pigeon is a brothel, with all the others assuming it is a finishing school . Rowena keeps the true nature of the establishment hidden in order to continue wooing El Magnifico. Presently, the California State University track team arrive in the area for the Goodwill Games, and El Magnifico invites them to stay at the Angry Pigeon. Together with the prostitutes they build a parade float for the Games, but the effort expended on building it, and interacting with the prostitutes, leads to the team losing. President Roosevelt congratulates them via radio regardless, assuming that they deliberately allowed the other countries to win, and the Martinique mayor acknowledges Rowena and the Angry Pigeon for their role. All the couples are united.",

In the story, when an overworked mother and her teenage daughter magically swap bodies, they have just one day to put things right again before the mom's wedding.\n\nA film adaptation was released on Disney Channel in 2018.",
        "synopsis": "The musical opens with Ellie Blake telling the audience about the worst 24 hours of her life (\"Just One Day\"). Her mother, Katherine, is a wedding planner who is getting married the next day while simultaneously arranging her own wedding. Ellie is resentful towards her brother, Fletcher, for annoying her; and her soon to be stepfather, Mike, for being overbearing. Ellie's friends, Gretchen and Hannah, want her to join them in The Hunt, a scavenger hunt that involves traveling around the city all night. Katherine forbids it because The Hunt is the same time as the rehearsal dinner. This leads to a confrontation between Ellie and Katherine that ends with a magical hourglass being broken and the two switching bodies (\"The Hourglass\").\n\nThey try to switch back but the magic only works when the hourglass is whole. Ellie suggests using the hourglass's twin as a replacement. Katherine reveals that she sold the hourglass's twin, a present from her late husband, to help pay for her catering business. The two decide that they have to pretend to be one another until the second magical hourglass can be found. Both think that the other's life is easier and each one is confident she will do a better job (\"I Got This\"). Ellie has to be interviewed by Danielle for Weddings Magazine about her upcoming ceremony. She relies on Katherine's assistant, Torrey, to answer most of the questions and fabricates a story of how she operates her business (\"What You Got\"). She starts an impromptu party in the kitchen that destroys the wedding cake. Katherine attends Ellie's school and realizes how difficult Ellie's school life is with harsh teachers and a bully named Savannah. Katherine meets Adam and her teenage body's chemistry makes her feel attracted to him (\"Oh, Biology\"). Mike arrives at the house to get ready for the rehearsal dinner and is interviewed with Ellie about their beautiful flowers. Ellie does not know anything about him and the interview goes terribly. Mike decides to read his vows to \"Katherine\" and she is repulsed by him, confusing everybody present (\"Vows\").\n\nEllie and Katherine discover secrets about each other. Ellie discovers her mother smokes cigarettes and Katherine discovers her daughter has a lower back tattoo. Ellie's friends and their parents also discover each other's secrets leading to mutual distrust (\"Busted\"). Ellie and Katherine also discover that each has kept a memento signifying their former close relationship. A parent/teacher conference is called to discuss Ellie's many absences and outlandish behavior. During the conference, Mrs. Luckenbill reveals that Ellie's behavior got worse after her father died. Ellie shrugs this off while Katherine realizes how busy she has been lately, taking no time for her daughter and marrying a man before giving her daughter time to grieve (\"Somebody Has Got to Take the Blame\"). Before they can discuss this further, Katherine is taken to gym class by Ms. Meyers.\n\nAfter Ellie picks up Fletcher from his school, she discovers that the pawn shop her mom sold the hourglass to has closed. Fletcher inspires her to put the hourglass on the list for The Hunt. This way every student at Ellie's school will be looking for it and once it is found, they can switch back. Ellie texts Katherine to ask Adam, who is in charge of The Hunt, to make the hourglass one of the scavenger hunt's items. Katherine tries to ally herself with Savannah, who is a champion of The Hunt, in hopes of getting to the item first. Gretchen and Hannah feel betrayed by \"Ellie\" and Adam refuses to add the hourglass as it wouldn't be fair to the other competitors. All the while, Ms. Meyers is giving Katherine a strenuous P.E. exam and Katherine ultimately fails (\"Watch Your Back\").\n\nFletcher tells his \"mom\" how excited he is to have a new dad. The cynical Ellie reveals how many times his parents have lied to him about things in his childhood while also lamenting how her father promised he would never leave her, only to die (\"Parents Lie\"). All of the guests arrive for the dinner rehearsal while Ellie and Katherine's lives begin to fall apart. Gretchen and Hannah kick \"Ellie\" off of the team for working with Savannah. Torrey quits because of the immense pressure about the Weddings Magazine article and trying to replace the destroyed wedding cake. \"Katherine\" tells Mike that she may call off the wedding. Fletcher is furious at his family and he decides to run away from home. The wedding guests discover Fletcher has run away and wonder what tomorrow will bring (\"Just One Day (Reprise)\").\n\nAll of the wedding guests band together to find Fletcher while Ellie, Katherine, and Torrey lament to the audience how wrong this day has gone (\"Not Myself Today\"). Fletcher sits at the bus stop waiting to take him to Las Vegas. Adam comes across Fletcher and tells him how he was angry with his family when he was younger but reconciled with them because they ultimately love each other. Adam and Fletcher bond over how crazy their families can be (\"Women and Sandwiches\").\n\nMike calls the police to look for Fletcher. The officers do not listen to Katherine thinking she is just a teenager. They inundate Ellie with questions who realizes that she doesn't know her brother that well. The officers jump to the worst possible conclusions, worrying the entire family (\"Bring My Baby (Brother) Home\"). Adam arrives with Fletcher after having convinced him to come home. \"Katherine\" tells Adam that the hourglass was a gift from Ellie's late father and he decides to put it on the list, seeing how important it is to her. Gretchen and Hannah ask \"Ellie\" to come back to the team and forgiveness for their hastiness. Ellie gives Katherine permission to go on The Hunt while she stays behind to fix the wedding.\n\nAdam announces the items for The Hunt over the phone and all of the students run around the city looking for them (\"Go\"). Ellie tries to convince Danielle to stay, promising that nothing will go wrong at the wedding. Ellie convinces Torrey to return to work and Mike replaces the wedding cake with seven-layer bars. Danielle is invited to help out and she decides to give them one more chance. They stay up all night ensuring that the wedding will be perfect for tomorrow morning. Fletcher is tired out and Ellie sings him to sleep and emotionally connects with him for this first time in years (\"After All of This and Everything\").\n\nSavannah's team and Ellie's team become tied for the lead with the only item remaining being the hourglass. They find the hourglass at Mrs. Time's Watch Shop and are able to retrieve it. Savannah arrives and blackmails Mrs. Time into giving her the hourglass. This leads to a physical altercation over the hourglass with Katherine breaking Savannah's nose and stealing it back (\"No More Fear\"). Katherine arrives at the house before the wedding ceremony commences. Katherine and Ellie try to switch places, only for the hourglass not to work (\"The Other Hourglass\"). Both of them worry about living in the other's body for the rest of their lives. Katherine tells Ellie to call off the wedding with Mike until they can fix this. Ellie delivers an impassioned speech about how difficult her family's lives have been since her father's death. It wasn't until Mike came into their lives that Katherine became happy once again. Once Ellie says \"I love you\", the hourglass begins to glow. Katherine and Ellie grab hold of the hourglass and affirm their love for each other, switching back to their original bodies. Ellie and Katherine realize how difficult each other's lives are and decide never to take the other for granted. Katherine marries Mike and the wedding party celebrates (\"Today and Ev'ry Day\").",

        "title": "The Nightmare Before Christmas",
        "description": "The Nightmare Before Christmas (also known as Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas ) is a 1993 American stop-motion Gothic fantasy film directed by Henry Selick and written by Caroline Thompson . It tells the tale of Jack Skellington , King of Halloween Town, who stumbles upon Christmas Town and becomes obsessed with celebrating the holiday himself. Danny Elfman wrote the songs and score and provided the singing voice of Jack. The principal voice cast includes Chris Sarandon , Catherine O'Hara , William Hickey , Ken Page , Paul Reubens , Glenn Shadix and Ed Ivory.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas originated from a poem written by Tim Burton in 1982 while he was working as an animator at Walt Disney Productions . With the critical success of Vincent that same year, Burton began to consider developing the story as either a short film or a half-hour television special , to no avail. Over the years, Burton's thoughts regularly returned to the project, and in 1990 he made a development deal with the Walt Disney Studios . Production, under Burton and Denise Di Novi , started in July 1991. Disney initially released the film through the Touchstone Pictures label because the studio believed the film's Gothic tone would be \"too dark and scary for kids.\"\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 9, 1993, and was given a limited release on October 13, before a wide theatrical release on October 29. The film was met with critical and commercial success upon release, and has since garnered a cult following . It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects , a first for an animated film. Thirteen years after its initial release, the film was reissued by Walt Disney Pictures and was re-released annually from 2006 until 2010.\n\nIn 2023, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant.\"",
        "synopsis": "Halloween Town is a fantasy world populated by various monsters and supernatural beings associated with the eponymous holiday. Jack Skellington , the well-respected Pumpkin King, leads the town in organizing its annual celebrations. This year however, Jack is weary of the same routine and longs for something new. Upon discovering trees containing doors to other holiday-themed worlds, Jack stumbles through the one leading to Christmas Town and is fascinated by the unfamiliar holiday.\n\nJack returns home and shares his discovery with his friends and neighbors, but they struggle to grasp the concept of Christmas, although they relate to its ruler, Santa Claus , or \"Sandy Claws\" as Jack mistakenly dubs him. After several futile attempts at finding a way to rationally explain Christmas, Jack decides to \"improve\" the holiday instead. He announces that Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year and assigns Christmas-themed jobs, such as singing carols, making presents and building a sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer , to various residents.\n\nSally, the feminine creation of local mad scientist Doctor Finkelstein, experiences a vision predicting that their efforts will end disastrously. Jack, whom she secretly loves, dismisses her warnings and instructs her to make a Santa Claus suit for him. He tasks mischievous trick-or-treating trio Lock, Shock and Barrel with abducting Santa; however, he orders them not to involve their superior Oogie Boogie, a bogeyman with a passion for gambling and Jack's long-time rival, in their plot.\n\nWhen Lock, Shock and Barrel bring Santa to Halloween Town, Jack tells him that he will take care of Christmas this year and orders the trio to keep Santa safe. However, they disobey Jack's orders and bring Santa to Oogie, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. As Jack departs to deliver presents in the real world, Sally, after failing to stop him beforehand, attempts to rescue Santa from Oogie, only to be captured herself.\n\nJack's Halloween-themed presents terrify the real world's populace, who contact the local authorities and are instructed to lock down their homes for protection. The military is alerted and Jack is shot out of the sky, leading Halloween Town's populace to believe he is dead. It is revealed that he survived and has crashed into a nearby cemetery . Bemoaning the trouble that he has caused, Jack realizes he nonetheless enjoyed the experience and that it gave him new ideas for celebrating next Halloween, reigniting his love for the holiday.\n\nUpon returning home, Jack rescues Santa and Sally, confronts Oogie and defeats him by unraveling a thread holding his cloth form together, causing all of the insects inside Oogie to spill out and reduce him to nothing. Though displeased with Jack for his foolish actions and not listening to Sally earlier, Santa makes amends with him and resumes his yearly duties, replacing Jack's presents with genuine ones and saving Christmas.\n\nAll of Halloween Town celebrates Jack's return. Santa brings a snowfall to the town, thereby bringing the Christmas spirit upon it, while Jack and Sally finally declare their love for each other.",

        "synopsis": "### Act one\n\nThe members of UCLA 's sorority Delta Nu congratulate their president, Elle Woods ; Elle is expecting her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III, to propose marriage to her later that night. Led by Margot, Serena, and Pilar, the girls help Elle find the perfect dress for the occasion (\"Omigod You Guys\"). However, when Elle goes on her dinner date with Warner, he tells her that he needs to date someone more \"serious\" to boost his reputation and achieve his dream of becoming a Senator , and breaks up with her (\"Serious\").\n\nElle is devastated and stays in her room for twelve days (\"Daughter of Delta Nu\"), but decides to follow Warner to Harvard Law School to prove that she can be serious. With help from her Delta Nu sister Kate, Elle studies for the LSAT . Instead of writing a personal essay, Elle bursts into the Harvard admission offices backed up by a squad of cheerleaders and frat boys. She is accepted after revealing she is motivated by love (\"What You Want\").\n\nAt Harvard, Elle's highly-achieved classmates disapprove of her attire and personality, and the only person who is willing to help her is teaching assistant Emmett Forrest (\"The Harvard Variations\"). Following a suggestion from Elle's classmate, Vivienne Kensington, the conniving Professor Callahan kicks Elle out of his class because she did not read the case he assigned, and Emmett is unable to help her (\"Blood in the Water\"). Afterwards, Elle finds out that Vivienne is Warner's new girlfriend. This \"tragedy\" summons the apparitions of the sisters of Delta Nu who, acting as a Greek chorus visible and audible only to Elle, encourage her to stay positive (\"Positive\").\n\nElle, believing that being blonde is the problem, decides to become a brunette. At the nearby Hair Affair salon, Elle meets beautician and Hair Affair owner, Paulette Buonufonte. Paulette tells Elle that all bad hair decisions are motivated by love and reveals her dreams of meeting a handsome Irishman. Paulette encourages Elle not to give up or downplay her personal qualities (\"Ireland\"). At the salon, Vivienne, who is discussing a party planned for next Friday, unexpectedly gives Elle an invitation, telling her it is a costume party. Paulette gives Elle a costume for the party and more words of encouragement (\"Ireland (Reprise)\").\n\nWalking into the party dressed as a Playboy Bunny , Elle soon realizes that she was tricked by Vivienne, as no one else is wearing a costume. Despite this, she still seeks out Warner in an effort to win him back, but he remains unimpressed, only caring about her looks (\"Serious (Reprise)\"). Elle runs from the party, only to meet Emmett, who struggles to understand Elle's romantic problems. Emmett helps Elle assess her priorities, and she realizes her obsession with Warner is preventing her from gaining his respect. Freed from her need to please Warner, she defeats him in a classroom debate (\"Chip On My Shoulder\"). Elle helps Paulette get custody of her dog back from her ex-boyfriend, using legal jargon and demonstrating that she is beginning to understand law (\"Run Rufus Run / Elle Reflects\").\n\nWarner, Vivienne, and Enid win three of Callahan's four coveted internship positions. Warner proposes to Vivienne on the spot in front of Elle, and Vivienne accepts. Elle is devastated, but Emmett shows her the internship list, revealing Elle got an internship position as well. Elle realizes that she does not need a man to feel accepted in the world, and that all she needs is to believe in herself. Overjoyed, she celebrates, and eagerly anticipates the trial (\"So Much Better\").\n\n### Act two\n\nCallahan, Elle, Emmett, Vivienne, Warner, and Enid watch a workout video made by fitness queen Brooke Wyndham and her fitness team, while Callahan tells the legal team that Brooke is accused of murdering her billionaire husband (\"Whipped Into Shape\"). At the jail, the legal team is unable to get Brooke to tell them her alibi and she refuses to plead guilty. Upon learning that they were both Delta Nu members (\"Delta Nu Nu Nu\"), Brooke then privately tells Elle her alibi; Brooke was getting liposuction , and she believes revealing the truth could ruin her reputation as a fitness guru. Brooke makes Elle promise not to tell anyone. Because of Elle's loyalty to her client and refusal to state the alibi, both Elle and, consequently, Emmett, are shunned by the group. To cheer Emmett up and to increase his chances of impressing Callahan, Elle gives him a makeover (\"Take It Like a Man\").\n\nBack at the salon, Elle is getting a manicure when Kyle, a sexy UPS courier, walks into the salon to deliver a package to Paulette. Paulette is in awe of Kyle, but her low self-confidence prevents her from making a move. When he leaves, Pilar, Serena, and Margot are summoned by Paulette's amazing \"Bend and Snap\" when picking up the package. The sorority girls tell Paulette to use the \"Bend and Snap\" dance move on Kyle to turn him on, but when she does, she accidentally breaks his nose (\"Bend and Snap\").\n\nAt the trial, Brooke's pool boy Nikos claims to have been having an affair with Brooke, giving her a motive for murdering her husband. After doing the \"Bend and Snap\" in front of Nikos and getting no response, Elle suspects that Nikos is gay. With the exception of Brooke, Elle's teammates and Callahan are not convinced and debate whether his perceived flamboyance is because he is homosexual or because he is European. Emmett successfully makes Nikos slip and state that his boyfriend's name is Carlos, although Nikos claims that he misunderstood \"boyfriend\" for \"best friend\". Carlos, fed up with the closeted nature of his gay boyfriend, appears from the gallery and proclaims Nikos's homosexuality. Nikos confesses that he is indeed gay and European (\"There! Right There!\").\n\nLater that night in Callahan's office, the interns celebrate Elle's skill. Callahan dismisses Emmett and the other interns but requests Elle to remain for a few moments. After telling Elle she has instincts, Callahan forcibly kisses her, leading her to slap him. Warner and Vivienne both see the kiss through the door, but only Vivienne sees the slap. Elle asks Callahan if he only gave her the internship because he wanted to seduce her. Callahan fires Elle. After Callahan leaves, Warner re-enters the office and mocks Elle for allegedly sleeping with Callahan, but Vivienne tells him to shut up and they both leave. Elle becomes distraught and prepares to go home, and tells Emmett what Callahan did. Emmett asks her to stay, but before he can admit his love for her she leaves (\"Legally Blonde\").\n\nElle heads to the Hair Affair to say goodbye to Paulette, but before she can leave, Vivienne and Enid convince Elle otherwise. Elle discards her lawyerly navy suit, dons a pink dress and leads a parade back to the courtroom. Elle's parents, as well as Delta Nu, arrive, having come to visit her. They all meet Kyle on the way, who has taken a liking to Paulette, and reveals himself to be Irish, prompting everyone present to Irish dance . Back at the trial, Brooke fires Callahan and hires Elle (\"Legally Blonde Remix\"). Brooke's stepdaughter Chutney goes to the witness stand and her testimony is damning, stating after she got out of the shower she saw Brooke covered in her father's blood. After Chutney states she received a perm the day of the murder, Elle realizes a flaw in Chutney's alibi and suggests that the entire court should be moved to the scene of the crime\u2014the bathroom where the murder took place (\"Scene of the Crime\").\n\nAs a demonstration, Elle asks Paulette to give Enid a perm and asks Enid to step into the shower upon entering the crime scene. Relying on her knowledge of hair maintenance, Elle's demonstration is successful as Enid walks out of the shower with completely flattened hair, revealing that Chutney could not have possibly showered immediately after getting a perm because her perm was still intact. Under Elle's intense questioning, Chutney confesses that she killed her father, thinking that she was killing Brooke. Chutney is arrested and Brooke is set free. Brooke accidentally admits she had liposuction, but doesn't lose any fans (\"Omigod You Guys (Reprise)\").\n\nWarner proposes to Elle, having been dumped by Vivienne. Elle gently refuses, claiming to have been changed by the experience. Three years later, Elle ends up as the valedictorian of her class. Paulette tells the audience that Elle is not one to brag about her valedictorian status, so she decided to allow Paulette to play \"Where Are They Now\" during her speech. Paulette says that Enid practices family law, Vivienne is training for the Peace Corps , and Warner dropped out to pursue a modeling career. Callahan ran for governor but was defeated, and his wife hired Emmett to handle their divorce. Paulette married Kyle, had two kids and is pregnant with a third. They live in Worcester, Massachusetts (Later replaced with their third child being named Seamus), and Paulette bought a new salon (\"Find My Way\"). At the end of the graduation, Elle proposes to Emmett, who happily accepts (\"Finale\").",

        "title": "Napoleon (musical)",
        "description": "Napoleon is a musical by Timothy Williams and Andrew Sabiston . It has had seven productions in four languages: English, French, Korean and Dutch.",
        "synopsis": "The musical is a behind-the-scenes account of the Corsican man who rose from nothing to become Emperor of France. It is told through the eyes of an unreliable narrator , Talleyrand , a Machiavellian career politician who latches onto the young Napoleon and places him on the throne of an empire vaster than Rome . The narrative is Talleyrand's version of events, coloured and skewed by his own opinions as he steps in and out of scenes, offering comments and manipulating the plot. He spins facts to his purpose, has things he wants the audience to know, and others he struggles to keep hidden. Talleyrand thinks he can manage the extraordinary man he\u2019s groomed for greatness. What he isn\u2019t prepared for is the sheer force of Napoleon\u2019s character - and his obsession with Josephine . In the battle to come, Napoleon and Josephine will play out one of the world\u2019s most iconic love stories, while Talleyrand will emerge as the devil incarnate.\n\n### Act I\n\nThe curtain rises on a nightmare vision of the Battle of Waterloo . Napoleon\u2019s inability to command shocks his marshals who beg him to give the order to advance but can only watch helplessly as their troops are slaughtered (\u201cWaterloo Opening\u201d). This vision is revealed to be a memory of Talleyrand, first seen as a troubled old man grappling with the question of how Napoleon went from a blazing comet of passion and virtue to the ghost of a once-great man (\u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong with Him?\u201d). The guilt Talleyrand feels for his role in that transformation consumes him. He takes us back in time to tell his story.\n\nHe introduces us to Napoleon at 24: a firebrand of shining ideals. He has returned to his native Corsica to lead an uprising against the government of Pasquale Paoli (\u201cThrow Him Out\u201d). Napoleon has been attending the \u00c9cole Militaire in Paris, witnessed the Revolution unfolding in France and wants to bring its values of equality and justice to his homeland, but his coup attempt fails, and he and his family are banished to France (\u201cBrothers\u201d). Napoleon\u2019s brother, Lucien, struggles to understand why Napoleon would risk his life for a cause. Napoleon explains that in this cruel world, a vendetta against those who keep the masses oppressed is the only path to change (\u201cWounded\u201d).\n\nNapoleon and Lucien arrive to find Paris in chaos. The king has just been beheaded, law and order are non-existent, and a corrupt government led by the debauched Paul Barras is squandering the Revolution\u2019s promise (\u201cA Place Like Paris\u201d). Witnessing the people\u2019s suffering, Lucien becomes an activist. Napoleon meets Talleyrand, who is miserable in his job as Barras\u2019 senior minister and relentlessly mocked for his physical infirmity \u2013 a withered leg which requires him to use a cane. Talleyrand has no patience for the hot-headed Napoleon, but when General Henri, the head of the army, is impressed by the military genius of Napoleon\u2019s plan to defend Toulon against an attack by the British, Talleyrand sees an opportunity to improve his fortunes and attaches himself to Napoleon, claiming him as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 (\u201cProvidence\u201d).\n\nNapoleon\u2019s brilliant defence of Toulon is a stunning success and Talleyrand introduces him to Parisian society, making him the toast of the town. At a ball hosted by the wealthy Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Tallien, Napoleon meets her friend Rose De Beauharnais and is instantly infatuated (\u201cThe Victims\u2019 Ball\u201d). Rose is Barras\u2019 mistress. Seeing her laughing and dancing with Napoleon, Barras violently orders her to leave and belittles Napoleon in front of the crowd. A penniless widow of the Revolution, Rose has been forced into this sordid liaison by her desperate circumstances. She escapes by imagining the life a fortune teller once predicted for her, that she would one day be greater than a queen (\u201cOne Day\u201d). Th\u00e9r\u00e8se promises she\u2019ll find a man of means for her, but for now advises Rose to bide her time with Barras. Napoleon calls on Rose and tells her that if she were his he\u2019d give her the world, though he thinks her name doesn\u2019t suit her as well as the one he\u2019d give her \u2013 Josephine (\u201cJosephine\u201d). Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, finding her friend with Napoleon again, fears for her safety and encourages her to avoid him. Talleyrand worries that Barras will dismiss Napoleon from the army just as his career is taking off. He counsels his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to forget Rose and uses his two henchmen, FOUCH\u00c9 and Garrau, to foment an uprising that Napoleon will be called upon to quell, making his dismissal impossible (\u201cVend\u00e9miaire\u201d).\n\nLucien and Henri are shocked by the brutal tactics Napoleon  employs to stop the uprising \u2013 using cannons on the protesters \u2013 but Barras is pleased and rewards him with a promotion that will send him away: the command of France\u2019s Alpine border forces. Before Napoleon leaves, he invites Josephine to his humble apartments where they have an impassioned night together and fall in love (\u201cOn This First Night\u201d). The next morning, Napoleon shares his battle plans with her. She marvels at his brilliance, believing he'll triumph. Meanwhile, Henri and the army, already on the march, gripe about Napoleon\u2019s plans, calling them the scribblings of a madman (\u201cThe Road to Austria\u201d). Napoleon proposes marriage and Josephine accepts. Talleyrand is incensed but they marry in haste.\n\nNapoleon\u2019s ambitious march over the Alps dispirits his troops. He intends to take the anti-revolutionary Austrian army by surprise, but his army, exhausted and demoralized, is convinced they\u2019ll be slaughtered. Napoleon wins them over with a rousing appeal that begins as quiet words of encouragement to a terrified young soldier named ANTON the night before the battle (\u201cThe Dream Within\u201d). Against all odds, Napoleon and his army are victorious.\n\nTalleyrand is delighted when Napoleon receives a hero\u2019s welcome from the people on his return to Paris (\u201cThe Day Is Won\u201d). Barras is threatened by Napoleon\u2019s popularity and orders Talleyrand to fix it. Talleyrand encourages Napoleon to stage a coup against Barras. (\u201cThe Journey Begins\u201d). The plotting spreads across Paris. Josephine convinces Th\u00e9r\u00e8se to fund the coup in payment for some unspecified trouble Th\u00e9r\u00e8se caused Josephine while Napoleon was in the Alps (the details of which we will learn later). Lucien prints pamphlets to whip up the masses, Anton helps distribute them, and Henri agrees to give Napoleon the support of the army but cautions him not to abuse his trust. Henri\u2019s daughter, CLARICE, meets and falls in love with Anton in the thrill and danger of the building plot which leads to the storming of the government council chamber (\u201cThe Eighteenth of Brumaire\u201d). Barras\u2019s guards quickly get the upper hand and for a moment all seems lost, but Lucien wins over the guards by swearing that his brother\u2019s cause is just and dramatically vowing to kill him with his own sword if Napoleon ever betrays the principles of the Revolution. The guards arrest Barras, and Napoleon seizes the government, vowing to bring liberty, equality, and fraternity to all. Talleyrand celebrates over champagne with Fouch\u00e9 and Garrau who toast his brilliant political cunning (\u201cA Cutthroat Game\u201d).\n\nInstalled in the Tuileries Palace, Josephine berates Napoleon for his crassness and lack of table manners after a mortifying state dinner with the Emperor of Prussia. She sets out to teach him manners. Talleyrand waits impatiently for Napoleon to sign some pressing treaties. He resents the power Josephine holds over Napoleon, and is delighted when an assassination attempt on Napoleon kills her. This is quickly revealed to be his fantasy \u2013 Josephine has survived \u2013 but the assassination attempt was real, and it prompts Talleyrand to advise Napoleon to enshrine his power in a dynasty and become emperor. This idea is seductively irresistible to Napoleon (\u201cI Am the Revolution\u201d). Lucien is horrified and draws his sword to honour his vow to kill Napoleon but can\u2019t bring himself to do it, and is imprisoned (\u201cThe Calm Before the Storm\u201d). Talleyrand convinces Napoleon to exile Lucien, and arranges Napoleon\u2019s coronation (\u201cTimor Mortis\u201d). As the crown is about to be placed on Napoleon\u2019s head, we are privy to his thoughts and get an ominous glimpse of where absolute power will take him (\u201cSweet Victory Divine\u201d).\n\n### Act II\n\nFour years after the coronation, the empire is prospering. As the power behind the throne, Talleyrand has become obscenely wealthy (\u201cMade by Talleyrand\u201d). Though he\u2019d rather we didn\u2019t find out about his childhood, we do \u2013 in a flashback where we learn his parents abandoned him. Repulsed by his deformity and convinced he\u2019d amount to nothing, they inflicted the emotional scars fueling his hunger for success.\n\nAnton has been traveling with the emperor on a state visit as his aide de camp. Henri orders Clarice to forget about Anton, unaware that Clarice and Anton have committed to each other (\u201cA Promise\u201d). Anton gives her a necklace promising to love her as his wife even though Henri will never permit them to marry. Clarice, now Josephine\u2019s lady-in-waiting, says she\u2019ll speak to the empress and persuade her to convince Henri to allow their marriage.\n\nTalleyrand presses Napoleon on the need for an heir. Josephine has been unable to conceive. Talleyrand deliberately lets slip to Napoleon that he suspects her prior miscarriage is to blame. Napoleon knows nothing of this and, in a flashback, we learn with Napoleon what happened right after his marriage (\u201cPlombi\u00e8res\u201d). Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, certain that Napoleon would be killed in his new command, had arranged for Josephine to meet a wealthy aristocrat in the spa town of Plombi\u00e8res. When Josephine rebuffed the idea, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se drugged Josephine\u2019s wine to get her over her inhibitions. The result was an unintended pregnancy that Josephine terminated with a deliberate fall to cause a miscarriage. Talleyrand concludes it may have left her barren. Napoleon is devastated to learn of this secret that Josephine has kept from him all these years (\u201cSecrets Kill\u201d). Th\u00e9r\u00e8se suffers deep regret for having interfered in her friend\u2019s life (\u201cIf We Could Start Again\u201d).\n\nMonths later, Napoleon has yet to confront Josephine with what he knows, but upon returning home from an imperial tour to a ball in celebration of the empress\u2019 popularity, he can\u2019t bring himself to dance with her (\u201cOur Lady of Victories\u201d). Josephine struggles to understand his change towards her. Talleyrand presses him to tell her about their \u201cexperiment\u201d while on tour. Napoleon has successfully sired a bastard. Josephine\u2019s infertility is now confirmed. Talleyrand brutally presses ahead, convincing Napoleon to divorce Josephine (\u201cSaint Napoleon\u2019s Day\u201d) and Josephine retreats from the public eye to protect her broken heart (\u201cWalls of Stone\u201d).\n\nNapoleon\u2019s new marriage to an Austrian princess, arranged by Talleyrand, is loveless, but it produces the heir the empire needs. Barras contacts Napoleon from prison to reveal that Talleyrand was involved in Josephine\u2019s miscarriage, and in a flashback we witness the events at Plombi\u00e8res from a different perspective. Napoleon learns that it was Talleyrand who arranged the collapse of the balcony which left Josephine barren (\u201cBalcony\u201d). Napoleon is enraged and fires Talleyrand.\n\nRussia breaks its treaty with France, and an unhinged Napoleon announces his plans to march on Moscow, a vision that spirals out of control into delusions of world domination (\u201cThe Last Crusade\u201d). Talleyrand revenges his firing by leaking Napoleon\u2019s plans to the Russians, sealing the army\u2019s fate to perish in winter (\u201cRussia\u201d). Among the freezing soldiers, Anton and Henri reconcile their differences through their shared love of Clarice, and while Clarice and other wives and mothers cling to the futile hope that their loved ones will return, Anton and Henri perish in the cold (\u201cWaiting and Hoping\u201d). With the army\u2019s defeat, Talleyrand has Napoleon exiled to the Island of Elba. The foulest deed of his life \u2013 leaking the plans to Russia \u2013 has resulted in his greatest reward: he is now president of the new French government. But he finds he is nothing without Napoleon.\n\nOn Elba, Napoleon is devastated to learn of Josephine\u2019s death (\u201cJosephine\u2019s Death\u201d). Th\u00e9r\u00e8se writes that she was with her at the end and that Josephine wanted Napoleon to know she forgave him. Awash with regret and remorse for the harm he caused her, Napoleon struggles to understand how her forgiveness can be possible. He imagines her dying in his arms as she recollects the man he was when they met. She prays that one day he\u2019ll know peace and promises she\u2019ll be waiting for him.\n\nIn Paris, Talleyrand learns that Napoleon has been determined to return to power since learning of Josephine\u2019s death. He tries to have him poisoned, but Napoleon escapes from Elba and stages a dramatic return, longing to recapture his past glories. But the fields of Waterloo are all that await and he is unable to command, a ghost of his former self. As his marshals beg him to give the order to advance, they can only watch helplessly as their troops are slaughtered (\u201cWaterloo\u201d).\n\nTalleyrand realizes that in turning Napoleon away from those he loved, he failed to see \u201cthe one great truth\u201d \u2013 that life is relationships: without them we are broken (\u201cFinale\u201d). Talleyrand mourns the man Napoleon was, the man he destroyed (\u201cDream Within Reprise\u201d).",
